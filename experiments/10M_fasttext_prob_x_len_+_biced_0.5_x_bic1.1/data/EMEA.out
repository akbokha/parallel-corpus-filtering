&quot; the present document is a summary of the European public reference report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains , as the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) , discussed the study carried out in order to promote recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information about your illness or their treatment , please read the package information ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 m@@ g. , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of hot @-@ tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things which are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , an psychological illness in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal up@@ time ) altern@@ ating normal mood . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased ag@@ itation or behavi@@ oral dysfunction if the oral medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be applied to one or the melt tablets in patients , where the swal@@ lowing of tablets is prepared . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use other medicines at the same time , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ geon zo@@ l probably works mainly as &quot; partial ag@@ ulation &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l such as 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but at lower measurements than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter is to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby preventing psychological or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their re @-@ occur . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , which prevent re @-@ occur symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of injection solution was compared to two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which compared to increased ag@@ itation , compared to two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent repe@@ ating in 160 patients where the man@@ ian symptoms were stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which compared to increased ag@@ itation , which compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , changes in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scope for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tray , and the solution to take @-@ out ( up ) . &quot;
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg , or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased ag@@ itation than the patient who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was reduced in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo treated the repet@@ ition of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered to an existing treatment . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also reduced the symptoms of increased ag@@ itation and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( greater movement ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision ( increased s@@ ali@@ ation ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision ( increased s@@ ali@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , ru@@ dol@@ ence , in@@ som@@ ni@@ fication ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from medium to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable for the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder , and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day every day independently of meals .
&quot; an increased effectiveness of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , ir@@ respective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been demonstrated .
&quot; with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered to be considered to justify clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is removed from combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ tic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psychological diseases and aff@@ ection disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , including treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ geon zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder showed no increased addic@@ tive risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ emia disease , conditions which can be pre@@ valent for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( di@@ eh@@ y@@ dr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure medication ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ geon dy@@ l . &quot;
&quot; when an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be taken into consideration , to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics have to be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ geon was to be applied in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ut@@ ations in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , or in conditions that are related to cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ fare in connection with caution . &quot;
56 - 99 years old ) associated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ geon &apos;s disease were increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ wanted frag@@ ility events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there is no accurate risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic therapies , which allow direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ them , poly@@ mer@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally consistent with sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is observed , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle can lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is recommended if Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines with side @-@ side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ geons , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) increased by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; in terms of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; ) , the common application can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively @-@ intensive metabolism . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ants , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l per day no significant effect on the metabol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ology morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to inform her doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the in@@ adequate data situation for safety during humans and due to the reproductive studies in the animal experiments this medication may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is just@@ ifies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to serve until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side @-@ listed side effects are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ geons , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled @-@ term study of about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % were treated with patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ geons , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with arith@@ me@@ tic@@ le@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term research period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also associated with Ari@@ pi@@ geon &apos;s disease , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , adverse dy@@ sk@@ in@@ agen@@ esia and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or intenti@@ onally acute over@@ do@@ si@@ cs were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 m@@ g. and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ ost@@ ic in the treatment of an overdose using Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ iling in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefit is as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma cord . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ geons in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine case . &quot;
&quot; with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the Pos@@ it@@ ome emissions tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , an D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the tur@@ key . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
&quot; in a semi @-@ sensitive study , 52 % of the patients who participated in the study group participated in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values of measured values defined as secondary study samples , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - scale scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and included in the primary study target of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg ) . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a higher effect on placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosage with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherap@@ ies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed a higher effect of placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l also showed 12 compar@@ ative share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia on such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed an excessive effectiveness in reducing the reduction of therapeutic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase , in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar recovery , predominantly at prevention of a bi@@ polar return in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ zo@@ l , which is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cataly@@ st . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l with extensive metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic investigation sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients were no sexually dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences on ethnic origin or the impact of the space on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic properties were similar to patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects . &quot;
&quot; a single dose study of subjects with various acute liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to draw locks on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in a repeat@@ able gift , reproduction cel@@ icity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ ic potential , the pre@@ clinical data sent no specific dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects have been observed in dos@@ ages or Ex@@ positions , which have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
effects of a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent side effect ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 times the medium @-@ ady Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) during the recommended maximum dose during humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the result of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys based on a repeated oral skill of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no longer than 6 % of the concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses taken to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11@@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ geon dy@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ geons in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day every day regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulties with the swal@@ low of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , the melting tray may alternatively be taken to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psychological diseases and aff@@ ection disturb@@ ances in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , including treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ geon zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

the following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than on placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a higher effect on placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ geons in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and included in the primary study target of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg ) . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosage with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l was compared to intake with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ geon in tablet into healthy volunteers , the ratio was between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max -@@ mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;

&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses taken to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11@@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ ours in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar I disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; once clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to increase the absorption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under envel@@ opes of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be used dependent on individual clinical status taking into consideration the drug or acute or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further leading oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l inde@@ xed , refer to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution . &quot;
there are no investigations to the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral disorders that were different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; in case of critical therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tion@@ solution as necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme resistance or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
tests on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l injection solution for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( not written or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ emia disease , conditions which can be pre@@ valent for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( di@@ eh@@ y@@ dr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure medication ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ geon dy@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ts , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ them , poly@@ mer@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally consistent with sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is observed or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of Sed@@ an &apos;s Sed@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ one study in the healthy test of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) as disposable in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ geons , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can also be combined with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 to higher plasma concentrations . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ eas@@ ants , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

in the long @-@ term research period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral dysfunction associated with statistically significant improvements in the symptoms regarding the ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
&quot; the observed improvement of the output value at the P@@ AN@@ SS , Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analysis of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy in relation to the total population was observed , but statistical significance was determined due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a semi @-@ sensitive study , 52 % of the patients who participated in the study group participated in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values of Mess@@ sk@@ als defined as secondary study samples , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg scale scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( oral ) a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and included in the primary study target of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy in reducing the reduction of reduction in reduction symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase , in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar recovery , predominantly at prevention of a bi@@ polar return in the Man@@ ie . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of 90 % bigger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulation .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma cutting is 1 @-@ 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , resulting in any direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated gift in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies for the reproductive medicine after intraven@@ ous application , there were no safety relevant concerns after the maternal exposure that was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , reproduction cel@@ icity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and the can@@ ic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not recognise any special dangers for human beings . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a study study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in general administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; one considers only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously obtained other treatments of metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in patients , the breast@@ feeding , or before the onset of treatment , low @-@ neutral density in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was contained in patients with which the first treatment was no longer an@@ gled , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medication should not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Abra@@ practice Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited to grant the approval of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and not shown for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ in @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neutral cycles &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; for sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy degrees 3 , treatment is to be canc@@ eled until a better level 1 or 2 is achieved , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of Dos@@ age adjustments in patients with mild to moderate adjustment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with affected ren@@ al function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of Dos@@ age adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data to the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ arti@@ kel@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have much more pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; when an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should not be treated once again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients there should be no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles , which has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with heavy liver function ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while clearly , cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity is not detected , cardi@@ ac incid@@ ents in the inde@@ xed patient collection are not unusual , especially in patients with early patient anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or degra@@ dation heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these can be treated with the usual antibodies and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used with pregnant women or women in the blo@@ ated age , which are not an effective conception , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot;
women in the blo@@ o@@ able age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable verification method .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be enriched , during and up to six months after treatment no child . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised against treatment via a sperm cell , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very frequently ) and dizziness ( frequently ) that can work on the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; listed below are the most common and most important incid@@ ents of adverse events , which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study . &quot;
&quot; neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of the patients ) , and quickly re@@ versi@@ bly and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients . &quot;
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; table 1 , the side effects are performed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherap@@ ies at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli drug that promotes the combination of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their land@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
these stabili@@ zation lead to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mi@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in is medi@@ ated in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is promoting the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ os@@ es@@ or is con@@ veys and due to the alb@@ umin@@ bin@@ der Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( b@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the range of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two @-@ sto@@ cky studies and from 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ entr@@ e study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy associated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of sol@@ vent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; when recording into the study , 64 % of patients had an adverse general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ amps . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general contact rate and time until progression free survival and survival for patients , who received &gt; First @-@ Line therapy , are presented below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who lived at a time during the therapy a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy to bas@@ eline at Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the range of active exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 According to intraven@@ ous gifts of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took up in multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or crossover network of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift , the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in first line to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ abolic .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the average total of 4 % of the overall average total dose of 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , resulting in a wide @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , over patients aged over 75 years , however , only few data are available , because only 3 patients of these age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic analysis . &quot;

this means that Ab@@ se@@ wer is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and is the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference ti@@ dings &quot; ) .
&quot; in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which a blood trans@@ fusion may occur in patients , if a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected before the procedure . &quot;
&quot; treatment with bott@@ oms must be conducted under the supervision of a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases which is shown for the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients , who want to make a self @-@ bleeding is in@@ jected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; injection can also be made from the patient , or by the car@@ ing officer , if they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients who receive chemotherapy should always lie at the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to control before the treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency consists of , and ice @-@ energ@@ y@@ supplements should be given throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or therefore that the body does not adequ@@ ately stim@@ ulate the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa .
&quot; when injection was approved as an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , an@@ emia is compared with the reference rate . &quot;
all patients participating in this study was in@@ jected at least eight weeks at E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they either were converted to se@@ ed@@ uled or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main inde@@ struc@@ table for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the study period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company posted the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled aby@@ ss with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ og@@ lob@@ sters were killed in the same degree as in those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients , which continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise from 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ wer is an increase of blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , cre@@ eping mig@@ rate of heada@@ ches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients , possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; abor@@ tion as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treatment of kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that they are not triggered by any allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the medicine has been approved in accordance with the rules of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has been a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for medical professionals , the company , which accounts for medical personnel in all Member States , will provide information on the safety of the drug . &quot;

&quot; treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ adequate , for a major blood @-@ volume proposition ( 4 or more units blood at women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; due to a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic procedure in adults , it can be applied to adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion applications is expected . &quot;
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied not to participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood@@ thirsty program .
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except at p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,8 m@@ mol / l ) should lie . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease last ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease activity is required by the doctor . &quot;
a increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally patients can be observed with individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster values or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in combination . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ og@@ ging vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached to 12 g / d@@ g ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / d@@ g ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored eng@@ aging , to ensure that ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and swelling symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl , or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher education doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl , or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher yields as patients with which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 i.e. / kg three times per week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 i.e. / kg ( three times per week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should be done at least 4 weeks in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms , gender , and overall disease may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease last ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ og@@ ging vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached to 12 g / d@@ g ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored eng@@ aging , to ensure that ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of the treatment symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value increased by at least 1 g / ml ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the reverse total of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , the dose should be retained three times per week or 450 tons / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise is &lt; 1 g / ml ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , the dose should be increased to 300 i.e. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 i.e. / kg three times per week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value , ≥ 1 g / d@@ g ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ hole number ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , the dose should be retained three times per week . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value increased by &lt; 1 g / ml ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the reverse value of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , a response to the ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely to be canc@@ eled and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , which is required for the pre@@ supply of ≥ 4 blood @-@ conservative , should be preserved in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg of body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to the operative procedure . &quot;
&quot; with the iron sub@@ stitution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ation of blood canc@@ ers - began to provide large iron reserves before the beginning of the se@@ wer therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 i.e. / kg ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa , which should be given weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ operative 300 i.e. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a f@@ ist@@ le , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to make the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the cycle . &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin to a ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia ( PR@@ CA ) should not be preserved or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin ( see section 4.4 - Ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ab@@ mb@@ osis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;

ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the occurr@@ ence of an anti@@ gen @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to year @-@ long treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of response , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased requirements for non @-@ failure ( iron , folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminum loss , infections or infections , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ te is measured , taking into consideration of an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; Index &quot; ) , the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ te are normally determined , and if no other cause of any response is measured , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ric antibodies are intended and an investigation of the bone mar@@ marks to diag@@ nose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in patients with risk @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded at the 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in targets .
&quot; in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular events were observed , when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese stim@@ ulate active ingredients ( ESA ) were given to a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in combination of more than 12 g / d@@ g ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit which is attributable to the gift of ep@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased to control of swelling symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required concentration .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ g ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of hypertension .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , clinical evidence of corne@@ al disease or dust @-@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded in compliance with the 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in targets . &quot;
&quot; according to the present detection , initial analysis is not accelerated by the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa in adults with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy for the assessment of therapy @-@ efficiency of ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin answer should be taken into account ( patients who may be trans@@ lu@@ des ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 , to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ al events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ y@@ ric an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adap@@ tion , to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction among the respective patients who should also consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients that are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go to a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure should have an appropriate thro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ osis and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a ro@@ un@@ ting cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with an initial offset value of &gt; 13 g / dl can withstand increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ osis / v@@ ascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ et@@ ine is not proven to improve the overall survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be adjusted to increasing hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro examinations on tumor tissue , no indications have been found on an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F for hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of thro@@ mb@@ osis , vas@@ cul@@ ous events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ di@@ ale , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , in@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys , also reported patients under ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine treatment . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is a dos@@ ing increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
increased incidence of resistance ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treatment , it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ ating to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically modified ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa is gly@@ ko@@ si@@ zed and on the amino acids and carbohydrates , identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , which was isolated from the urine of endemic patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mark@@ s@@ cells that ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa stimul@@ ates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese and not influenced the Leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .

survival and tumor cells were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in total survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients with an@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ ant consistent , statistically significantly higher mortality than in controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in combination of human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients and inspec@@ tions .
&quot; it is an elevated risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ting events , treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied how far this results in the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ised ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine in tumour patient treated with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as few patients were included in the checked data . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations for repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ time period of about 4 hours in healthy subjects , and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that can be achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mark@@ fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study on hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis patients , three years with ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa were treated , the incidence of bone mark@@ fibro@@ sis was treated with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , not increased ) . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal studies with nearly 20 times of the application of people recommended in the day of the day of the week , ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa led ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ric body weight , to a delay of oscill@@ ation and to a rise of fat@@ ality mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based in vitro findings with cells from human@@ ised tumor tissue samples , which are of uns@@ afe significance . &quot;

&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with graduation rings and the filling volume is shown by a adhesive label , so that if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
treatment with se@@ wer must be guided under supervision of doctors to have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .

&quot; during treatment with bott@@ oms , it may occur within the standardi@@ zation of a slight dos@@ is@@ omy increase in blood circulation numbers , which re@@ plen@@ ish further treatment . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will conduct regular blood tests , in order to regularly control the number of blood spots during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; iron gel , resolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fol@@ acid rule , should be taken into account and treated before the onset of therapy with bott@@ om@@ ers . &quot;
very rare was reported about the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ physical ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia for months to year @-@ long treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous water ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin .
&quot; if you suffer from Ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia , it will break your therapy with se@@ ed@@ uled and define how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , abor@@ tion must be given through injection in a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated due to an@@ emia due to a kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the ster@@ il@@ iko could be increased .
&quot; in increased or increasing , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with bott@@ oms , until the potassium values are again in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ di@@ ac disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels will not exceed a particular value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present detection , the treatment of blood @-@ poverty with abor@@ tion in adults with chronic kidney weakness ( kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , is not accelerated to progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of bott@@ oms .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ es ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and to adjust their lax@@ ative dose to keep the risk of a blood flow ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic event ) as possible .
&quot; this risk should be carried out very carefully from the treatment of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al v@@ ascular events , especially if you have occurred an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cul@@ ous events , e.g. if you have occurred in the past , thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cul@@ ous events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ er@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ wer can affect how a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can affect the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if an orthop@@ ae@@ dic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , it should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment of your an@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ es ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get bott@@ led , as an elevated risk of blood flow formation after surgery exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you use other medicines / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for the supp@@ ression of the immune system ) during your therapy , your doctor may apply to certain blood tests , in order to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory studies have no interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) as a means for the construction of the immune system , for example in cancer - chemotherapy or HIV . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood alarm ( an@@ emia ) is applied on treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will also arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment result and ensure that the medicine works correctly and does not exceed your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value .
&quot; as soon as you are well adjusted , regular doses are between 25 and 50 i.e. / kg twice weekly , distributed to two equal injec@@ tions . &quot;
your doctor will also arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment result and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia is applied on treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks , until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this , ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treatment doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the treatment time is required before the surgery , a dose of 300 i.e. / kg can be given at 10 consecutive days before the operation , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the operation . &quot;

&quot; when a syr@@ inge from the refrigerator has been taken and room temperature is reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days , but must be rejected . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women according to the men@@ opause and men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone break ) , including patients who have suffered a lower trau@@ mat@@ ri@@ p as they have suffered ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changed the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should be obtained from the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , there was a part of the data material for zom@@ eta to review A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of vert@@ eb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures were investigated over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hips , and the number of frac@@ tures were investigated over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two trials in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to 6 months with the ri@@ val@@ ine ( another bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) . &quot;
main inde@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme which builds bone calcium ) in the blood re@@ norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ eb@@ re@@ tions in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hips , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are often less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients that are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ates or other components .
&quot; as in all Bis@@ phosph@@ ates patients , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physicians , which includes A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the medicine is explained and indicated that when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in males , a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic strain , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the supply of the hips . ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long post @-@ emission period was observed in patients receiving treatment ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , according to a minimum of 500 mg of essential calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to ensure ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently cont@@ enti@@ ous low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , the initial dose is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney problems ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experiences for these patient groups are present .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose custom@@ ization is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger . &quot;
children and you@@ ths A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data are missing for the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as recommended for this patient population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ f@@ ences before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is sufficient to treat calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to fast setting the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary , mit@@ less symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ine , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occurs ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be weighed in front of an application of bis@@ phosph@@ ates with adequate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients receiving dental handles , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates are reduced the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the pine area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treated doctor should be the basis for treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; symptoms of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced shortly after the application of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of serious adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ tor@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall stiff@@ ness of pre @-@ hop@@ ed between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney disorder z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was used with kidney dysfunction associated as a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases referred to as acute kidney failure .
the change of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) were included in patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus passport studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recent extra@@ cting cr@@ ushing , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion device , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the Kiev region , especially in cancer patients , above oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the Kie@@ fer@@ ment area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , treated . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients or other dental patients . &quot;

&quot; in case of overdose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ene , can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year at post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) -@@ t Score for the cas@@ u@@ als ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ serious spine as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing spine .
effects of morph@@ omet@@ ric duc@@ tor A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ eb@@ re@@ frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had reduced by 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a effects had a lasting effect on three years , resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar ic acid , hips and at the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ asing bone density of lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the total hips around 6.0 % , the lower level by 5,1 % and the dist@@ al radius around 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients , which were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 70 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ let . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed a patient treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to placebo an increased bone volume and the preser@@ ving of the traction bone architecture .
&quot; bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the Type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ ep@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in perio@@ dic intervals during study period from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients . &quot;
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment , the BM@@ D to all time points . &quot;
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total amount and 4.3 % at the legs .
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon R@@ FT study were randomised , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated males compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
&quot; in another study involving men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was included in comparison to the percentage of the Leningrad BM@@ D in comparison to 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
clinical efficacy of treating Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ wer A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed ( mean serum @-@ mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
&quot; 11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily , during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of combined results , a similar decrease of the pain strength and pain of pain was observed compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ ses at the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) could be recorded during a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with the ri@@ val@@ ed patients who participated in the after@@ math study , the therapeutic approach of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was compared with 71 of the patients treated with the risk of ris@@ otto with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes long in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bars rapidly increased from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 hours and &lt; 1 % to 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; turn@@ out bi@@ phase van@@ ishes from the large cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period of ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early distribution phases ( α and β with the above mentioned ½ -@@ values ) represent the fast Res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the used dose in urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the full body @-@ cle@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race , or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ re@@ - concentration of 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface beneath the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ concentration versus time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes met@@ abolic substances is unlikely to met@@ abolic because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abolic in humans and because it is a weak or no more direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Creative @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a regular kidney problems down to a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min is no dos@@ ing adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; because of heavy kidney problems ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- cle@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body@@ weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies of dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered at intervals of 2 - 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ 86 of human therapeutic exposure to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which had exceeded the maximum of the human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects came with other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ative primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cal bone of animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , a evidence that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , one observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal tox@@ icity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of serious serum @-@ calcium @-@ mirror . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ orus , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in males and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen formed from Andro@@ s , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by norm@@ alized the bone structure , thus ensuring a normal bone formation and gives the bone again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or to under@@ go a dental surgery , please inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the care personnel if you have taken other medicines / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , of which it is known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food and drinks , you are concerned that you will take enough liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or care personnel as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to increase the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the supply of the ridge . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg taken to you from your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may require a further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow this instructions exactly so that the calcium @-@ mirror in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can work longer than a year and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a failed to put you immediately with your doctor or hospital in connection to make a new date .
&quot; before the end of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls you consider the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; adverse events in connection with the first in@@ fusion occurs very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions are often less frequently . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes these irregular heartbeat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the care personnel , if one of the listed side effects are considerably imp@@ aired or you notice side effects , which are not listed in this manual formation . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used directly , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions up to application , usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently cont@@ enti@@ ous low @-@ trau@@ matic thigh , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to increase two or more weeks after the supply of the hips . &quot;
&quot; prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be adequ@@ ately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive medical therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the fast setting of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic abandoned , hypo@@ kal@@ ene may develop , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of essential calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently cont@@ enti@@ ous low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , a starting dose is recommended between 50,000 and 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information about your illness or their treatment , please read the package information ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is also used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients ( BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • the overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond that one or more
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was deployed to a placebo in comparison to a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to these studies on the setting of the room , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to estimate on this application area . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were detected during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . ng The complete list of adverse events related to A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA . &quot;
&quot; it must also be applied in patients that suffer from an existing depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can cause the risk of depression , and among other things , with a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is provided with simultaneous application of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA with medication such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means for use at H@@ IV@@ - Inf@@ ection ) , Tel@@ i@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or Cl@@ arith@@ me@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA in relation to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight &quot;
&quot; patients are applied in patients who need health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( due to provision of clari@@ fication for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the absence of data on the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; at up to 10 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant with depres@@ sive symptoms or mood changes were reported in up to 10 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in depres@@ sive disturb@@ ances , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied , unless the benefit of treatment in individual case weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients suffering from obesity - no recogni@@ zable risks , depres@@ sive reactions occur . &quot;

&quot; in addition , SS@@ E had examined patients as well as patients with an obesity and also in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications . &quot;
&quot; the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of adverse adverse reactions in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients , which were treated for weight reduction , and due to accompanying met@@ abolic diseases . &quot;
&quot; if the incidence was statistically significant higher than the corresponding placebo ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng At the evaluation of side effects are basically laid down following areas : &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of individuals were given up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an simultaneously existing hypertension and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ mia .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European public reference report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains , as the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) , explained to recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric medicine ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric medicine ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) can be applied , which can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ sives or insulin can be retained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ substance or insulin can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better im@@ bur@@ sed and the blood sugar level decreases , reducing type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy were examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of metal form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were lowered at the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the triple therapy , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ sives in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift from placebo resulted in a lowering of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ ate and insulin was investigated at 289 patients , patients who in addition to insulin was compared with 0.@@ 69 % compared to 6 months compared with 0.@@ 14 % compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were vision problems , infections of the upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used either in patients , possibly excessive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ one ( high ket@@ ones ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients should not appear in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited sent an approval for the account of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus whose blood sugar has in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate in which met@@ form@@ in are in@@ adequate ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or eyel@@ ids , especially those with reduced kar@@ ate reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and eyel@@ ids , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ous out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ous disease was carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure showed that , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
patients with increased output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal area ) or other signs of liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; if AL@@ T mirrors can increase up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver cells are as soon as possible to control again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has developed symptoms that refer to a tan@@ gible dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , th@@ at@@ ism , fatigue , loss of appetite , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver cells . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the presence of the laboratory parameters should be led by the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases linked with liquid re@@ spiration . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a ha@@ modified treatment , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one performed a low reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used as oral dual or triple combination therapy with insulin therapy and insulin therapy with insulin @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ als , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , has been reported on an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ms with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular de@@ ms , however , doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ ms ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages undes@@ ired events regarding bone hat@@ ch from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials involving over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the calculated questionna@@ ires was 1.9 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years , treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 questionna@@ ires per 100 patients for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fac@@ tions per 100 patient years ) were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient is a pregnancy , or if this occurs , the treatment is decreasing ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the analysis of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on have no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with medication used by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ or are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is primarily attributable to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , which reduces hyper@@ thy@@ ine emia and increased insulin resistance to the breast cancer , thereby reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change of the Tur@@ g@@ or and the refra@@ ctive index , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents emerged as much as the three times the upper limit of the norm@@ ality as much as placebo , however less than in comparison groups under metal in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study of patients with existing advanced macro@@ ph@@ atic illness , the frequency of a heavy heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , it was rarely reported about heart failure below Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but often if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages undes@@ ired incid@@ ents from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials were carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative groups . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years running PRO@@ active study , questionna@@ ires were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) which were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day after seven days there were no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to effect on an activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( PA@@ R @-@ g ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripher@@ al glucose in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years in order to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the onset of the therapy , a blood sugar monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 12 months , patients , whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate in spite of the three @-@ month optimization , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced to 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continued only insulin . a reduction of insulin treatment in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ quota compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was checked in a small , 18 @-@ week examination of type 2 diabe@@ tic labels . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as slightly lower , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was no statistically significant increase in the L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased significantly . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not only the sober tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pon@@ dial elevated tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , both via a effect on the tri@@ glyceri@@ des absorption as well as to the tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced macro@@ ph@@ atic disease were random@@ ized to receive either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , with the top concentration of the un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to efficacy in about three times of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was mainly found in threads ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active met@@ abolic rate is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function in patients with reduced kidney function .
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys are matched after repeated administration of plasma , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is primarily attributable to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , which reduces hyper@@ thy@@ ine emia and increased insulin resistance to the matern@@ ity and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced in the rat of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epithel@@ ium epithel@@ ium .
&quot; in a animal model of the family @-@ familiar poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ als resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated questionna@@ ires was 1.9 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years , treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 questionna@@ ires per 100 patients for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fac@@ tions per 100 patient years ) were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ quota compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was not only the sober tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pon@@ dial elevated tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , both via an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic absorption as well as on the p@@ yl@@ lic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing the objective of its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the Kn@@ uck@@ les , Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ er Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation Site , Cor@@ on@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ ac@@ ons are not linked to cardiovascular risk @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;

&quot; after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which suggests that blood sugar levels were greatly reduced compared to another human@@ ist . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients that possibly react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human@@ kind ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may have to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the package slope ) . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ one in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to grant approval for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products normally applied once or twice daily , if a fast initi@@ ational effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
injection no@@ zzle must be placed under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the total dose was in@@ jected .
&quot; patients whose blood glucose is significantly improved through an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning sy@@ symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( quickly acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ phase insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human@@ kind or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin of animal origin ) may result in a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient a dose custom@@ ization is required , this may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal in human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or differently than with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; traveling to travel through several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor , as such travels can also be applied to other times or taken to be taken . &quot;
&quot; the doctor must therefore consider possible inter@@ actions in the therapy , and his patients always ask medicines in other medicines . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already feature signs of cryst@@ all@@ ations , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gyp@@ sum notes ( &quot; Stones , &quot; i.e. greater urine cryst@@ alli@@ ances that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary levels after two to four weeks is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to a day of 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , tox@@ ic@@ an@@ cies may occur ; therefore it is recommended that the patient will take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor any further medicines for prevention of tox@@ ins . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transpl@@ ant because it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ drug treatment ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol applied in a dose of 300 mg per day ; patients with kidney problems received just 100 mg per day . &quot;
main inde@@ struc@@ table for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary levels in the blood was under 6 mg / d@@ g .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who had Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who had taken over 120 mg per day in the last three measurements , in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with cardiovascular problems , an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the urine mirror in the blood , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one of the patient &apos;s history , and / or a arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the serum for 2 @-@ 4 weeks still reaches &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose of dose to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al function , the efficacy and safety of safety were not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- cle@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people , when there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; transpl@@ ant recei@@ vers , as it does not exist with organ transpl@@ ant recei@@ vers , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases in patients with academic heart disease or cereb@@ ral heart failure is not recommended for the treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; like with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ al medicines , it can occur during the treatment of acute tox@@ icity , because due to lowering the serum @-@ acid levels of urine are first to be mobili@@ zed in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ e@@ Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine cases in rare cases that happens so far that it comes to an ag@@ itation in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease During clinical trials of phase 3 have been observed slightly ab@@ normal@@ ities of the liver function in with Feb@@ . ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function prior to the beginning of Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static treatment and during clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ ia were not performed any rate effects to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
&quot; for volunteers the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated to 250 mg 2 times a day with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the use of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors did not appear in connection with clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in or without that a dose adap@@ tion to Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or the same same active ingredient is required .
&quot; in a study involving subjects of 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily , a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C by Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible moderate @-@ scale effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ azi@@ d@@ um containing magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide , which causes the absorption of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and caused a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change of AU@@ C causes . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of pregn@@ an@@ cies don &apos;t let side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at on pregnancy or health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not suffer from direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful with the tax of a vehicle , serving machines or exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reason@@ ably safe to ensure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has not affected their performance . &quot;
a pay@@ able higher incidence of the test results reported cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ous events in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al study of the phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) observed that no statistically significant differences were found and no emotional connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compos@@ itional heart failure in the hospital history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and in all February ost@@ at treatment groups have been listed below .
&quot; diar@@ rhoea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients that are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies there were no severe skin rash or serious damage actions . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open @-@ term renewal studies In the open long @-@ term renewal studies were treated 906 for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients were treated for up to 3 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events reported during the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in the phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with a positioning period of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patients ) , according to information occasionally . &quot;
the subsequent treatment condition were either reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies of the phase 3 for these doses either at all or with a lower frequency :

active mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of Pur@@ in@@ met@@ ism and arises within the framework of the reaction sk@@ ask@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ Pur@@ in sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with a Ki @-@ value for the in vitro inhibit@@ or , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX trial and F@@ ACT study as shown below ) which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of patients who had the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with an serum value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / d@@ g . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering the serum mirror to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed in the physician &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintain permanently about the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney problems . the AP@@ EX trial evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney @-@ function ( d. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
there were no clinical significant differences regarding the percentage of the serum concentration of the serum concentration in subjects ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / d@@ ash E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had an serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; in two years , data collected from the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of the patients were needed in the period 16 @-@ 24 ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , that less than 3 % of the patients needed treatment against a pois@@ ons ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a pois@@ oning ) . &quot;
this was associated with a reduction of gyp@@ sy size in 54 % of patients who had a complete disappearance of gre@@ ens up to month 24 .
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) , and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the Plas@@ ma@@ concentrations time curve ( AU@@ C ) by Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at after administration is easier and multi@@ pl@@ ers from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase . &quot;
after taking simpler or multiple doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage of the serum concentration of the serum concentration of the serum concentration ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range of 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma cutting bond of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites showed that this oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ . 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 arises . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ edly Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at about 49 % of the dose in urine as un@@ changeable Feb@@ ant ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ Glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the drug ( 30 % ) , whose conf@@ use oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 3 % ) as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tions about the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose found in the chair as un@@ changeable Feb@@ . ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ Glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the drug ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the average total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by around 1.8 times from 7.5 m g , h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ , h / ml in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;

&quot; age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects . &quot;
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ ese , impair@@ ment of fer@@ til@@ ity In male rats , was found statistically significant in relation to X@@ an@@ thin stones in the high @-@ level treated group , with about 11 fold of exposure to people . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ met@@ alli@@ zation and urine composition and not relevant for clinical use as a result .
it was found that Feb@@ . ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertili@@ zation and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , approximately at 4.@@ 3- of the human@@ ist exposure , maternal tox@@ icity emerged , which went up with a lowering of the cooling performance and a development delay with the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in tra@@ cing rats with ex@@ positions , which tot@@ alled approximately the 4.3 @-@ times and with tra@@ cing rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , showed no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are ro@@ ar ) in women according to men@@ opause , which is a risk of low vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or use other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient should not take place until after the first food intake of the day , which should not be done at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data to date from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who had exclusively alone income ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data to the present that contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose is exactly the dose that is required for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ e ( arter@@ ial disorders ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ al ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ al abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic fixing . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other ingredients may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients that can &apos;t stand upright at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January of January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Jack@@ et Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitality supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following references are just to follow the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed up only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not che@@ w or the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not be done before taking the tablet in the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. p@@ ept@@ ing ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ l@@ astic , only be given under special care ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ ums , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords ( partially these heavy and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore refer to all the signs and symptoms that are supposed to refer to potential reactions , such as dy@@ sent@@ in@@ ie , pain in the swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ ular pain or a new or lim@@ ber@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn the drug to obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious anti@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seem to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly , and / or it after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that refer to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ired irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions are given to the patient and understood from the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during a large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was detected no increased risk , some severe damage and complications of complications were reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ thro@@ sis of the j@@ aw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , has been reported primarily with cancer patients , their therap@@ eu@@ ime mainly administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to give evidence of whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ onic therapy in patients , which reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ idal surgery , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
the clinical assessment through the treatment doctor is crucial for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients must be instructed to taking the tablet into the intake of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet into the next morning after having noticed their failure .
&quot; they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the weekly day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to the start of the therapy .
&quot; alcoholic beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of alkal@@ ine at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at intake before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lact@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at have no indication to be seen directly with regard to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the j@@ aw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ onate , but most reports were reported by cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the serum samples of serum cal@@ ci@@ ary rose up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mol / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; in@@ sequence of an oral overdose can occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osphere at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach up@@ beat , so@@ d@@ burn , e@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , Gast@@ ritis or Ul@@ zer@@ a . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at on bone mass and fra@@ cture incidence at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ ktur inter@@ vention@@ ist study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in the phase III studies , the mean inc@@ endi@@ ces of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.8 % in the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ um and 7.8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D of the spine and trol@@ leys continued to continue , including the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ale and the entire body . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ em@@ ulated studies , at which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and after 10 m@@ g. daily continue to be taken either more than 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurr@@ ence of at least one new vert@@ eb@@ rates by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;

the bio@@ availability has increased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at had taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of alkal@@ i ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is distributed to intraven@@ ous gifts of 1 mg / kg temporary , but then divided into the bones or eliminated by urine . &quot;
&quot; separation After intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , approximately 50 % of the radioactive substance were eliminated within 72 hours with urine and no radio@@ activity was re@@ found in the threads . &quot;
according to intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance was not exceeding 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at will not be eliminated in rats over the aci@@ dic or bas@@ ic transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not accepted that humans have influenced other medicines by these transport systems .

&quot; the ex@@ cre@@ tion of radioactive content of radioactive vitamin D3 at healthy subjects were the mean loss of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours of 2.4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4.9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics of clinical trials with clinical studies have shown that the proportion of alkal@@ ine studies , which is not stored in the bones , will be eliminated quickly over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is above , nevertheless , the ren@@ al elimination of algae of algae as in animal experiments are also reduced to patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore patients with reduced kidney function can expect a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at in the bones ( see section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered adult patients who underwent a kidneys or liver transpl@@ an@@ ted to prevent the transpl@@ an@@ ion of transpl@@ an@@ ted transpl@@ ants through the immune system .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously conducted studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation , with the application of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; main inde@@ struc@@ tions of the efficacy was the number of patients , where the transpl@@ ant was observed after a treatment duration of a year ( by example , examined how often a new transpl@@ ant transpl@@ ant or recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and studied , as Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft is taken from the body . &quot;
&quot; disease , headache , nausea / vomiting , diar@@ rhoea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar level ( hypertension ) , blood pressure ( hypertension ) , and insom@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nie ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ lid antibiotics ( such as Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some vegetable ) drugs are taken at the same time with ad@@ den@@ raf , as the adult dose or dose of the drug may be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ sel@@ ess with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange cap with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
&quot; only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transpl@@ ant spati@@ ally , ought to as@@ sign this drug or changes in immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transpl@@ ant@@ ations or an increased incidence of adverse events , including sub or immun@@ immun@@ ity . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; calculation of formulation or regim@@ es should only be carried out under the nar@@ row@@ ful control of a medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adap@@ t@@ ations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ some will be preserved . &quot;
dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be based on the clinical assessment of ass@@ aul@@ ts and toler@@ ability in the individual and blood @-@ level regulations ( see below ) .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the T@@ AC@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ents should be controlled from the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 , the systemic exposure was measured as a valley mirror , with both formulation and both kidney @-@ transpl@@ an@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the T@@ AC@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ es are recommended throughout the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ math phase .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ Schem@@ as may take several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral medicines in the first postoperative phase , the T@@ AC@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) can be introduced with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application to supp@@ ression transpl@@ ants , the immun@@ os@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum length of oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
Dos@@ age recommendations - kidney transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft transpl@@ antation The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; other dose custom@@ iz@@ ations can be needed later , as pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after transpl@@ antation . &quot;
Dos@@ age recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft analysis The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; recommended dosage - change from pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must have an transpl@@ ant@@ itis of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to one once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , so this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , is based on the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ antation After a change@@ over of other immun@@ os@@ kel@@ y@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once a daily treatment with the recommended oral and liver transpl@@ ant recommended at the recommended oral initial dose for the proph@@ yla@@ xis .
&quot; in adult patients who are converted to ad@@ den@@ raf , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day . &quot;
&quot; other transpl@@ ants recei@@ vers Ob@@ probably there is no clinical experience with ad@@ den@@ raf in lung , pancre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ transpl@@ an@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with pancre@@ atic transpl@@ an@@ cies in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dos@@ ing adap@@ t@@ ations in special patient groups patients with restricted liver function for maintaining blood flow in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver function .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function has no effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose custom@@ ization is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als as of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular assignment of the serum concentration , a calculation of the in@@ in@@ in@@ ct and monitoring of urine volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf At the change@@ over of a c@@ ic@@ uous por@@ a to a T@@ AC@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution provided ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in the whole blood . the dose should be based on the clinical assessment of suction and toler@@ ability in the individual case under assistance by full @-@ blood @-@ T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ side controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls in the T@@ AC@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ Tal@@ king of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , changes of immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous application of substances that could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us full @-@ blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , custom@@ iz@@ ations of the dose may require several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the Tal@@ ents do not exceed 20 ng / ml levels . &quot;
in clinical practice the Tal@@ mud coverage of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time according to liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent detection of liver , kidney , and cardi@@ ac transpl@@ ants were used in the range of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has resulted in serious adverse events , including transpl@@ ants , or other side effects , which can appear in a succession of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; calculation of formulation or regime should only be carried out under the nar@@ row@@ ful control of a medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ ant sho@@ ck@@ proof that proved to be re@@ frac@@ tory compared to other immun@@ os@@ kel@@ y@@ va , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation . &quot;
&quot; for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ ant transpl@@ ants in adult heart transpl@@ ant recei@@ vers and transpl@@ ants in the child age , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of ad@@ den@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a lowering of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the consumption of herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ he@@ eds ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be found , or other plant enh@@ ancers , during treatment with ad@@ den@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us concentrations have been offered in the blood , as the T@@ AC@@ lim@@ us blood level can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f could be observed as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which therefore may also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; further factors which increase the risk of such a clinical disturb@@ ances , such an existing heart disease suffer , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; like with other immun@@ os@@ kel@@ y@@ va , the interaction of sunlight or UV light should be restricted to suitable clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients suffering from T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for such as headache , changes of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and vision problems , should have a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf &apos;s hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lact@@ ose , is very careful in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ osis @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable heal@@ ers , which are known as a inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing blood values of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels should be able to monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism to monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a highly distinctive interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies reported that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the inhibit@@ ing of gastro@@ intestinal disorders . &quot;
highly do@@ si@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on how it is used to increase or lower the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
&quot; impact of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us with drugs that are met@@ abolic through CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abolic who can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us limit the cle@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive , thereby reducing hormone exposure , is particularly careful with decisions on recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and their half @-@ time period can extend .
&quot; the results of a minor number of tests on transpl@@ ants of transpl@@ ants provide no indication that under T@@ AC@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ kel@@ y@@ va , increased risk of un@@ wanted events with regard to the course and the results of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns to any other adverse effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( especially concerning its effect on the kidneys ) is recommended . &quot;

it has been reported for ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ m including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative disease and skin tum@@ ours in combination with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can &apos;t be di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; mode of action and the dynamic effects on the molecular level , the effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be con@@ veys by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um inhibit@@ or of signal transfer due to T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a particular series of lymp@@ ho@@ kin gen@@ res .

lung transpl@@ antation In a intermediate analysis over a recent analysis conducted by oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported on 110 patients receiving either T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a 1 : 1 portion .
&quot; in the first year after transpl@@ antation , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) in the first year . &quot;

the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and after reaching the targeted lifting level of 8 to 15 ng / ml per 5 .
&quot; intestinal transpl@@ ant published clinical results of a mono@@ centr@@ ic study with oral pro@@ gra@@ y@@ cles in 155 patients ( 65 only intestinal , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 multi @-@ vis@@ cer@@ al transpl@@ ants ) among T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ an increased survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ atic value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or an increase by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are supposed to be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance payments . &quot;
&quot; this makes it close to that T@@ AC@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ ed in front of the ex@@ cre@@ tion , and the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly takes place over the G@@ alle . &quot;
&quot; for stable patients suffering from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( once daily ) at 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;

adv@@ ances will be used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII ) .
&quot; the dosage and frequency of the application will be addressed , whether adv@@ ances for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures is applied . &quot;
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII defect , causing hem@@ or@@ atory problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method used as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human being factor VIII .
&quot; adv@@ ances is a different drug in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but is otherwise produced , so the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated by preventing bleeding and surgical interventions . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ sis was honoured with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; well &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ances must not be applied in patients , possibly excessive ( allergic ) against human barley factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a approval for the transport of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
dosage : dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ defect , after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; at the following ug@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma bars ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is passed by the patient .
&quot; during treatment , the in@@ adequate dosage and frequency of injec@@ tions indicate the appropriate determination of factor VIII @-@ plasma bars . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery , and different half @-@ times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ sts will not be achieved or if the bleeding is not ruled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out , in order to im@@ pose an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed . &quot;
&quot; according to the patient , the administration rate should not be exceeded , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always referred to against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII based on Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that is quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ positions in the largest and genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 extru@@ sion and an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , after conversion of a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another that is observed re@@ occur ( appropri@@ ated ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences concerning the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lact@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s used for the greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who have enrolled higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on basis of available data will not be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) The in@@ a@@ waited waste of blood pressure factor VIII ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under contin@@ ous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
&quot; during the whole period , the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation was maintained during the whole time and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 . postoperative day . &quot;

&quot; in addition to any of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy up to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was observed ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients for inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contamination proteins were analysed by the analysis of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell @-@ protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms referred to in an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and elevated number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ocy@@ tes were reported in several repet@@ itive product positions in the context of the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the first installed data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be assessed as a positive rating , but considered positive , however , the safety profile for the following reasons must be closely monitored : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided that the authorisation for authorisation has to be applied for 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited sent the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) officially assumed that the company receives its request for the in@@ transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the crossover components ( tissues , which links other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and bases ) of it . &quot;
&quot; this is a kind of virus , which was genetically modified , that it can bear a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been modified that there is no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections can trigger the people . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors and to form the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced from which is not defective in the human body &apos;s existing p@@ 53 gene , usually bears the restoration of damaged DNA and kill the cells , if the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study using a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ sid@@ y , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers to the questions presented , there were still some questions . &quot;
&quot; based on the testing of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP submitted a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
the CH@@ MP opinion has not been demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for patients .
&quot; further concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company won the CH@@ MP , not knowing whether the retro@@ spec@@ tion consequences for patients who currently has been involved in clinical trials , or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changed mode of effectiveness &quot; means that the tablets are so composed so that one of the effective components can immediately be released , and the other slowly released a few hours . &quot;

&quot; in adults and adolescents over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the treatment duration should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are turned . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be followed by the sti@@ p@@ ation .
the main effective measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ p symptoms that were reported from the patient before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours a diary and rated with a standard scale as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
&quot; in consideration of all the hypo@@ cr@@ ust symptoms , the patient reported that the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze income , reported about a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who alone was pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients below Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % to 26.@@ 7 % compared to patients who have Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ers ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , oral dry , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( hypo@@ critical ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , ti@@ redness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ op@@ tics may not be applied in patients that possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different drug for treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not used . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied in patients that suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased water pressure ) , ur@@ inary or v@@ ascular disease including hypertension ( hypertension ) or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( hypertension ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stro@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company to grant approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet may be taken with a glass of water , but it is necessary to swal@@ low ( i.e. without being torn or che@@ w ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the absence of data to the un@@ think@@ able and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , it should not be applied in children under 12 years . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after removing the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can take the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin with time . &quot;
&quot; after reducing the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper air@@ ways , treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; when Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ xide oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combin@@ ating P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors like Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ cket , Per@@ go@@ vern , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ drin , oxy@@ gen@@ olin , n@@ haz@@ olin , and n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment at the occurr@@ ence of a hypertension or t@@ ach@@ ometer , heart rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache , or a rein@@ forcement of heada@@ ches ) must be dis@@ continued . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ic patients ) patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder extraction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ a in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , anti@@ hist@@ amine may prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin transactions or to reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , however , no clinical relevant inter@@ actions or changes of plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and placebo were detected , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ convenience of use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increasing the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency in normal population . &quot;
&quot; as reproductive studies in animals are not always transferred to humans , and based on the v@@ ascular properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be explained that in very rare cases it can come to a ligh@@ the@@ ness that can lead to a impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , tre@@ ads , vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , frigh@@ tening mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ y , nausea , vomiting , cor@@ p@@ ation , nausea , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision and hyper@@ ton@@ ia or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially likely in children , as well as ap@@ trop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and - dil@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ics / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of the adhes@@ ion cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring capacities including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective beats or the tasks that are associated with flying . &quot;
clinical trials was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause another sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ing , or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS @-@ exc@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined by the overall co@@ res for the symp@@ tom@@ atic symptoms ( except nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ til@@ isation ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in relation to the ab@@ duc@@ ing effect , determines from the nose s@@ mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ ation , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin on the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic multi @-@ dos@@ ing study , which was carried out as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , that four subjects disin@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was badly damaged . &quot;
a component inter@@ act study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was the exposure to the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in a repeat@@ able gift , for Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and Re@@ frac@@ tion@@ x@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not recognize any particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; the combination possessed no larger tox@@ icity as their individual components , and the effects observed in general in connection with the ingredient p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin . &quot;
&quot; in reprodu@@ cible studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic to rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;
March 2007 and module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation described pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ amine contribute to the treatment of allergic symptoms by preventing that hist@@ amine , a body @-@ own substance , can develop its effect . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets lin@@ ders symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) , like ni@@ esen , running or it@@ ching nose and wat@@ ering eyes with simultaneous con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases are diagnosed or diagnosed in your application : • hypertension • Herz@@ ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations • cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea and headache , or a rein@@ forcement of existing heada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; when taking Aer@@ in@@ aze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
transport and handling of machines At the recommended dosage is not to calculate that Aer@@ in@@ aze leads to drow@@ sin@@ ess or healing the attention .
&quot; if you have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze , as you should , you should immediately have your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the taking of Aer@@ in@@ gens , if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible , and turn the next dose to the designated point . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects are considerably imp@@ aired or you notice side effects , which are not specified in this manual formation . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was very rare about cases of severe allergic reactions ( air@@ less , whi@@ st@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching and swelling ) or rash . &quot;
&quot; over cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach problems , diarrhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , dizziness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sei@@ z@@ ure , muscle pain , sei@@ zu@@ res , sei@@ z@@ ure of cases of liver disease and more cases of remarkable liver values were also very rare . &quot;
&quot; it is as a 5 m@@ g. tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophi@@ hil@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for entries . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children ages 6 to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients , which also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ron , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were submitted to indicate that the body weight the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and melt the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and application of children are un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symp@@ tom@@ score ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ erial 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo .
&quot; A@@ erial may not be applied in patients , possibly excessive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company to grant approval for the transport of A@@ erial in the entire European Union . &quot;
one tablet once daily with one or without a meal to relie@@ ve the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for the effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the previous disease and can be resum@@ ed after the sound of symptoms and re@@ occur in their re @-@ occur .
the persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended for the patient during the everyday life of continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets even in which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol has not increased the effective effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be explained that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ erial , when patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common secondary effect of heada@@ ches were treated at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study that were given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ics / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the expression of the expression of the adhes@@ ion cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multi @-@ outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dos@@ ing of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant kar@@ di@@ ovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was given over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring capacities including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective beats or the tasks that are associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the reduction of symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ zing allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the quality of life of the quality of life of the life of the life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investig@@ ating for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology resem@@ bles the underlying path@@ ology in the different forms and chronic patients will be a simple pro@@ spective . &quot;
&quot; because the hist@@ amine release is a major factor in all ur@@ ari@@ an@@ ari@@ al diseases , however , that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who also leads to other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ erial was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the suspension of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; like in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine were excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale on evaluation of these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;
there are no evidence points for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dos@@ ing of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty acids , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) do not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin , at a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in a repeat@@ able gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for re@@ frac@@ tion@@ x@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will not recognize any special dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; color film ( contains l@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ate , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indig@@ oc@@ ar@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , far@@ bl@@ os@@ er film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , Car@@ nau@@ ba wax , and light wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , for reli@@ eving the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years can be caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are proposed to support treatment of inf@@ ective rhin@@ itis with A@@ erial .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical tests and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be restricted and experienced a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which restri@@ cts met@@ abolic , is identical with the children who are normal met@@ ering . &quot;
this drug contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or a suc@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug do not take . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ erial tablets even in which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ erial tablets and alcohol has not increased the effective effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ erial . patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment in question , received a daily disaster dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant kar@@ di@@ ovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ alls . &quot;
clinical trials was found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents not increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to placebo .
&quot; in an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ erial tablets were in adults and adolescents in clinical trials for no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was neither an increase of alcohol @-@ induced power @-@ induced power relations even to an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in combination of symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ fication and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall quality of life of the quality of life of the life of the life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets was effectively produced by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ erial was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the suspension of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
the prolifer@@ ation of this restricted met@@ abolic syndrome was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults and 16 % children ) than in Caucas@@ ia ( 2 % adults and 3 % children ) .
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup forms of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which is fully met@@ abolic . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ time period of about 120 hours .
there are no evidence points for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not determined in clinical trials with A@@ erial tablets even in which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ erial tablets , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose trials , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vit@@ al@@ signs and EC@@ G intervals . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially declared that the company receives its request for approval for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect influenza which is caused by the stem ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a strain of the influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus appears easily , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system contained the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system was later capable of forming a grip with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this tri@@ cky antibody . &quot;
&quot; the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , were cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not performed according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of clinical data base for the assessment of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA funding rules for prehistoric vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical study and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your treated doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you wish further information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , which are infected with human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic ase can be taken as a solution for entry , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; it should then be classified only if the doctor has examined , which has taken an@@ tivir@@ al pharmac@@ euticals from the patient before , and the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood has judged that the virus is to talk to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice a day , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ generators to the body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in taking with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV cells in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS is not cure , however , the cran@@ ial of the immune system , and thus , can also cause the development of infection with HIV and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; with low do@@ si@@ zing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ generators was compared with 206 adults , previously compared prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
main inde@@ struc@@ table for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks under A@@ generated more patients a viral load below 400 copies / ml was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , that with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ generators the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a more powerful waste of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generators ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhoea ( diarrhea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , rash and f@@ ences ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients , possibly excessive ( allergic ) against am@@ us@@ avi@@ r , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ he@@ eds ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are dis@@ rup@@ ted as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the risk of cy@@ c@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis ( symptoms of bone tissue ) , or an immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the re@@ treated immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ generators in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of NSC @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children aged over four years compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee presented that the benefits of acid in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved , as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a approval for the transport of A@@ generators in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , an@@ ol@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic boo@@ sted by am@@ o@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r should be taken into consideration the individual viral resistance and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % lower than from Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore are A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for acid capsules is 600 mg of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generated capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ p@@ adding ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules is 20 mg of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ eb@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , the dose of infected capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver function at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or moderate liver function , with patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medication , which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements containing Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to the cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with aspir@@ ation , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV on others by sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for usually , an@@ generic capsules are supposed to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , have increased risk of severe liver problems with potentially fatal disease . &quot;
&quot; for the case of a simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with existing restricted liver function including a chron@@ ically @-@ active Hepatitis show a increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ ocular co@@ ids are not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment of the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the @-@ ni@@ otic function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 because of the elevated risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen not recommended .
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma bars ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive may be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored on ob@@ pi@@ atic symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ ane type of tox@@ icity , this formulation is contra@@ indicated for children under an age of four years , and should be applied to caution with certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an existing type of diabetes mell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases associated with medication related to developing a diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with met@@ abolic disorders associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; in ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease , reports are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ inflammatory reaction ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction on asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi @-@ factor e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy body mass index , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width incre@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medication that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generators containing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medication which are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma bars with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r who can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and may lead to a resistance development .
&quot; in trying to compens@@ ate with a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r inhibit@@ ors , very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
cur@@ d@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be harvested by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already occupies Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ on@@ av@@ irus level and , if possible , check the vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ b wort . &quot;
a dose custom@@ ization for one of the drug is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ min@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max de@@ hydr@@ ated by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ perf@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and in@@ convenience of this therapeutic schem@@ atic . &quot;
52 % hum@@ ili@@ ated if Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached by am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it will not be recommended that it is not known as the effectiveness and in@@ convenience of this combination . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , but due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ it@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is not required . &quot;
treatment with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be serious .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin reduces the serum concentration of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r possibly .
&quot; if this medicine should be used simultaneously , caution is recommended because del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma bars . &quot;
&quot; if this medicine will be used together , caution is recommended ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as an exact forecast of the effect of combination of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in resulted in a rise of plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ ode@@ ut@@ in at 193 % and thus to a rise in associated side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ ul@@ in is advised together with A@@ generic ase , is recommended to reduce the dosage of rift in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is present . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with A@@ generators in combination with Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma bars of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increasing the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below are also sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ generators , possibly lead to inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are related to these medicines , when they are applied in combination with an@@ tic@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ it@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it may come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower plasma level of am@@ perf@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ cl@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ cl@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ is@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through am@@ us@@ avi@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake of in@@ verter can increase their plasma concentrations , and increase effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ apes , vision problems and pri@@ ap@@ hor@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % account interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ ther@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ effici@@ ents , unless the potential benefit of a treatment of the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which varies from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive increases of plasma bars when simultaneous administration . &quot;
&quot; as plasma cutting increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as far as stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous gift of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generic ase may not be applied together with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is provided . &quot;
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma bar by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 @-@ thread .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given together with Am@@ us@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored on ob@@ pi@@ atic symptoms , especially if there are also low doses to be administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low limitation of historical compar@@ isons , there are currently no recommendation to adapt as the am@@ us@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ generators , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a reduction or gain of the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods to contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous gift of ag@@ gregate ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied to care for the mother in comparison to the possible risks in the fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk l@@ activated rats , Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ us@@ avi@@ r survived in human breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive study on dre@@ am@@ ental rats that was administered by the income in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding time Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight in the after@@ math . &quot;
further development of the comments including Fer@@ tility and Re@@ duction ability was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in adults and children aged 4 years , clinical trials were examined in clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; most of the effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment effects were slightly until moderate , coming up early and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether it can be used in connection with in@@ gest@@ ion or another at the same time to the HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the grass disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were used by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were listed in more than 1 % of the patients receiving treatment changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of protein and fa@@ der fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation ( Sti@@ cker ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ t @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium length of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study conducted at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients under Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin suggestions were usually slightly until moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared during the second treatment week and disappeared within two weeks without leaving the treatment with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r had to be broken . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ inflammatory reaction ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction on asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI previously treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase had been observed twice daily with low do@@ si@@ zing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and lab changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and lab changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and lab changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , who received treatment with low do@@ si@@ zing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequent . &quot;
&quot; in case of overdose , the patient is observed to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ icated ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;

inver@@ sely ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early sl@@ ump of a disp@@ atch therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which can affect the following treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , with PI ( 600 mg twice daily ) and with a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with an PI , mainly with the lowest Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ g . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared with A@@ generators , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the Study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis proved the non @-@ under@@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ base wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the efficacy of un@@ allocated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase has been taken twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ zed p@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
&quot; after 48 weeks of the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 bases on this data should be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) , which leaves am@@ us@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the overall concentration in plasma , with the amount of incomplete am@@ us@@ avi@@ r which represents the active proportion , probably unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ us@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active present is fluctu@@ ated in the ste@@ ady drugs in the ste@@ ady state in the ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmac@@ euticals , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can be given to be given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of acid capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is a solution of 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ generated capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar base . &quot;
the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible and therefore the impact of a ren@@ al disorder on the elimination of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatments lead to am@@ us@@ avi@@ r plasma organs comparable to those who are generated in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats came up with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ perf@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the gen@@ o@@ cellular Aden@@ omes and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , a little evidence for the assumption of clinical relevance of these findings were made from the present position data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , containing bacteria @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro @-@ core test in rats and chromosome test , was Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r neither suspected nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven by AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in clinical trials , neither during administration of A@@ generators even after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in young , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed both at the control and also among the animals and also with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mortality . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposure that was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and low skel@@ eton changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If a@@ wning capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ p@@ adding ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules is 20 mg of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ eb@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application should be treated with weak or lighter liver function disorder with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of cy@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r who can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and may lead to a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max de@@ hydr@@ ated by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached by am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ o@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it will not be recommended that it is not known as the effectiveness and in@@ convenience of this combination . &quot;
treatment with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be serious .
&quot; if this medicine will be used together , caution is recommended ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as an exact forecast of the effect of combination of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ ul@@ in is advised together with A@@ generic ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of rift in at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data is present . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ cl@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ cl@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ is@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ us@@ avi@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % account interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ generators , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended due to the possibility of a reduction or gain of the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be used in pregnancy during pregnancy for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fo@@ etus .
&quot; a reproductive study on dre@@ am@@ ental rats that was administered by the income in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding time Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight in the after@@ math . &quot;
&quot; in adults and children aged 4 years , clinical trials were examined in clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in case of overdose , the patient is observed to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ icated ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood cells . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r is found in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
inver@@ sely ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; based on these data , treatment optim@@ isation should be considered to be considered to be considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ dealt oo@@ ster &quot; aging &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ us@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active present is fluctu@@ ated in the ste@@ ady drugs in the ste@@ ady state in the ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;

&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in young , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed both at the control and also among the animals and also with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mortality . &quot;

the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ generated solution for inclusion was not included with PI previously treated patients with PI .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % lower than from Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore are A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ ther@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ o@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg am@@ us@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no Dos@@ age recommendation for simultaneous application of as@@ generic solution to intake and low do@@ si@@ der Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patient groups are avoided . &quot;

&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ lic acid content , a generic solution for children and children under 4 years , pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competent inhibit@@ ing of this medicine and may cause serious and / or threatening side effects like heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to the cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ generic ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV on others by sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;

&quot; the cream is dil@@ uted in front of bed@@ time on the affected skin surfaces , so that they remain in the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before being washed . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the main inde@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with full heat treatment . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either per week or five times a week . &quot;
main inde@@ struc@@ table for the effectiveness was the number of patients with full healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • For the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete breakdown rate in all four main studies ranged from 66 % to 80 % in patients with Al@@ dar@@ a patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the scope of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream is so long continued until all the visible F@@ eig@@ n in the Gen@@ ital@@ - or Peri@@ od area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ ruption in the above treatment process should be weighed , if intense local inflammation occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when treatment is observed in the treatment area . &quot;
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the untreated les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient used the cream as soon as he noticed this and then proceed with the usual treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream is dil@@ uted in a thin layer , rub in a smoked skin range until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
it should be carried out in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and with a possible contamination of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should be a reduction in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk of organ@@ omet@@ ri@@ fication or gra@@ ft versus @-@ host@@ - reaction risk .
&quot; in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ ori@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is were observed and a case with one of the circumcision is observed . &quot;
&quot; in a case of use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of severe skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed , which caused a treatment required and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing the water that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous products for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ n in the genital tract and Peri@@ od range , no clinical experiences yet exist . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest to increased rate of f@@ eig@@ ning reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown in this patient group in relation to the elimination of f@@ eig@@ n however a smaller efficacy . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm , around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or hair set was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin transactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take back in general during therapy , or reactions after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or for the sever@@ ity of local skin transactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed following the re@@ generating of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be considered in super@@ fi@@ provincial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are no clinical experiences yet , therefore , the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) is a smaller li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of contact on the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears , or on the lip@@ tic area within the lip@@ en@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses of anatom@@ ic places outside the facial and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis on the poor and hands support the effectiveness in this application function , therefore , such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin transactions are frequent , but these reactions usually take back in the course of the therapy to intensity or leave the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin actions in the patient cause a big dis@@ comfort , or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 files les@@ ions have a lower rate of healing than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream should be applied to patients who receive a immune to immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ ial development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;

the most commonly shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in relation @-@ related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions to the place of the treatment of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
&quot; the most frequently reported and probably , as probably , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in the context of side effects include complaints at the application resort with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
the bas@@ ali@@ om patients from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ treated patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III side effects were presented below .
&quot; the most common , probably , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in connection , were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ic patients ) . &quot;
&quot; adverse reactions , which were treated by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; according to exam@@ ining clinical trials , these clinical signs indicate that this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream frequently revealed to local skin actions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / retri@@ eval ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to exam@@ ining clinical trials , these studies shows that these studies ranged from five times a weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream very often to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe gra@@ vit@@ ation and c@@ res@@ ation ( 19 % ) . &quot;
clinical studies on investig@@ ating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the accid@@ ental unique oral recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gies and fever . &quot;
the clin@@ ically severe side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized themselves after or@@ phic or intraven@@ ous fluid .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study , the concentration of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine were detected at an increasing systemic concentrations of the Alpha@@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es . &quot;
in 3 permissible @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete distribution of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ od treatment in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
&quot; at 60 % of the total of 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and patients heal the F@@ eig@@ n complete , this was in 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a full healing allocation could be achieved at 23 % from 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five @-@ time application per week for 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; the target cav@@ ities were hist@@ ologically , individual primary super@@ fi@@ able bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot;
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled study study after four years present data shows that roughly 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically used for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine during three weeks in one or two treatment time ranges from 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;

the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum systemic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed in between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0,2 and 1,6 ng / ml when using the scal@@ p ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time period after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; it indicates an extended re@@ tention of the drug in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine according to top@@ ical application on MC @-@ induced skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ able bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the rat @-@ bearing doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg , a significantly reduced body weight and elevated sp@@ leen weight ; another four @-@ month study showed no similar effects during the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year @-@ old study on carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at der@@ mal@@ er administration was induced in three days a week .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ agen , is a risk of people based on systemic exposure because of systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice that was treated with the effective cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by reducing its effect in relation to the reduction of the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and related to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; for children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me increased the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children ended up a normal liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , chest pain , pain in the lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ der ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients , possibly strongly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) . &quot;

treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary metabolism .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any conc@@ up@@ side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be eng@@ ined , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the recovery devices for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies available immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution by using Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; in case of light or medium @-@ severe in@@ fu@@ sions , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate on half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion conditional reaction must be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fusion may be taken again with reducing the in@@ fusion rate in 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction has occurred . &quot;
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments have not been committed to direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated opposite the breast milk over the breast milk is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not too quiet . &quot;
&quot; adverse reactions in clinical trials were observed mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study were observed under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
un@@ wanted drug actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during the phase 3 study and an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS I @-@ related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the previous history , severe reactions came out , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory tra@@ verse and facial expressions ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe circulation form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment of a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , whereby it occurred in the patients at the age of 5 with a severe delay time ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) were treated with 13 / 45 patients suffering from radio@@ immun@@ op@@ positions ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay demonstr@@ able antibodies , among them 3 patients , where it never came to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
patients with lack of anti @-@ antibodies levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n while patients with high antibody tit@@ bits a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n was found .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ g@@ inal until low neutr@@ alising the effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to not affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted drug actions , even if the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted drug actions typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies . &quot;
the grounds for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and preventing an additional accumulation of enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
although patients were recruited for the study to recru@@ it all the disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient proved the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a for@@ c@@ eded exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage of the percentage of FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
&quot; all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me treated patients on the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table . &quot;
in the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage of the percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant in this period and the absolute lung capacity increased further proportional to the body @-@ size of children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hepat@@ ocy@@ tic treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients receiving a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes summar@@ ised for five efficacy variable ( to expect the percentage of percentage points ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
there was a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study carried out mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe failure form and 4 with the middle b@@ ays form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in Har@@ n in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; for several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) has been found after the Z score for this age group The younger patients with severe failure form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe failure to determine only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , investigations into the dynamic impact of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ atics were performed on the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , an represented alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will give any new information that are available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug can be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile of patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in unique gifts , tox@@ icity in repeated gift and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data allow no specific dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no toler@@ ability studies were carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except with the 6 . 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ ready @-@ ready preparation is not used immediately , this is not longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , unless the dil@@ uted under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions were carried out . &quot;

&quot; this register is treated in the longer term safety and efficacy information about patients that were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data for the natural progression of the disease in patients without these treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients that suffer from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( Gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in low quantity or that enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( ins@@ ens@@ itive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is each side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are using medicines , the chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
references to handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution has to be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical specialist personnel ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is able to increase every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; however , in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - Con@@ sci@@ ous participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs , severe reactions came up , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory tra@@ verse and face of face . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( occurr@@ ence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • heada@@ ches • nausea • abdominal pain • rash , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • hei@@ gh@@ ted • fever • ch@@ ills • increased pulse • hyper@@ ton@@ ia • less oxygen in the blood • reaction at the in@@ fusion &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every new information that will be available annually , and if required , the package may be updated . &quot;

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( a different drug against cancer ) if the cancer is not re@@ se@@ eable ( medicines for cancer ) and is probably easily spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer who does not attack the epithel@@ ium cells .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who previously had not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as a few therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , the patient should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( vitamin ) and obtain injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , they should be given an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drugs against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid level ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood is changed , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be lowered or reduced the dose . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form goes lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer response time in cancer cells . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further drug against cancer ) both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were treated at an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
&quot; patients who had previously received chemotherapy had previously been treated with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months in Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients , in which the cancer did not strike the record epithel@@ ium , at the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta extended survival times than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each tile bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
&quot; the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ or sis will be taken from perme@@ able water and dil@@ uted with 0,9 % sodium chloride solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in shown on the first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for over@@ flowing disc epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic @-@ cell bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for a proven drive epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after graduation from P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F was administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment .
&quot; at reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin actions a day before and on the day of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ administration , as well as per day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as in every third place .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should be created before each gift a complete blood pattern , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anine Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose test must be held under the rec@@ eding of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous treatment . &quot;
&quot; according to recovery , patients must be treated according to the notes in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA to the patient &apos;s value before the treatment &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients after 2 dose reductions or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurr@@ ence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or compared to patients at the age of 65 an increased side risk is made .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data to the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not require dose custom@@ iz@@ ations required for all patients recommended dose adjustments . &quot;
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function estimate of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or tran@@ sam@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver ab@@ normal@@ ities ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver ab@@ outs ) are not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
patients must be supervised and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients prior to whose absolute neutr@@ alised number is again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - Cy@@ cles has again achieved a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadi@@ r of the absolute neutral count , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a smaller tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia has been de@@ emed when a pre @-@ treatment had taken place with folic acid and vitamin B12 .
&quot; therefore , all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ ted patients have to be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ esy @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ one@@ tic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ actic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients who are intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is necessary to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation , a drainage of the eff@@ usion of the flow before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment can be weighed . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardi@@ ov@@ arian events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of the same application is not recommended ( excluding yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shafts of the reproductive @-@ ability due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , males should be pointed out prior to treatment , advice regarding the sperm cells . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ one@@ tic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g per day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dose of adverse events . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high dosage . &quot;
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction , 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data regarding the inter@@ shareholder as with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be prevented for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the disease status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires a increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation .
&quot; there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as at an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected to be severe birth defects . &quot;
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed can not be applied during pregnancy unless necessary when demanding and after careful breakdown of the use@@ fulness for the mother and risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shafts of the reproductive @-@ ability due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , males should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment , advice concerning the sperm cells . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in the breast milk , and un@@ wanted effects when used infants can &apos;t be excluded . &quot;
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ end@@ othel@@ ial and were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 163 patients with mes@@ end@@ othel@@ ial were random@@ ized to random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in than mon@@ otherapy .

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ l@@ astic anti@@ fol@@ ate that explo@@ ded its effect by interrup@@ ting the process @-@ dependent met@@ abolic processes that are necessary for the cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several attack points ( TS ) , di@@ hydro@@ fol@@ ate reduction ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , di@@ hydro@@ fol@@ ate reduction ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , di@@ hydro@@ fol@@ ate reduction ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cine synthesis of thy@@ me and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving treatment arms ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement of clinical relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ et was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole of C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of lung functional parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in control arm .
&quot; a multic@@ enter , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and from 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;

&quot; patients who can occupy all@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they can not build some fats in the food , thereby reducing such a quarter of the diet added un@@ d@@ aut the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies on patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had all@@ i 60 mg , after one year an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with all@@ i patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , there was no problem for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair crisis , chair , fet@@ ch / o@@ ily stool , finish o@@ ily stre@@ et@@ c@@ tur@@ rets ( threads ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be applied in patients that are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the transpl@@ antation of transpl@@ ant patients ) or drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must not be applied to patients who are absorbed in a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to Chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) suffer from pregnant or lact@@ ating mothers .
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a approval for the transport of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is designed for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in connection with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine @-@ fet@@ al diet .
all@@ i may not be applied to children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data for effectiveness and safety .
&quot; however , Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ated , is not necessary for ageing and / or kidney function in patients with restricted liver and / or kidney function . &quot;

the probability of occurr@@ ence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase when all@@ i is taken along with a fat @-@ rich meal or low @-@ fat nutrition .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be observed with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients who should consult a doctor with all@@ i to consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dose of anti@@ diabe@@ tic controls must be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for hypertension or increased cholesterol levels , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dos@@ ing of this drug needs to be adjusted . &quot;
it is recommended to meet additional swelling measures to prevent the oral contra@@ cep@@ tion in the case of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; both in a study for inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a decrease of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bars was observed . &quot;
&quot; in combination of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ ative ratio , IN@@ R ) might be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as beta @-@ car@@ otene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vitality treatment ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of one disposable dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed at a limited number of volunteer volunteers , which at the same time or@@ list@@ at received a lower decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and hang up with pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , because the absorption of recorded fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequencies based on available data will not be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of known side effects , which were detected after the market introduction of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size . &quot;
&quot; † It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may result in relation to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
&quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ outlets from up to 400 mg three times daily , over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects were given , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of reported cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ do@@ zation , either side effects or similar effects were reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on human studies on humans and animal , from a rapid recovery of the systemic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ cal properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect reli@@ es on the l@@ umen of the stomach and the top d@@ n@@ dar@@ ms by kov@@ al ties to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ kre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical studies were derived from clinical trials that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , is blocked by the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ ts . &quot;

&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been rated as follows : as change of body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as a share of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;

the most common side effects depend on the action of the capsules together and thus arise that the fat is eliminated from the body .
&quot; these side effects occur usually within the first weeks after the start of treatment , as you may not have reduced the fat percentage in diet may not yet be reduced consistently . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ize the nutrition @-@ related accompan@@ iment : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better one week before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ al food . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite food and over the size of the portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood decreases that you do not exceed your fat limit . • share your recommended fatty amount evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , do not take care of it in the form of a low @-@ range main court or a busy night@@ stand , how you may have to appear in other programs for weight loss . • Most people in which these accompanying tasks occur , learn this with the time by adjust@@ ing their diet . &quot;

&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example due to improving the diet and more movement , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals , which contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to nour@@ ish and feed permanently . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in Kil@@ o@@ j@@ oule , which you can also find as indication on the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake , how many calories should take up to a maximum per day . &quot;
&quot; note the further below in this section below tables . • The recommended grease supply in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with each meal . &quot;
&quot; which quantity is suitable for you , take the below information that is suitable for you , which is suitable for you . • Because of the capsule of the capsule is crucial for you . &quot;
&quot; if you have the same amount of fat like so far , it can mean that your body can &apos;t handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; due to the recommended grease supply , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and reduce the probability for nutrition @-@ related accompanying support . • You should try to decrease gradually and continuously . &quot;
34 This dimin@@ ished cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight and lose weight of approximately 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Ger@@ inge physical activity &quot; means that you do not burn a little or even if you go through movement daily 150 kcal , e.g. through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to put the realistic cal@@ ori@@ - and fat targets and maintain this too . • T@@ ry to move a nutrition journal with information about calcium and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program for the support of weight loss combines the capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of further information materials that can help you to feed , cal@@ ori@@ ents , and fet@@ ters , to be physically active . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting are ( like c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an antibody .
&quot; the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , as to the effects in this age group do not have enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the substance avo@@ ids the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are severe or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; when chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers of nausea and vomiting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; with chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted to Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi across the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and vomiting in moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one of the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ nesses , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is recommended for simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or tend to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; unless in connection with another chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used in the days after the treatment of nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not stim@@ ulate the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady static concentration of met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ess , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences on application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary for the doctor &apos;s treated doctor . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observ@@ able side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of survival actions and reactions at the administration site ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar frequencies of un@@ wanted events such as in other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose of action relations . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , however , due to the large distribution volume , however , is probably no effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ do@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cy@@ c@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 of d@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of d@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of d@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ i@@ ason intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received with patients receiving 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were given up to day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate @-@ based chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication @-@ induced chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron based on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the evidence of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block at the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ onic channels and extend the duration of the promotional potential . &quot;
&quot; the objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. of real Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses ranging from 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations , a slow elimination of elimination of the body with an average termin@@ al half time of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately propor@@ tion@@ ately in the entire range of dose of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses taken at 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ carcin@@ oma patient between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations , that at once a daily intraven@@ ous rate of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was measured at 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg , however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ time period of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % of the kidneys have been eliminated , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabolism , which have been compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abolic have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changeable drug made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a single intraven@@ ous bolt in but@@ ary the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients with severe liver function patients are increased in patients with severe liver function and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , only after ex@@ positions were observed , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ ist exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 Out of clinical trials revealed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which can extend at the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ mic and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ) said in about the 30@@ 000 of the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ating frequency of liver tum@@ ours , hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , pancre@@ as , tri@@ chlor@@ ophyll , pancre@@ as , tri@@ chlor@@ ophyll , pancre@@ as , minor mice , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and Alo@@ xi by humans used for unique application , the relevance of these results will be minimal . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C / ml injec@@ tion@@ ing solution . &quot;
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should be similar to the same in@@ dent@@ ist constitu@@ ent ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference ti@@ dings &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a viral infection of liver disease ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic investigation , the liver tissue damage caused damage , also the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast which has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the drug .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on presented data , which indicate the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( effect structure , composition , and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;

&quot; apart from that , the test was used in the study to investigate how the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficient . &quot;
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cruci@@ sten@@ ing formation of skin infection ) and small in@@ infected in@@ firm@@ ities ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pping ) ; smooth@@ ing and se@@ wn wounds .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go is not used to treat infections , which have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because the alarm against this kind of infections may not be . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from nine months , but patients under 18 years old may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not speaking after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle produced in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main inde@@ struc@@ tions of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients who had taken infection after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients were enrolled in the treatment .
&quot; during the treatment of infected hood , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in were similar contact : when the results of both studies were taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of those two groups were treated to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , NSC 631570 was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is caused by the treatment of aby@@ ss ( ground @-@ filled cav@@ ities in body tissues ) or of infection that have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation in the contract .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go was over the short @-@ time treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections across the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ities , pur@@ ification or paraly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the transport network of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with which no improvement within two to three days are supposed to be considered even once and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of a sen@@ si@@ bil@@ isation or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment was canc@@ eled carefully and the appropriate alternative therapy to the infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen or is presum@@ ed ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary in@@ jected wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant st@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) were in@@ sufficient . &quot;
&quot; alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place . &quot;
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means at the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been reached by human use after top@@ ical application , the clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure of top@@ ical application in patients , dose adap@@ t@@ ations are not required if top@@ ical retri@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction product after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate in terms of imp@@ lications for effects on the birth and the fat / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to be able to prevent systemic antibiot@@ ic surgery .
&quot; in the decision , whether the breast@@ feeding continued / ended or termin@@ ated with the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , is between the benefit of nursing and the benefit of al@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the administration site , which is about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of mode ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Con@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the re@@ mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding point of the 50s under@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes which differs from the bin@@ aries of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the Bin@@ ding In@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P engagement site and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
&quot; by binding at this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line block the pep@@ tide transfer , some P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local prevalence of resistance resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some of the infection forms should be thou@@ ght@@ ful , should consult a advice by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure on the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ cid@@ in ) should be considered . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults was raised 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under Oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and placed on the skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
&quot; the sampling was carried out in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients , before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application . &quot;
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after top@@ ical use of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 of the skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
met@@ abolic Met@@ abol@@ ism of retin@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily associated with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

&quot; there were neither male nor female rats at female rats signs of restricted fer@@ til@@ ity in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in a maximum exposure of exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) : &quot;

&quot; the holder of approval for the transport network must ensure that a pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ ator system , such as in module 1.@@ 8.1 , is present and works before the product is marketed as long as the product is marketed as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the transport network is obliged to perform closer detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical activities , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which have been agreed with CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Ac@@ inal Products for Human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted at the same time with the next perio@@ dic safety update Report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated spot , you should end the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other o@@ ars , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the area that is treated with al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly awarded by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth , or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;

ambient is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of an existing vaccine plan , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is allowed to only be used if immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the two doses of the vaccine can be led to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ h dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , ambient or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by using the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense of the body ) as it can resist a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine in Twin@@ rix adults and who has been approved since 1997 in Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given in the context of one of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because ambient and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults an identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main inde@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibodies .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
ambient resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature between ambient and a 12 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , App@@ et@@ it@@ man@@ gel , pain at the injection site , redness , matrix ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
ambient may not be applied in patients who may react to the active ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . among others , an approval for the transport network of Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire region &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose of choice and second dose administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her for Hepatitis A is requested as well as for Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination of a combination of vacc@@ ines . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ anti @-@ anti @-@ anti @-@ anti @-@ anti @-@ anti @-@ anti @-@ anti @-@ anti @-@ anti @-@ antibodies ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ gen values are in the same size as following vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not completely secure , whether immune competent individuals who have addressed on an Hepatitis A@@ - Imp@@ act , as they are also protected by immune memory , as they are also protected by the immune memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As in all injec@@ tions , for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring is always available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended , the 360 ELISA units formed form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and persons with disturb@@ ances of the immune system , under circumstances does not reach a sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ antibodies , so that in these cases the gift of further vaccination can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration may result in the glut@@ eal muscles to a sub@@ optimal impact result , these injection modes should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be in@@ jected without exception , as it can come to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in these cases . &quot;
&quot; if ambient in the second year of life , if ambi@@ rix was administered simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy , or in patients with immune defects , there may be no sufficient immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study that was conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , matrix , gastro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable with the frequency , which was observed in the previous thi@@ omer sal@@ e- and preserv@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to , including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination comp@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher Frequ@@ encies of Pain and Mat@@ ter@@ ity on a Comp@@ endium basis per vacc@@ ines , but not on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 9.1 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses combination . &quot;
&quot; after the entire vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had administered ambi@@ rix over a pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matrix was comparable high ( i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9,6 % of subjects , ambient ) compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of subjects that received the 3 @-@ doses combination . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of severe pain and matrix was low and comparable , that was observed after administration of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 years of imp@@ eller , the occurr@@ ence of local reactions and general transactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to the detection of hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; however , during the 6 to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , a frequent occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection site ) was reported per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of stimul@@ ants that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vaccination schem@@ as with ambient , using 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units of the combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B@@ - surface anti@@ gen , was not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials that were carried out in imp@@ ass@@ ingen at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV &apos;s 9@@ 9.1 % was one month after the first dose , and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ab@@ orted dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose , and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ab@@ orted dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparable study , which was carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination of three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was ext@@ end@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective Rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose imp@@ airs significantly higher than ambient . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. , month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vaccine were either a 2 @-@ bit vacc@@ ema with ambient and a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with a combination of 360 ELISA @-@ units with a combination of hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; persons who were at the time of the Grun@@ dig between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ antibodies were detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine . &quot;
&quot; this study observed immun@@ o@@ gens against both anti @-@ anti@@ gens , consisting of 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - to , including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ antibodies were comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination . &quot;
&quot; when the first dose of ambient in the second year of life was administered at the age of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial , which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ization rates as for the previous formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both pre @-@ examined and / or physical visible changes as well as after the res@@ us@@ ement .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as through Baden in the contam@@ inated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; like in all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect completely before an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child will not feel un@@ comfortable or ill at the vaccination time ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed .
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin rash , breath @-@ not or swelling of your face or the tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the use of the second vaccination ) . &quot;
&quot; in a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambient . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; the second vacc@@ inations of this vaccine is reduced with reduced content of effective stock , usually a month after the first dose , and is likely to give you a vaccination protection against the termination of the vaccine series . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , ambient in people suffer from heavy blood cells suffer from the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened in your body or a treatment in your / his body &apos;s body / or if you / your child are under@@ min@@ ed in a hem@@ og@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Do you take your doctor if you want to take another medicine ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated , or if you have been vacc@@ inated or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or that in the near future is planned . &quot;
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and the person is not against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated on separate places and different lim@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; if ambient is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , ambient or lact@@ ating women will not be given , except it is urg@@ ently needed to vacc@@ inated both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; based on the data , which has become known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the transport network , CH@@ MP joined the opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio is positive for Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; however , there is only one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) in circulation , the available safety data is limited to this medication based on low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in the history of ammon@@ ium .
ammon@@ ium is split - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed , under the food or over a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a nas@@ ens@@ ile ( by the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , because ammon@@ ium could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ medicine , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ium can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid re@@ spiration , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium is effective in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ ium values . &quot;
ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval is only limited information regarding this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients with which a complete enzyme gel has already manifested in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 Living age ) .
&quot; in patients with a late manifest@@ o ( in@@ complete enzyme defective , which is manifested after the first life of life ) , there is an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese exists a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with si@@ p disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually controlled by taking the protein tolerance and calcul@@ ates the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing less than 20 kg , as well as with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early defect at Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthetic or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sm@@ ur@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ c@@ cin@@ at@@ synthetic deficiency require arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given patients with si@@ p disorders as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets do not enter into the stomach .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , corresponding to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied to patients with con@@ ven@@ ed cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium rec@@ ess and o@@ dem@@ entia , in order to be applied only with caution . &quot;
&quot; as met@@ abolic and separation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate on young rats in high dose ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of the neur@@ onal inter@@ ruption and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of working nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is eliminated during human breast milk and for that reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) , and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not in connection with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lact@@ ate acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Panz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a case of overdose occurred at a 5 @-@ month old small child , with an accid@@ ental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go using the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in a intraven@@ ous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ ing lim@@ iting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound that con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ actic glut@@ amine that is eliminated by the kidneys .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ dium glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the removal of excess nitrogen .
&quot; 5 patients with disturb@@ ances of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed , that for each gram inserted sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ lic acid are produced . &quot;
&quot; it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early , and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival for survival and clinical outcome . &quot;
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early manifest@@ ation of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always infectious , and the disease resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their stu@@ ffy free analogue within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; due to ha@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , protein@@ ogenic K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase survival rate by post @-@ part@@ al ( however , within the first quarter of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose illness was diagnosed during the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with the time with many of mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest@@ ation of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ko@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were re@@ treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ ites are also hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients can occur further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phenol , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in wet healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to individual reproduction as well as repeated gifts of oral doses ranging from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gifts of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients suffering from ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , the following morning no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate was det@@ ectable in plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
separation The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h according to oral dos@@ ing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with si@@ p disorders ) or via an Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i or a Nas@@ ens@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a weight of weight over 20 kg , as well as with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ inine , amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early defect at Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthetic or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sm@@ ur@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , accordingly to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , corresponding to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat economist were exposed to the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ids of the brain cells . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lact@@ ate acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Panz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ dium glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess water
based on tests on the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with patients suffering from the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram inserted sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ ites are also hardly reversible , and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in granite form , 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this case contains a small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the big measuring sco@@ op 8.6 g So@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient must receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with these rare disorders are missing certain liver enzymes so that they can &apos;t divide the embroi@@ dered waste products , which can not be able to reti@@ re after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you have conducted laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you can affect AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may not take you because the medicine could go over to breast milk and hurt your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disorders , ref@@ illing of obe@@ dience , des@@ ori@@ ents , memory disorders and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms , check immediately with your doctor , or with the emergency of your hospital in connection with the introduction of a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the in@@ gest@@ ion of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects are considerably imp@@ aired or you notice side effects , which are not specified in this manual formation . &quot;
you may not be able to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the &quot; &quot; usable up to &quot; the exp@@ iry date . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ rhyth@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , in un@@ stable att@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( a abnormal measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion may be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
&quot; in patients with att@@ ina or heart attack , this can contribute to the heart and raise the effectiveness of a PCI . &quot;
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , where the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox is compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; while the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from GP@@ I - regarding the prevention of new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac attacks , or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who subjected to a PCI was angi@@ ox in terms of all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox must not be applied in patients , possibly excessive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with heavy blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS , while a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . an approval for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary sy@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable att@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift farms ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) , when an early intervention is intended . &quot;
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is performed in further sequence a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h is increased . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI Express requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose is 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a reduction of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is made of an initial intraven@@ ous output of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg of body@@ weight , and one of these intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to less than 225 seconds , should take a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the amount of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bolshe@@ vi@@ us dose quickly administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney stones ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated with a PCI ( if using Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg and re @-@ check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes to the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without a dose to dose 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ question@@ able Hep@@ ar@@ ine or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
• known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine &apos;s active blood disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ic diseases and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial En@@ do@@ kar@@ dit@@ is . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully provided during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of an bleeding especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if in PCI @-@ patients suffering from Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , most bleeding in arter@@ ial cells can occur in patients who are under@@ taking a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment of basically any bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be achieved before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge about the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ ar@@ ine , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ dencies ) , it can be assumed that these active ingredients are increasing the risk of blood . &quot;
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in any case regularly control .
&quot; the animal tests are in@@ adequate in relation to the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see under Section 5.3 ) . &quot;

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in those with Hep@@ ar@@ ine @-@ related comparison groups it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measure for heavy bleeding as in table 2 of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less often than in the group with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 4 g / dl without obvious blood point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood stress , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ ations associated with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; Pun@@ ishment , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
&quot; the following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6,000 patients who under@@ took a PCI . &quot;
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in those with Hep@@ ar@@ ine @-@ related comparison groups it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less often than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organic classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of overdose , treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ding is immediately removed and the patient should monitor eng@@ m@@ asch@@ ig in terms of signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as at the A@@ ni@@ on@@ en@@ bin@@ der region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or to Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and there@@ with its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ ails the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , making the function of the active Centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated . &quot;
&quot; moreover , by bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in with serum of patients , in which it had occurred in the past to he@@ par@@ in@@ ized Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , not induc@@ ing any thro@@ mb@@ ocy@@ tes ag@@ gregate reaction . &quot;
&quot; in patients with healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in provides a dos@@ is@@ - and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is covered by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the patient below a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine was given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ able Hep@@ ar@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered in patients with un@@ stable att@@ itudes ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable att@@ itudes ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GP@@ IB / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk types , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent Isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ological biom@@ ar@@ ker , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ gone a angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require a treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s , or the upper arm inj@@ uring or as continuous fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease , in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood , or the insulin can not process effectively . &quot;
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions differ very much of human@@ kind , and the change means that it seems faster and a shorter period of action has as a short @-@ effective human@@ kind . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with type 2 diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main inde@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study , with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % was observed after six months ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal coverage . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients , possibly excessive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can be dealt with blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Germany GmbH granted approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection through continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdominal muscles .
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and dimin@@ ished insulin delivery , insulin demand can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effectiveness , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delay etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 An in@@ adequate dosage or dis@@ ruption of treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these conditions are potentially li@@ fel@@ i@@ rous . &quot;
the conversion of a patient on another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be done under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
&quot; at the time of occurr@@ ence of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin , and can therefore change with the change of the treatment schem@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the substances that increase blood glucose activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ dem@@ ics , include orange anti@@ diabe@@ tic enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ or , fibro@@ ox@@ et@@ ine enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , meth@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ ox@@ es , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiot@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effects of sympath@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ di@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter@@ balance are not weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments for reproductive medicine showed no difference between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ kind regarding the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin occurs in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated after oral application . &quot;
&quot; following clinical studies , listed in clinical trials were identified , group@@ ed by system organs and arranged according to the frequency of their occurr@@ ence ( very frequent : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( frequencies based on the necessary ba@@ iting data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to change the injection unit within the range of injection can occur in a sequence of Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ dem@@ ics with loss of consciousness can be treated using an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropri@@ ated person or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; according to a Glu@@ k@@ agon@@ in@@ eration , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the urine cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
&quot; studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin injec@@ tions in the mode of effect , the real time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em regular insulin . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ insulin @-@ relevant dos@@ ing range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional flow of glu@@ ing effect , and at 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glu@@ ing effect , just like human@@ kind . &quot;
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as rapid response in@@ action such as normal human@@ kind and achieves full @-@ cosmic effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ kind .
&quot; data from the data was confident that with an application of insulin injec@@ tions 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions was taken in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ den@@ ial control than with human normal insulin was given for 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin injec@@ tions occur in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as in human normal insulin is given ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions in gift 2 minutes before the start of the meal ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before a meal ( Figure 1B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ te , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) . &quot;
