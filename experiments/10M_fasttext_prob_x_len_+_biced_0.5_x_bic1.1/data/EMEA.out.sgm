<seg id="6">"in the past, Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of increased agitation or behavioral dysfunction if the oral medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be applied to one or the melt tablets in patients, where the swallowing of tablets is prepared."</seg>

<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripigeon zol probably works mainly as "partial agulation" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripianzol such as 5 hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but at lower measurements than the neurotransmitter is to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripianzol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby preventing psychological or manic symptoms and preventing their re-occur."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, which prevent re-occur symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of injection solution was compared to two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which compared to increased agitation, compared to two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent repeating in 160 patients where the manian symptoms were stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which compared to increased agitation, which compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, changes in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scope for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>

<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased agitation than the patient who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was reduced in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo treated the repetition of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses have also reduced the symptoms of increased agitation and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>

<seg id="2970">"in a study with type 2 diabetes, Apidra was investigated in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indeator for the efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glykosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
