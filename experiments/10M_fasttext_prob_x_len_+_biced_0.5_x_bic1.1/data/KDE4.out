&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , presents a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; exists in it , portra@@ y folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is displayed proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , the size of the size of the entries is specified . according to this way , large files can be detected , even if they can be seen far below in the folder hier@@ archy . according to this , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display represents a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful colours and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rectangle that can be switched on color mode , can be either deep@@ ened to the light detection of the switching depth or the picture of another file association as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be labeled with the various features of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can define , only if enough space is available , or if enough space is available to display or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ance can be used by limitations during the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . moreover , you can define the relative position of labelling in the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; at Dar@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target will not always be available . note that less space for the frame is lost , if the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; as divi@@ ding the surface of a entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left . here it is to be favourable to the surface and avo@@ idance the areas as possible . the best methods of these are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can define the minimal floor area for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is drawn into the area of the over@@ taken entry to indicate that this area is actually covered by an under@@ or@@ derly entry . &quot;

&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; contains a fast image processing with basic training tools . you can use them to comment and correct your photos , comment on , evaluate and correct . editing skills can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate , it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour pur@@ ification - workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens , can be searched for . &quot;
like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs are also &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; an open source project . that means it is based on the support of the end of the end . they should therefore report problems and improvement for improvement .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate , trying to make problems or suggestions for them as easy as possible . wherever you are in the program , the help menu includes one entry in error message system . all required information are registered here . follow the instructions to send your account . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means , if you have any regular users of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; then , we would like to give you questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be happy to be aware of this language . &quot;
you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ ate ; homepage visit to news about free versions and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; is the registration in the developer @-@ mail@@ ing@@ list . guidance to report in the developer @-@ mailing list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; .
&quot; if you got &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; go to the first time , you will be asked to specify your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , distant or remote folder . enter a folder name or click on the folder icon folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you will need to specify a local file on your computer . this path will be stored for all image folders . &quot;
later you can add a lot of folder as you would like to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; will you additionally use as an instrument library .
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top file that contains images as basic file . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; consider any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed when using the folder , you can see a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; dur@@ y re@@ cur@@ sive the li@@ br@@ ush@@ chair in its whole depth . you can &apos;t close any sub@@ folder as it is a box in stiff@@ ened folder . this allows you to insert un@@ hal@@ bs &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; do you complete a point before the name of the sau@@ er .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as basic folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List will have no photos as symbols . you can change that by using a big@@ uous picture from the album and this will be used as an album symbol . more details will be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic file , you can set up in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you should learn how to use my albums and my talk box to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ dat@@ as@@ Support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can handle it ; possibly you can handle if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ assist . &quot;
how to setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
&quot; a easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be available to you to connect to your digital camera , and you can download your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ eras . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader is supported by using &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; working together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera can also be realized as a disk drive system . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; G@@ Photo@@ 2 supports the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital kam@@ er@@ as@@ . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , further distribution collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to host and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the host . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ is@@ sions on the serial port is slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete ; supports this camera and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the EX@@ IF support is not provided by a couple of lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may have pre @-@ looking images or the production could be very slowly . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ m@@ g. and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide modules for all graphics programmes . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . its advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; by writing a small module to complement one function , as the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either change the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and lay of pictures everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , via the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only limitation is not that a picture cannot be put in sample , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; file selection allows you to lift the most common choice : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , Movies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields , which are currently displayed in the symbol view . just when this one of the file is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame . you can configure which fields can be displayed in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; set up a organized view on your photo albums . all photos , which were saved by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; these albums can be stored on the hard disk , in which they were created on the hard disk , in which the album was first created , the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . then , you can add an album photo directly to an album . select the album import@@ ing photo . &quot;
&quot; to move or move a picture from an album to another or move on , you can move the photo using the mouse on the target album and go there . you can also move on the same way through multiple photos or copy them . simply select all photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the Alb@@ um@@ Properties allow you to access information about this collection . to click on the album , you must click on the album and edit Alb@@ um@@ Properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums so you can be group@@ ed under a common name for sorting your photos , if you want to add or delete albums from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add new collections or delete albums , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
&quot; the buttons elder , average , latest : this setting the date to calculate the oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . if this is missing , the date of the last change will be used in this folder instead . &quot;
&quot; when you first arrived in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate , the first picture will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo than album symbol , you &apos;ll need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; select the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be w@@ asted .

&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; character@@ izes each picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . these enables images to compare these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signals , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop any image . using a swelling , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture of somewhere over the symbol of un@@ precise search in the left side@@ bar , then you will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : a free sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; finds the matching pictures . also here you can set a swelling value .
this tab provides an intuitive ren@@ ches tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature Program . you can drag it to the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull out a square . all pictures within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this can naturally contain the images of ge@@ o data .
in the field you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . he works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; presents a lumin@@ aire in a separate window available with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To the lumin@@ ous menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous menu . if you are back in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; main window , you can open the light with L ex@@ tras table . &quot;
&quot; from the front panel you can compare the images that you want to compare , select in the left or right range of the window . if you &apos;re looking forward to what window frames can be seen . if you &apos;re looking forward to what window frames can be done , then these can compare this in the other image . so you can compare the same area of both images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series . if you &apos;re using a combination of tool@@ bar , then the two first images will be displayed in the right side . you can now use the left mouse button in the right side . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal holes are also working directly from the table like F4 file .... &quot;
all image information from the main side@@ bar of the main window are available for both models in the table . this makes it possible to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in til@@ ting function , which you cross the crossed arrows . to press the visible area of the picture , you &apos;ll need to click these click and the &amp; L@@ MB , then both images will show the same image range . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . use the zoom regulator under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel in the picture inside and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you are in the mode .
&quot; what is a digital existing management - apart from the fashion word ? digital existing administration , consider any part of the process after the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos is taken , sc@@ anned or digital photos will lead a form of digital existing management . but most of us do not make this in systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how you can backup your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we look at the procedure for digital photography the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; we view the download , ren@@ ame , assess , assess , evaluate , wait , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ tion@@ ed , sec@@ tion@@ ed , conf@@ ection@@ ed , conf@@ ection@@ ed and exported content that hab@@ it a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data via data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to maintain if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the approach the met@@ ad@@ ata is guaranteed to store in a database as well as in the image files , and you can access the met@@ ad@@ ata with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you do something in your system , the structure of information structure will have to be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you need to switch to a bigger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly via your memory location . if you have enough photos , then you will print sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you will print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files , and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure to this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes it easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the ad@@ ata site of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forgot this , you can subsequently select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database to select the appropriate point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? it sets &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; they are provided a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the most important . &quot;
&quot; now you start the real job , since you should now select any photo sample , labelling and an evaluation . of course , you can start the same attribute and then put the value . this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now call us with keyword , keys , as you can proceed with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded stit@@ ches , then &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; automatically add the tree to the right spot ; the sort of hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by using a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keyword will be followed by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; updated while the sub @-@ trees are pursued . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keyword , the next section refers to certificates or comments , the third important tool around your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; most of you want to see your photos just let you see , they want to share with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your pictures . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then start some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the landing site of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . Wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , so you may even hear the silence . so the lab@@ eling has completely changed this panoramic view . &quot;
&quot; for others the photos look at more important than the picture itself is more important than the picture itself . if you show pictures you should tell a story about it , the key is the meaning to help you to understand Him about the motive that you understand what you understand . &quot;
it is OK if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a certificate for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you can save any number of text in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as labelling . you can even make it possible for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE will also tell you to tell your wishes in the labelling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems , so you will have to tell the story for opening hours . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find out into another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train de@@ parts of the spatial presentation now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the options added to ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already un@@ controll@@ able and will be able to open in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually recre@@ ate your journeys . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a Word game with copyright and called the practice to remove the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also in all changed versions , so also for working others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; as information is deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field should be your name , or the name of the person who has been created . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support gre@@ y@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author Title ( syn@@ onymous with author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work of the photographers . examples : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the car field , this also has to be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ dding field to identify the photo . this does not necessarily need to be the author . if the photographer has been here for a news agency , such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then this organizations will be displayed here . if the image has been shown here , here the group / agency has given the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , though this does not provide protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; is available in the near future a module for st@@ acking processing .
&quot; topics : record error , record loss , power ratings , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disin@@ formation , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ st@@ itions &quot;
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section there is problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
&quot; Kro@@ ll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these c@@ auti@@ ous must be treated and you can &apos;t miss out more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your measuring space . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices , but they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it &apos;s about to select the right way . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you were just written only . therefore , they use a control room mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection it uses chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications for damaged disks , hard disks , Flash@@ media , USB drives etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the For@@ mat@@ war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything has been said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; slowly burn the data back to the next generation of media with a description , date &amp; author &apos;s license and later on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media or software that can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s manufacturer include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ closure of the disk &quot;
&quot; shortly , Dis@@ ks maintain the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most frequent error code , SM@@ ART can not notice this error . some of the SM@@ ART can not notice this error . these are especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing meter . the expected lifetime time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is just about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also use data loss due to a power if you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices are not much needed , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes are different . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , hard data loss , hard@@ ships and other defects . protect themselves before the un@@ avo@@ id@@ able loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; most common protection against electricity sp@@ ik@@ es is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of energy storage , and it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . do not think that any plug bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects protection against lighten@@ ing , so that it protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be connected to your computer , you should also know that any peripher@@ als can be connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms that also provide a phone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for traveling . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system before smaller fluctu@@ ations in the electric lines , it will not really help you . even a fall from a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection from over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices can automatically provide power @-@ energy if you want to store your data and keep the system arranged . some models allow them to be able to store the same quality requirements like a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concern the potential risk , which is exposed to your computer system , and compare its safety with the cost to avo@@ idance this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection may get you for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you are thinking about your computer . at the end , you always remember all the cables before you ride into the holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer of your software . &quot;
&quot; compared to the hard drives , however , you are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of major images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services on photos stored on photos . the professional variant provides you more available , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ a year you get unlimited storage that should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted with the TCP protocols and the large firms are included in the offer a backup and a distribution storage . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are applicable to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integral between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst part is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred . all these disturb@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection for it . it is rather wor@@ r@@ ying that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data path than that of your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable grid parts are another source of transmission lu@@ sts because they generate interaction within the data streams . these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle with turn@@ outs on a lower level and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will be available soon for Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms , and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t appreciate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses on not@@ ebook and 46 % at the job systems . at Not@@ ebooks , the share of theft was 50 % . &quot;
data loss because of viruses is less widespread than the most . it leads to a less@@ er damage than e.g. theft steels or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has already been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the more common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided before the problem was not completely stored before the problem was lost . &quot;
viruses are the largest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while technology is further developed , there is a natural border for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics are no longer away from this limit . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xels . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the final result is the optimal for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats .
&quot; now you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro . so , so you don &apos;t guarantee any other loss for data loss . therefore , you &apos;re doing your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you can make anything dangerous as the re@@ installing your operating system , exchange of records or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget an aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft , are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern one whole room or the whole house . &quot;
&quot; hence , des@@ ast@@ er@@ fle@@ ction does not mean local storage . bring your f@@ uses up into the stairs into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as already mentioned above is one more common reason for a loss of data loss in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be backed up . it is a moment of moment without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
&quot; differentiation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup , generates a complete moment of snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differentiation . &quot;
&quot; in order to backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . generates several moment of snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time again . this f@@ use comes with an sion@@ ing system , the next one , which is only down@@ ward and not continuously . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that can easily set you up to your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer script r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase safety via ssh .
secure major pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment of work for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for every month . every further notice should be done manually , after which you have done a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copying the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable pictures can survive the next 40 year that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because you remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to its nature , you must consider everything today . unfortunately , there is no other way to manage and re @-@ evaluate it . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system back@@ wards . if less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available today for each . if you &apos;re an old system that &apos;s important to read your pictures and then store it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and f@@ use technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
&quot; let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and put it on a new record : &quot;
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was recognized by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
/ dev / S@@ DC # source code / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC # source ; # / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it then you can create this yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary and patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore you should not use it anymore .
&quot; P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard , but it can save much more . it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ Bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG may need multiple management information , but not as many as T@@ IFF , and not as many as T@@ IFF , we recommend to store your pictures . &quot;
&quot; T@@ IFF was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IFF may be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss free compression of compression ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , it is possible to store your images in this format . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a license @-@ free and open shell format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed because of the need to use the camera data formats based on the T@@ IFF / EP format and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is an identification technology that allows users to insert their data into a file itself . the file information is stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to view a original version of your photo , mostly in the rough format , as it stores the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . however , it can be found to solve problems between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of application purposes and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I belong to the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ing efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata ards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera type , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your rough archives . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut by the other programs under circumstances . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in we@@ gal@@ eries , add in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; in the section adding a photos to an album , you can add a description of how you can already add on your hard disk . the camera interface provides you however many more advanced settings to convert pictures to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; connect these with the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and switch them . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , you try to connect to your camera . if the connection is manufactured , a fer@@ ential -@@ indicator at the lower end and the demonstration images are displayed on the camera . some cameras are not displayed on the camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association settings can be displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see camera information on each entry . with the page properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera @-@ interface you can see the characteristics of a entry or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information , which are stored intern@@ ally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that in some digital cameras do not have any information available . &quot;
&quot; the tab met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer note , GPS , etc. of the picture . these information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; or the image processing . please note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button , and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; for downloading the photos will not be deleted , and we will be sure to delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only download the chosen methods used by &amp; K@@ DE . once you have chosen the photos , use the button download and then select the chosen ones . the button is selected as long as you select some photos selected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images were not yet selected by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; in this case , the new pictures have been selected using a star in front case . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you can download the buttons all or chosen out , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album , in which the photos are sorted out . details of the existing albums can be sorted out in the section My records . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all delete the button . if you only want to delete a button , you must first select this first and delete the delete selected . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore from the camera to restore from the camera . so you should be careful whether the photos were successfully deleted in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you should be careful if you want to er@@ ase the camera &apos;s camera , because this is considerably faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the file names will usually run again after the photos taken from the camera . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time where the picture was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirror @-@ based sub@@ titles . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a file per day . &quot;
&quot; the options During the Transfer opens three further options that are performed before the photos stored on the record . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information is copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to read another date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % H : % M : % S . switch to the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in small letters . or in case of capital letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; for a photo is used , below the name indicated that the camera will be stored in preview , and automatically uses your settings to ren@@ ame , when you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; can also use all the information on the orientation of the camera to mark a automatic rotation during her@@ ring . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page panel met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has been embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , it can be switched &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the photo in the original orientation , use the button Advanced , and choose the automatic rotation at the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera was made information about the date , where the photo was made available , you can use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; this sub@@ titles are based on the same sub@@ album . all cameras with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can report that information your camera can be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button Advanced and choose the option @-@ based sub@@ titles at the lower end of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from their computer to your camera is the button . then select upload . the file association dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears in which you can select the files , you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the picture selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to load the upload . images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position can be displayed in long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude that can be displayed on a map . identi@@ fying the data can be performed from the US GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographer , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser to address the area . if you want to show a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; users want to locate the location of the photos , or simply add this aspect , it is good to en@@ rich the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 has many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ ers and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last via the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is no camera which has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or by transmission of the data using a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , these data must be stored in the GP@@ X format , since this is the only format supported by the module &apos;s geographical assignment . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs @-@ placed coordinates using map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; so much control over his work processes such as possible . there are many att@@ itudes to access the behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to set up this settings , you must change in the menu settings . you can change between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; action can be placed on a preview of view or image editing , so that the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants came ; firmly , when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standard di@@ str@@ acy and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . even if the database is synchron@@ ized , these data are syn@@ ced to the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author Chapter is a syn@@ onym for the editor of author : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this may also be a photographer , freelance photographer , or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description to the author , this field must be filled too . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to use the photo . this must not be the author , as such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency will be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ Fel@@ der@@ . this met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently stored in the image and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported without lost .
&quot; image cap@@ tions as embedded certificates ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes comments , which you have to add to your photos , which can be read in pictures too . attention : in pictures that are already lab@@ elled , these are over@@ written by using &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; &quot;
&quot; the page Settings contains all the options for the information that appear if the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window on a file rests . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to consoli@@ date , you can add the file extension to this list and remove any file in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Alb@@ um@@ folders that does not have this expan@@ sions , by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset , by pressing the button on the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can only get a better test results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch this here . you can use the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors will be set here . in image editing this document can be switched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the images are encoded as a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for further explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is not the image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss of loss . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the T@@ IFF file option , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate g@@ low levels for T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of low @-@ loss JPEG 2000 files , you can save any loss of loss . even if you were posted in any loss of loss , the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was still not supported but was found in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate , the image processing is only a picture viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard reference is that all green pixels are equal to more sensitive on ultra@@ violet light than the pixels at odd lines . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option features a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 g@@ itter@@ ing pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white @-@ off is used as the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white surface is not set . standard is a solid color balance , which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors the effect of the second sensors will receive more details in four steps more details . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the top of these images , so the parts of your images are embedded in the settings , as through the in@@ ability of your camera . use the setting in various ros@@ aries , as they can try to re@@ design some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ em@@ akers . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general is not so fast , such as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ design the missing green and red shares of the nor saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image separately . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be made later in the image options of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; -@@ image editing , you should go more conservative . &quot;
a demo algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the part data which have many cameras and the one matrix @-@ colour pixel . this algorithm is also known as a CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour structure .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w also has three alternatives to your disposal : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it was created . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color depth of your lenti@@ ls , you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color file correction , since it is carried out during the resource conversion . &quot;
one profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; information such as the color space of one color space in the others are so accurate as possible .
&quot; behaviour , if a picture is opened in image processing / colour management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color Profile folder S@@ etting the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you all store your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; exam@@ ines these folders then during the start . &quot;
&quot; settings of the ICC profiles , you have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later . &quot;
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your images are not managed by the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be used to the camera operator and model you can use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which does not have colour ton@@ ing mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . this means that you have to do the tone mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can &apos;t work again , because your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colours are therefore very satisfied , instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not for the models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this response is naturally un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion lets you recognize the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image records and image processing ; many modules support which have been written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . then select the modules you want , and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks that are performed by modules , can be set to set up menu on Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org , or in the text@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b is adjusted the time between the image trans@@ itions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes are stored on the met@@ ad@@ ata , which ends at the bottom end of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties shown on the left is a list of all cameras supported on the left . on the right side it is connected to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . among them are the port settings . currently , serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are currently supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire cameras ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) camera cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to insert here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; to use , you must connect the camera with your computer to put them in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set cam@@ er@@ o@@ dell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog for the shifting of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; in the del@@ e@@ tion of an album , you can find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes due to the right side bar may be silent through &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; applied , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without question . otherwise you have to use the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also add the ad of the welcome image of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate , while starting with the starting process , it acceler@@ ates the start of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the setting is looking for new photos to search for new photos ; search the base file after new or deleted albums / photos . if something from the basic file was deleted , asking &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can be selected under settings design from the tool bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in writing a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos , and improve the image editing , click the preview of a picture or by the Con@@ text menu of the entry and entry of the updated advertis@@ ements / works . &quot;
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; so they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in section image processing .
&quot; a status bar at the lower edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the upper rim , including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions . &quot;
&quot; editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , no of the functions will change the original photo before you can save File Save or the button Save from the tool bar . note that you don &apos;t have the original photo to be saved once you have the picture saved . &quot;
&quot; so you should make a copy of your image , before you can change it . you can save with file saving as well . &quot;
&quot; as long as you don &apos;t have saved the photo , you can restore the original image by rest@@ oring the button file or restore the button . you will then lose any change that you have done at the photo since the last Save . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can reverse , by selecting re@@ loc@@ ating or re@@ produced , by choosing re@@ produce from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to restore and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you push the &amp; L@@ MB , you can press a moment on the back or restore button in the tool bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all promotions will also be removed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you start the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation file in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have changes on the current photo , you will be asked if you want to back these . &quot;
you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ si@@ can menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlargement factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full screen image shows the photo in full screen mode . you &apos;ll be able to use the Es@@ c key . if you don &apos;t want this , you can change this in the setup dialog by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you can also call this section to set the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print them in the menu image and get the default &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can print the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single pictures or entire phr@@ ases . all image files can be printed from your selection . you need to select the pictures with the default settings and select from the menu album , export printing assist@@ ent . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , the important information and actions for the selected pictures are available . the same side@@ bar is available , even in image editing , even if one of the five riders are cli@@ cked : &quot;
&quot; multiple times click on the same rider , the side@@ bar will appear and disappear again into the edge . &quot;
&quot; in the labelling of view , you can enter labelling with unlimited size or add . note that the text is compatible UTF @-@ 8 . that means that all special characters are permitted , so that all special characters are allowed to use in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields that you may be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters , if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after that , you are using either the button users or simply switch to the next image , the certificates will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the user button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , this will always be performed if you have selected a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting order . it can always be used with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the keyboard player C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several pictures at the same time , select this and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering of the keyword , the keyword tree , and a selection box with the previously specified in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; -@@ session of the keyword . &quot;
the keyword tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the given search phrase . you can easily limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is another relief at the input of keyword in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keyword will also be set in the tree by marking the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all the tags of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the sample tree , this only can be applied to the selected image and not to the entire selection , if you want to choose a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sample filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar will be used with their album , - date , sampling and search results . if in addition , one or more sample filter from the right side are used , only the cutting quantity of these two are displayed . all given words are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw out tags and place . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword exists already , you can simply put it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . as a result , a dialog appears if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is selected on no keywords , which the quantity was reduced to three images . they were drawn into the selection and placed there . a dialog is asking if this keyword should be set . &quot;
these search for changes will take place at any start of the program . you can also be disabled under the settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be a or be , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key term , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name , or a string that is already placed in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can find a Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then follow the button . the options then look as follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in the full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; s specific implementation .
&quot; the reason why you can use a color@@ fully designed workflow , which can reach a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from your camera or scanner . with a coloured workflow you can achieve that the colors will be printed on your monitor or scanners on your monitor or in the Web , which allows you to print them from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know what buttons it must be asked for the results which he wants . unfortunately , this tut@@ orials is to provide you sufficient background information about color administration . additionally , links with deeper information will make you make your own informed decisions to make you the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image flows were fulfilled every six below criteria , then you must not worry about color administration . &quot;
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; their only photographs are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB of the de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for everyone makes it easy , why should I make a different colour space and make your thoughts about p@@ atter@@ ned ng ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger dy@@ es , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to kiss my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! if you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to kiss your Monitor . so you &apos;re using your monitor via s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases , so before you try to try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions standardi@@ zation , equal , automatic and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ orous automatic correction will automatically try to make the best . they will experiment with these effects to see what &apos;s best at your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize the leu@@ k@@ ative values above the whole image , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing color sha@@ dy . this function is often an mag@@ ician correction for images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; same : this method adjust the illumin@@ ating factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity channels are as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in improvement of the image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracle in a picture , or it destro@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjustment the red , green and blue channels in the entire hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ous thickness of the RGB values of a picture by shifting the lowest and highest values in the wid@@ est range and a new ji@@ v of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white @-@ off of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photos .
&quot; the white @-@ equal correction is somewhat limited to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color , so if you can perform the white @-@ off in rough mode , which can be done in 16 @-@ bit mode , so you will get your ways to correction better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white equ@@ ali@@ m of copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they launch it on the menu entry colours white off the image editing .
&quot; the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original picture is adjusted as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original whit@@ ish , then it &apos;s enough to click on the lower window . &quot;
the preview of the destination photographs has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pi@@ xels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; to the right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixel very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your score depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma . shadow Ali@@ gn@@ ment allows you to improve the sha@@ dows of your photos or di@@ mm@@ ing down . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above @-@ mentioned controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then automatically set the colour temperature for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white . on this type , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you can set the tin@@ ge right with the list of settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ l@@ ins@@ ulator increases the colours if more than a colour channel of the pi@@ er is exagger@@ ated . this will display the combined result in the white @-@ off . this will be shown as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and loading make exactly this . any adjustment of the white curve you can set to back into a text file and re@@ load later .
the default settings uses all filter values back to its standard values and the associated neutral white down@@ stream . notice that neutral settings will be another photo than your original . if you save them your original picture will be changed .
&quot; you can set the coding per colour channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . but this coding requires even more record field , calculation time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialogue like the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ ing can be carried out through the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can withdraw the chapter color administration .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu below color sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust and allows you to adjust these settings , so that you will always need to adjust these for multiple photos , so you can always need the same correction . in the manual for audio files you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you will find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of the chemical processing was solar isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the image was created when one partly developed a short flash light and afterwards the development of the image was modified . the result was a partial negative picture . this tool allows you to adjust this very interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar control . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase creates a negative picture that is not possible to create phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar panel . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the revised intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; Effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one in daylight optim@@ ated color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . its name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and makes a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors as well as some c@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those who barely li@@ vel@@ ed the landscapes are too much . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light to the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the magn@@ itude of the result and the sli@@ p@@ case repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on . at large pictures , the filter can ski@@ p the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras frequently have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color Con@@ tr@@ ast and the lumin@@ ous thickness of your photos with the tools in the menu below . once you are satisfied with the results you are using the button O@@ k and you are used .
&quot; if you make a photo of bad light , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can be able to increase the satur@@ ation instead . if the results you can do , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ strength / contrast / gamma , the tool is very complicated to improve exposure of exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of sliding use only . specifically , the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ o@@ program . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the inside and the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ators , and make sure how the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview of the picture is displayed dynam@@ ically , on the left hand , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram is dominated with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three colour pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to automatically adjust the input of the shadow , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used in order to evaluate the output values , for example , the compression of output may be used as a background to create something different in the fore@@ ground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set in depen@@ dency of the image values automatically . &quot;
&quot; store as and store : stored in the file system , the Gim@@ p levels are stored in the file system and later , the Gim@@ p levels are used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input will automatically be adjusted for all sha@@ dows , resources and sunlight . activate the paint pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the preview of the original picture for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the input of the input lines applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamic depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
&quot; Modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this selection box allows the channel to connect to the module , which is changed from the module : &quot;
&quot; in addition to this box , two symbols are set to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a Kur@@ vent@@ eil to the right , for example , the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds are related with dark extracts , and the corresponding image pixel is dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to move this marking on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on this line and move up a point on this line and move it up until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you can create this file and later it can be loaded with file format . the file format is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; when you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the control points for all channels of the shadow , central and sun@@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option to display over@@ exposed pixels in order to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel superior pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun@@ tones was set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; the channel mixer of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels , or change the colour sha@@ des of the photos . &quot;
&quot; the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour tones of images . they can process it from the menu @-@ mixer of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; selecting the Channel box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels . the left section of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed as a comparison on your own riders . &quot;
the preview of the Target has a red markers . if you move this in the picture there is a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding colour value .
&quot; the controls for the module are on the right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to activate these channels . if you can also keep the corresponding colour components , as the channel mixer will also keep the corresponding colour components . this is particularly convenient if you also want to reduce the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient if you can also reduce the key color components . try the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , leads the reduction of a color to a visible noise which looks from the colour channel . if that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the colour@@ ing first . &quot;
storing as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting you can save and then load . that used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re@@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step that can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film clips profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
green filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lenti@@ l filter . this looks good at all the scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Grün@@ filters .
orange film : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ filtered . &quot;
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic ascension effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ ful of moon to day time . so similar to 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ Filter .
&quot; yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour ton@@ ic correction , improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter . &quot;
&quot; Sep@@ timi@@ on : this creates warm light and medium tones while adding a bit cold in the sha@@ kes . this is very similar to the trial of a print and re@@ development in a sep@@ tic tank . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother , and so similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture on your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry picture can be used for this image . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the tigh@@ tening of depth and three dimensional texture on the image .
a paper Tex@@ tu@@ re@@ ff@@ ect has been applied to the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) . the Parameter Relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to an image . &quot;
&quot; the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task . a possibility to keep his attention it is to maintain a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . under image frame , the module can be started using the image processing . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . the picture with a colored line , Nie@@ p@@ ce surround it with a nice line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it fits with a nice three dimensional frame and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : the width of the frame is in percent . the range of value for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; it will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the pictures , especially when you cut the tool After aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple a format text into any image . this also applies to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text @-@ replacement , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its qualities as you need . finally , you simply select one frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is finished . &quot;
&quot; each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool sten@@ cil , you can lay a sten@@ cil on a picture . &quot;
the menu image sten@@ cil to apply in image editing can be used to lay sten@@ cils above a picture .
&quot; for template there is no restrictions concerning the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should be added to the size of the file size of sten@@ cil , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; mailing list di@@ gi@@ ate @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base file in the dialog box . select the folder in which you &apos;ll notice the template files . &quot;
&quot; after the root file is set to sten@@ cils , a building view , which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s structure . selecting a folder updated the presentation of a template . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , three buttons are located with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is cent@@ ered to cent@@ ered the position of mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; resi@@ zed : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse . if you want to use the template onto the whole image , you need to adjust the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to shift the picture below template . take the picture and place it in the desired position .
&quot; use OK if you want to apply the template on your image , then the image will be adjusted automatically . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; produces three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny paintings . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ens mask is working on the contrast of the edges in the contrast to the edges . actually , it &apos;s no little bit psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it is a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and he is protected by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it &apos;s a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digit@@ ised images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . therefore , these elements are smaller than the resolution . the same phenomenon can be printed a little wounded . the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . SLR cameras will usually need more retro@@ active as normal cameras for the private application . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG image , an image of internal shar@@ pen@@ ing has been used . images in the rough size must always be scre@@ ened during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanners make a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this de@@ activate , you will receive control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo of shar@@ pen@@ ing value . you can set up with the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; however , you should use it carefully because the results do not affect the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can achieve the most useful technology to shar@@ pen@@ ing the tool . below re@@ focus , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution , the image is a bit soft to draw , is much easier than it to sharp@@ ness . use the tool for the soft@@ ness with the menu entry . use the case on the right side of the dialogue . &quot;
filter Un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and preview can help you edit the picture . the presentation window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often tested . an increase of the radius , or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you generate the im@@ pose mask to be strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ates will create in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius presents a how many pixels on each side of a can@@ te are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ als . they should therefore sharp@@ ens images at the best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB @-@ value and the difference amount . it can therefore define a minimum difference for a can@@ te of filters . in this way , areas will be avoided with a soft change between the killing of the shar@@ pen and therefore the beauty of beauty in faces , heavens and water surface . &quot;
this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a corpor@@ al value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; General tools re@@ focus re@@ foc@@ fies a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted discharge filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to try a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ si@@ er@@ quot ; this is better approach than trying to try the photo . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ament . the traditional technology for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of an im@@ pose mask . you can start it out of the menu by calling colors re@@ focus on the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s run@@ off . the Gau@@ ge &apos;s f@@ folding has a very long tail , which does not affect the mathematical results far from the source pixel . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . that causes un@@ wanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular edge : this is the radius of the circular folding , it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture should be very un@@ sharp then on Heiligen@@ sch@@ ema . &quot;
&quot; correlation : the correlation can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . the correlation can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 . however , values above is very bad . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is 0.@@ 03 . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a useful value is still more tigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use these parameters when your shar@@ pen@@ al resistance is caused . in most cases , you should allow this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts , so you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation disk . if you have selected great results for the circular edge or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness , please note that the module is very slow if you select great values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; store as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter is set , so that it may be saved for later and then can be charged . &quot;
&quot; try to carry all cuts , color and intensity structures in the picture before you can use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible , but then leave un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read pictures and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp m@@ asked a bigger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
theore@@ tically it has to produce un@@ sharp m@@ asked forever . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the shar@@ per filter . it is virtually the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the in@@ shar@@ per mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour picture has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for auto focus lens .
&quot; for further information regarding the methods for shar@@ pen@@ ing correction in digital images , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the controller gl@@ itter sets the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the range , in order to create a more natural p@@ up@@ ille . &quot;
&quot; the tin@@ tin@@ te makes a customized colour for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want a blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove un@@ wanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different settings as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth gl@@ itter above the picture . a value of 0.9 ought to receive details that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary . please note that the details should always be arranged according to correc@@ ting movement . &quot;
&quot; correc@@ ting movement alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ dation or a CCD cat@@ ches , a high value of fibre can produce similar patterns . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts will be best at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum gl@@ ass@@ ment factor above all@@ ing@@ .@@ p then defines the relative inc@@ endi@@ ces . therefore , put this value for the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to appreciate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ en@@ ce@@ &apos; , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is running through . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angular length da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha small is selected , then it should also be small to produce a long run@@ time . so you should choose that small angle should be a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value so far as possible and choose your needs . &quot;
&quot; step@@ per span &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step@@ per span in pixels . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ aring and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more on quality you get through the option of this option is only low . but he doubles the run@@ time . therefore we recommend it therefore .
buttons save as and loading make exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
&quot; image errors is compar@@ atively very fast to work . however , it can still last very long and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see like picture error with little arti@@ facts . the module is shown on a photo that has been created in Guatemala City with an analog@@ ous camera that is caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and corrected the image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce frame control . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear .
this tool provides selectable image filter to remove spots and other arti@@ facts that are coming from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ counts ; -@@ effects of collected images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in English in this tut@@ orial . &quot;
picture photo shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny space that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the lower window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain at default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) that is needed for the filter . great values increase the time the filters per pixel is needed and can be used by the radius and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the shar@@ pen@@ ing distance . this value sets the pixel angle of the filter to the front look around lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details do not get more and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , you cannot remove the whole space or noise level . put it to a value near the maximum if you want a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance oler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . this settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . this settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details -@@ settings .
&quot; gamma : controls the tolerance tolerance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically are stronger , however , also the shadow ranges . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius can appear on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smooth and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter are visible on the edges . it can remove sound tips and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; store under and store : these buttons are used as well . all parameters for the noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later re@@ charged . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change their lives . the original pattern is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ isp@@ y for your purpose . the solution , the image is a bit soft to draw , is fortunately much easier than one picture to shar@@ pen . use it to the soft@@ mark on the right side of the dialogue it shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; photo rest@@ oring is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo art@@ ef@@ ts .
&quot; this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ ired art@@ e@@ facts of your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove tur@@ mo@@ wers , film gra@@ fts , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sive file and local mistakes which makes content such as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tures . the algorithm is developed using another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ an and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts Redu@@ ce JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it . as a loss of compres@@ sive compression levels it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this attitude should correct this problem .
the buttons save as and loading make exactly this . every setting of photo rest@@ oring can hereby be saved in a text file and later re @-@ loaded .
&quot; photo rest@@ oring is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and a high CPU load . therefore , you can stop the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; below , you can be reduced like a photo with equal noise levels . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ fts on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures was reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts which have been shown by the scanner and the photo image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos which have been used with a CCD camera . it uses this algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
&quot; bright , total or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw material photos , since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark sub@@ contra@@ ction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the assistant with the button dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image look .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first described , as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark image to the correct picture . notice that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and re@@ charge this automatically in the next meeting . &quot;
the picture area and the preview will help you correct the result . the presentation window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all aspects .
select an area around the defective pixels at preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ let : it is obtained an average of the neighboring pixel . the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels which have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn into order to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below , you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , it has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ing , i.e. lower corners , a picture . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lens , especially the middle and large photo format , can not evenly light up the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ig@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ dows ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light on the sensor . tel@@ e@@ objective also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filter require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which means that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should be used , even with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are created . &quot;
&quot; using the large exposure of today &apos;s fil@@ mic and grey stu@@ den@@ ces of digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using a C@@ enter@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light rein@@ forcement at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , to compens@@ ate an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate a slight degree of Vig@@ net@@ ing , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree . &quot;
&quot; Leu@@ ch@@ starch , Con@@ tr@@ ast and Gamma Settings : editing a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction decreased the lumin@@ ance of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers provide only positive values , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a host@@ ile new adjustment of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ing in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture has been performed with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; lens dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effects of spher@@ ical lenti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copyright algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion . color@@ able dist@@ ortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
&quot; the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the image . &quot;
&quot; the third @-@ degree coefficient has a similar circuit effect , but fl@@ att@@ ened to the edges . this correc@@ ting is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the co@@ effici@@ ents corrected the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion can be eliminated almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; generally : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values can be corrected , and positive values can be adjusted . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion fourth degree . this value seems stronger to change than in the middle of the picture . for most lenti@@ ls has the &apos; corners parameter the reverse sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads through a correction for the first degree . negative values can increase while positive the image .
&quot; brigh@@ test : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview the dist@@ ortion correction . the values you use for your image , are stored and the next start as standard values are used . &quot;
&quot; the tonn@@ e or carbon correction should be carried out before all cuts or size changes . at the best , you perform this correction as all first by . if you have a picture new to cut and then a tonn@@ e correction would be the effect of wrong the folding . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction to help you . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image look around the kn@@ itting lines , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection , you can correct the tonn@@ e / che@@ w dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you have a cool dist@@ ortion , the resulting image is black corners . you can remove these with the accessory tool in the menu , remove from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures the tonn@@ e correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as photos from the front , frame and painting it is the perspective so to correct the angle in picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ age correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website , which is available under this URL . filters re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can choose the range for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can adjust two parameter gra@@ iny and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film gra@@ iny and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter channels are mixed for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of an infr@@ a @-@ red filter cover in New Zealand . the original picture is set under ( 1 ) and the revised image below ( 2 ) and the revised image has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the s@@ lows .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter fil@@ ming is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film@@ making on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to enhance the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturer &apos;s big silver support in the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere get rid of everyday life . if you want this special , Galerie @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity . the default value is , although frequent values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film effects , applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and processed the ( 2 ) . the used fil@@ mic sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and sty@@ list@@ ings are good for this effect .
&quot; two controllers exist in order to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five out . thick@@ ening pain@@ t@@ brush are better for large images . smooth brush controls the gl@@ itter , or from the other side seen , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original pattern is marked with the ( 1 ) and the working width is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and gl@@ itter 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter charcoal drawing used color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a kohl@@ rab@@ k@@ iz@@ i . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch out . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the bottom adjustment the contrast ( gl@@ itter ) .
this is an example of the carbon recording filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Filter engraving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with a simple structure in which color does not use the most important on the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the image into a gray , slow landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of the filtering process . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using de@@ compos@@ itional effects . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wavelength 1 : divide the picture in cells and lets it look like if it is considered by gl@@ ass@@ blocks .
wavelength 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave of wave 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using infin@@ ity effects . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom In@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ den the image along st@@ ern@@ ing lines that go from a center . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al In@@ sharp@@ ens : wi@@ den the image by turning the pixel to a center . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ pregn@@ ation of a turning camera .
range of distances : wi@@ ki the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back into the background .
&quot; movement : im@@ pregn@@ ated the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ pregn@@ ation of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography . &quot;
&quot; soft@@ ening Un@@ shar@@ k : wi@@ den the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos , or add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sho@@ cker : wi@@ dens the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the in@@ firm@@ ary of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
smart Un@@ shar@@ k : finds the basin in the image and wi@@ dens these without the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
&quot; the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops to your image . thereby , it gives natural your pictures a nice appearance . it uses a pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm . &quot;
drop size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop size is not automatically increasing with size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the amount and density of drops . fish increases the optical effect of drops on the image .
&quot; you can keep up with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image editing a range of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a vision that will remain freely . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset over a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through sk@@ e@@ wers or turning into the right orientation . the tools can find the tools for turning , or transformer sk@@ e@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; photo v@@ ases is definitely one of the most advanced tools , to increase a photo at a minimum loss of image quality . &quot;
&quot; a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture out and guess the details ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select the size change in the menu , and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to size change is a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixel . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow . &quot;
many educational programs use a kind of interference such as spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original size is retained at the input of the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to appreciate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons save as and loading will be used exactly . any insert for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded again .
&quot; photo v@@ ases is very fast in what it does , but it can still last very long and get a high CPU load . you can stop the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
you can see below an example of the photo v@@ ases by using a small color image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement .
&quot; cutting of a photos is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together an image . the image processing allows you to cut a photo just the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull out the rectangle . you will see this rectangle then move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos is cut off again . this allows you to change a good overview of your photo after the cut . you can create the size of the cut area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . create a new rectangle by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the assignment , use the button the button @-@ button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save below in the menu to store the newly built photo . &quot;
&quot; in the presentation area you can change the size of the rectangle by shift the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you defined in dialogue , will be retained . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high format or cross format . in the high format the larger value of the height and the width format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you have cm , inc@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo postcard and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialogue , there are two buttons to select the selection automatically or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set up the area for cutting the area to the maximum possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool according to aspect ratio , stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertically ) . if you use the accessory tool , these settings are mir@@ ro@@ red in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are mir@@ ro@@ red and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; in order to help themselves , help themselves allow you to capture your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third hills , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles . &quot;
&quot; golden center : the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell , or the pet@@ als of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things that we feel nice . &quot;
&quot; the golden partition is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks , who thus use your temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you have your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number runs from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two numbers . the following divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition of this rule is considered visual harmon@@ ic . &quot;
the golden center provides lique@@ fied extra lines when you set up a picture . these help are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ al will give you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third party , the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye by the image . this kind of composition runs along the line of spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also known as gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition . it can be a line or different objects . this can be just there without the eye , it will fulfill its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden triangles are also discussed above the above golden spiral . its ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the sides of gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not an equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to place on these lines can be a static object dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden triangles to break your frame , you create a effect of professional photographer dynamic sym@@ met@@ ry . try your picture focus on one of the cutting edge and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach . &quot;
the options Horizont@@ al reflect and vertically can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the aux@@ iliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . on this type you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture by any angle .
&quot; if you do a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where the things are rot@@ ated by an angle ; image editing and tool @-@ free rotation . select the Free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are set in degrees . with the button default , you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right side of the window . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture show around the two lines . now , you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is to use the function of transformation from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function automatic cut . select one of the following options :
&quot; the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . note , however , notice the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ cent@@ ric Transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the upper : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjust@@ ing the perspective the picture will be a bit sp@@ ared . for individual adjustment this effect is small , but two custom@@ iz@@ ations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after completing the perspective , you get un@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to ber@@ some is it to cut this picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool tool is used to move a part of the picture to the opposite direction and the other part in the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted , in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module via transformation . &quot;
&quot; sciss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . you can adjust horizontal and vertically at the same time . if you press on default , the angle of the effectiveness will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is built . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines to adjust your picture . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the calibration , the picture will be a bit wi@@ ped out . for a single shift , this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two sha@@ des have been causing twice as much failure and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after crossing the image , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the picture with transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write pictures of image formats , therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type like these libraries comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on this site . however , they will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; only shows files in formats . this is done using the file extension , and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the list , you can change this list of file extension refers to . in the configuration configuration , you can find further information . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to use the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced , in order to save the image data on an efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smooth results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s may also save any loss of loss , if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the shell format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge used in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supports the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; here , more than 200 rough formats are supported . here , the table below shows a short list of raw materials that came by &amp; di@@ gi@@ as ; supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . it does not understand these formats and is therefore no film processing program and therefore does not work with built @-@ in options . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings are used to play movies to play the program for playback .

the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself the target of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE program .
&amp; graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are free layout programs . &amp; graphical viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; programme in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s new calcul@@ ates and in &amp; graphical viewer ; represents )
&quot; menu to open the graph in &amp; Kate ; open or graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ Compon@@ ent to open &quot;
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots )
additional needed software : &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program that pro@@ ving the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of the graph@@ s . required in detail :
&quot; the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate window . at first , if you start &amp; k@@ is@@ viewer ; without a argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the symbol file and open the ( empty ) list . Click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the Graph is larger than the character area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse on the mouse ( up and down without any special keys , left and right by pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . see below the maximum reduction of a graph@@ s .
&quot; when the file has just changed in &amp; k@@ graph ; loaded file from another program , the following window is displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , so your choice may also notice that later . if you want to change your decision later , you can use your choice later , you can setup your choice settings ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; graphic viewer ; instance , or eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; instance , or want to open a graph in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but this also will change with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last meeting again . again , you can back up your choice as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also define how the graph is divided into several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph@@ s which are on one side will be placed on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graphite . &quot;
&quot; page preview with one on multiple sides , Graph@@ ene without head@@ line and with another font &quot;
&quot; the page again gives the opportunity to determine the behavior when a file is changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can restart a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or changes the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the page is opening the opportunity to determine the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; determine if a graph will be open outside a running session , or you can open a default behavior in a new window , or determine that every time is asked . &quot;
the site seat administration gives the opportunity to determine the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph . you can open a default behavior ( the files of the last meeting or not ) or determine when you start to start .
&quot; the context menu , usually with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorith@@ ms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of oriented graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as possible short edges and as possible as few edge cuts . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; Algorith@@ m is the standard for invali@@ d graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the jumping model , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional scal@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for invali@@ d graph@@ s a spr@@ inting model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ alism , and includes a multi @-@ grid to treat large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm uses the knots of circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lical structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which you can specify a shell command , which then will be executed by a shell . the order should specify the graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei as a parameter , and the calculated layout of graph@@ s to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout commands , you can change specific options , or even the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or invali@@ d ) , and turns the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for acting , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invali@@ d graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;

&quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . the above to see dialog appears . to upload a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , of course , you need to load a track file using GP@@ X file , such as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation was performed in red . GPS track data is recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore , the camera range has to be converted with GMT . this can be carried out with the time zone . place your camera zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera production . if the devi@@ ation below , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have track data from one place for pictures , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate to all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options of inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have any appropriate data . if you know that reality is a local difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same location . since the dialog has to use the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data at the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the shown card and can be set . select it again through , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the card can always be selected manually . the card can always be changed manually , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier Module is a tool to convert a number of images to a m@@ asch@@ au format in a m@@ asch@@ au format .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled on the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can use a background colour for the di@@ zi@@ au . with this module , it is possible to use the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD players . finally , you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images that are being packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards you can start the module with Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting of the images or contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to connect the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image is set below . a lower value produces very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth screen change . &quot;
&quot; the background colour may be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and the path of the generated file can be inserted under name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly or in all the rest of your needs , you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages on the right below . &quot;
&quot; the print assistant allows several pictures to print on a sheet of paper together . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Gim@@ p image format . this is for example , to improve you or using the Gim@@ p module for direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that there are the same results , as the software from your camera player . sometimes you get better results ! &quot;
&quot; first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and restart the module . the Ra@@ w image Converter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used as gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a Four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so you can use the contrast information . if your camera is working in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and store the conversion results . the file name remains equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss of loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Image Image Format , T@@ IFF , maintains all the information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before reaching the image quality . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file , the EX@@ IF file is stored in the EX@@ IF file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use it off . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ acking mode allows you to convert different pictures to once . use this mode therefore if you are sure , e.g. through testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if these have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview of Pro@@ gress is not available , how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming of all images of a record . you can set the pre@@ fix , start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the stamp . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it is used to use the upgrade program from Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can sc@@ roll the image , or enlarge . for this purpose , four types of image change are provided : &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the picture will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 wires ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print solution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background colour will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of winning images in advance . more pictures can be found on the list of winning images and lay there . &quot;
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window with the selected images displayed . via the button images , you can add more pictures with a file extension dialog . for the last selected image , a preview on the right side will be displayed . &quot;
you can also draw pictures to the picture list and place there in order to add images to the list of images .
&quot; to remove images , select the selected pictures from the list of the images added to the images . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all images , you can open the new message window of your E @-@ Mail Kli@@ pper . you only need to add the addresses and the subject line . these images are added to you as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it may be possibly a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send many pictures . &quot;
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for the sending of the images . your configuration is stored and once again uses them to change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , then you have to specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the choice of comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images into a text file and added to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format below the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it should be best adjusted among the los@@ s@@ less formats like T@@ IFF . therefore , you should not be modified P@@ NG if you want to have a fast internet connection , and the photo quality would not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; when you select JPEG image format , select the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the preferred images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed , so you can automatically view the status reports , looking for errors . your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end . with the button you can throw this window ? en . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to see your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose here between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL screen option is activated very elegant , using Open@@ GL using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the Di@@ asch@@ au will be very slowly . &quot;
the file name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop control loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then go manually with Es@@ c .
&quot; the option to random@@ ly select the pictures in random order , so the images will be used in random order . so it is not used to order the pictures in the album . &quot;
&quot; at delay between the pictures , the time interval between the pictures may be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should be out before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses another effect with each transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool bar on the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner around you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar , you can start the presentation and restart , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the di@@ zi@@ au . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set up a picture as background image for the surface area .
&quot; this module sets up the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ men@@ ü@@ s , as background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have finished your pictures and videos with remarks , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo album ; see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , so in each group , so in people , places and in group keyword entries are available . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories , for which you have entered information as you have received your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk , and of course , the current image images are described . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser has changed . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the pictures are displayed , on which both people are shown . through this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few more images . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen all those , locations and other settings , you can view images to watch the images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , every person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for every person , the same applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined yourself . see also the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images in addition to the name , select the button on the right outside of the tool bar . please note that you can choose the view for each category separately . that &apos;s the advantage that you can view images with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keyword ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to set up the image for each individual person . to view this , you &apos;ll need to select the image editor ( in closer detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the context window , you can select the enlargement factor according to your wishes and therefore select which part of the picture will be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you find in the main window in the entry , you will display a dialog , which is very similar to dialogue for fixed the image properties . this dialog can take a look at the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string in the field labelling or description , you can also enter a date or descriptions of the images according to this text , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , there will be images , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo album , but if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als but rather like to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and watch the fast @-@ up , screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; click on the first dialog . in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; click on the first time , or choose the menu entry to photo@@ album ; - Demo . as a result , some sample images are loaded , and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ Album ; as a connected HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this glue can be seen here : . as the name suggests , these bodies tell you date information about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display you several different time units . each LEICA shows a different unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bodies only 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the time bar allows you to use in the following ways : you can change the shown entries preview of the database ( if you select a date , the time frame will always show the current date of the currently shown images , if you will navigate in preview of preview ) . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . you can cancel the selection , by clicking on a beam of the time bar . &quot;
&amp; photo album : you can create two options to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other as module is available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create about the HTML menu file ...
&quot; before HTML pages have to be created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and goal . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the over@@ looks and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on the photo album ; HTML sample pages , you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , which will be created on the over@@ sight page . watch information about export files you will find in . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information will be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , all images are exported . therefore , you can not use this attitude to hide certain pictures from particular viewing . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the setup possibilities are unique , which is why not specifically made . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the pictures . therefore , those who have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , for example , to download a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; viewing your site can change the resolution at any time . so , it can therefore change your pictures with a lower resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as well . if he would like to receive a picture greater , it changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this installation area , place the different folders and the URL , where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a basic file for all of your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main file in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can verify that these really are all visible to viewers . if you have created a URL for the basic file , a web browser after the pages have been created . otherwise , the URL , you should start this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them manually . so that the import function , see , right , you must specify the final goal of files , but the basic file in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the just described setup possibilities have been included all three on basic folders , or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is laid out , whose name is set in output file . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re looking forward to a family party , meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you may want to create a HTML page to viewing the pictures , recording , etc . if you already have a lot of time to look at the pictures , recording , etc . , you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then you do not have to do this work again . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photo album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other in your database . the image properties will be imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the pictures yourself be stored in the file , or if the file is stored in the file , that you can share all pictures into the file , but the obvious down@@ side is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is searching for images in two ways . first , the images that are displayed in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file are searched , this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for Export Pictures is described , which allows you to export the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should act in internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three selection options are available : &quot;
&quot; at option Manu@@ ally , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic option to copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ Album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this nevertheless , simply select the export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is lim@@ iting the highest image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you may want to limit the pictures maybe not in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can say that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file stimul@@ us ... select , is &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database is described as described in . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import@@ antly consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you can person@@ alise the category people to the imported file ( if you are a D@@ ena ) , while this category is asked with your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window which are to be imported to which categories are to be imported into your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example will see you on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be simple to browse pictures and watch : when you see images , you want to view images often within different images groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to discover pictures of your Italy vacation rentals and a picture with your friend , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will run the various steps from the ( 1 ) review of information on your pictures , above ( 2 ) the search and look ahead , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ ting possibilities . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual is spoken about images , but often this includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo album ; stores all his information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , you can copy to a disk or revisions in CV@@ S , you can . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo album : remember the folder , stored in which your images are stored and use this in future Star@@ ts . if you want to start another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; on the menu entry settings , set up a photo album ; enter a window with which you can change the settings from &amp; photo album ; in the following section of the user book , you will discuss the various setup possibilities . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can set up the options for viewing and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed assistance is available , you can access the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described as you can create various features for each image , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialog box , which is used to have already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a labelling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , all members of a group , rather than in a group , instead of all groups of a mid@@ fiel@@ der . &quot;
&quot; you can see the setup possibilities that are available to you for determining the members groups . with the top selection list , you can configure the category you want to configure . in the left window , a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; with other graphic applications , K@@ IP@@ I and G@@ DE is shared with other graphics applications such as di@@ gi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ preview . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plug@@ in interface . feed information on this website of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called upon the modules . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; photo album ; however , most modules have a help @-@ page that you can call on the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules from multiple applications are used together , it can be that the modules test with &amp; photo album ; so you can always test new modules first with the Demo Database , before you can call this on your own pictures - demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I in common are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo album are not functioning ; this is the dis@@ advantage , if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ Album ; this type of order does not support , sim@@ ulates the order for albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; photo album . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulates &amp; photo album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , i.e. all images that shows you the picture shows . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ Album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums , as follows : &quot;
&quot; when &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; if you have defined the category for virtual albums , you will be used as a category for virtual albums , so if you would like to choose the Category 2 category , so if you have selected individuals to view and continue the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; photo album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select the modules , which modules are to be charged . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , as soon as you head &amp; photo album , start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window that you don &apos;t have any information about your images . in the section we will display you on this window , now click on this window , which shows you an overview of all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is the possibility to view any image with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture where the picture has been shown separately or for a larger number of images at the same time . if shown on all pictures Jes@@ per , and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and brows@@ ing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by using people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album , as you can always use them if you are using information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on the pictures of the pictures within the list : if you have shown for example a family party , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depicted , you can find that the names are shi@@ fted upwards , the individuals can find faster and arrange them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabetical list , click on the symbol for sorting according to date below . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen notes for each image individually , you may possibly have to edit all selected images and read these pictures with notes . Click this case simply click on the front and back @-@ buttons , which are below the preview of the picture right above . &quot;
&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and to use the menu option multiple entries to once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a transition group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the dialog@@ s , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also send an entry into a category and place there to sort this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the command @-@ dialog@@ s by removing the bodies that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by setting it out of the window area outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , you can click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also get a frame completely out . if you would like to receive this window again later , use the button options ... and then here window a / aus@@ end . this process you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in your browser , you will receive an overview of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have filters here . for example , you can see the size of the image images using the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply once . &quot;
&quot; if you have an image in the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a picture , this picture will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the picture show . simply delete the corresponding image from which you want to delete , and select either the removal button or select in the menu Edit menu . now you will display the window , which you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo album : you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the photos stored on the hard disk . in the picture you &apos;ll need to record the pictures from &amp; photo album , so you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ Album ; if not all required pictures of the hard disk can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , these images can be shown in pictures 1 @-@ 9 , but you can view this pictures with the picture viewer . you can also view this picture with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see this function , you need to copy files from the folders and to copy it again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ Album ; if you want to avoid the inser@@ tion of your images , please buy a bigger hard drive to store all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , you will filter the images that you can see for other un@@ accessible and click on the latest view menu . alternatively , you can also view all images that can be able to view your little sister , check the menu entry everything except current view . &quot;
&quot; thus , you have set what images will be hidden in case of the case . if you want to lock the laptop now your little sister , you simply select the menu entry , which you have locked out . if you want to get the pictures below , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to determine a password , which must be entered into the locking of the images . to set this password , select password Change in the privacy . &quot;
&quot; please do remember that this image protection is no longer safe . to a one you can read or delete all pictures on the hard drive and to the other , anyone can read the password as an un@@ encrypted text , only to those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view to private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and hours about hours to describe it is natural , of course you want to look at some point . from this reason you have a photo _ and video viewer . this can be seen from preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; viewing the viewer you can see in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag the mouse and see if any information is displayed . all these options are displayed after a right click on the viewer . this then , the context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and back by using the buttons picture high and bottom . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then you can press a new picture after a few seconds . as often , a new picture can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus the button . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ Album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch back into full screen mode .
if you use the viewer you can use in the image and get out in the image . using the Min@@ us button you can print out a button . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom back into the middle of the picture . shows as a zoom @-@ rectangle and shows the result of the zo@@ oming .
&quot; with the point key , you can reset your zoom so that the picture is not drawn to zo@@ omed . with the balance sheet the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is on the screen &apos;s pixel . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work on videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
&quot; with the shooting features from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu option remarks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you &apos;ll have to put on the image . in the moment you can view the image and configuration dialog box to mark this name , but you may prefer to mark the picture and see more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures , and check it as good or bad , while you can view one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features , while you can view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can view a feature that you can print the corresponding letters . in view , you can see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can copy a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD , or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particularly features can be shown in the presentation view . if you can view categories in DR@@ E presentation view , then you can press features to the images by clicking on the picture after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; photo album ; on the image .
&quot; the painted old will not be saved with the image , but in the database . you can re@@ use your old later back later . &quot;
you can see a picture on the painted picture . to switch the painting from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting you simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top on the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; work , you need to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub@@ object of a already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object @-@ tree , select the position where you want to add the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are multi @-@ possible positions , which ends the following drop down menu , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; if you delete the menu bar either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ear to adopt these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , a message appears with an error description . then you can report the input and check the changes with ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation does not contain in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture , or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of the Property View . &quot;
&quot; press a preview of the scene with the chosen texture and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . if you want to ren@@ ame a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example , a texture in a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the screen photo shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of camera .
&quot; if a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation than also the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
each object has as a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the level of level or absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the scene chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the default window , or if you need another arrangement , you can easily store it any . you can also save several window arrangements , and easily change between various arrangements . &quot;
&quot; in order to em@@ bedding a window over or below a view , drag the link to the top or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the link to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view , stretching over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the attachment to another view . you can then switch between the views on the box guides above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the attachment to the desktop or click on the small left above pointing arrow in the attachment bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the Little Cross in the Com@@ preh@@ ensive bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views to the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are shy , you can anchor it in any spot . &quot;
&quot; the current window view , you can save with view window arrangement ... store it . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be installed correctly . as this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool bar or choose the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s In@@ i files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can easily insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender , click the Tool@@ bar or in the menu of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be open : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , but sensible is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can insert the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ dering only one small area of the picture , select the check box section and enter the picture section to ren@@ dering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination of combination , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflective photoelectric sensor . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture is taken with only one beam per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ b effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these mistakes . generally , pictures with this feature is better . &quot;
&quot; if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and links &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is still divided and adap@@ tive because of the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray is a beam of pixels . if the difference between the color values will be adjusted to the limit value , both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with a value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be tra@@ ced individually and further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion . it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this feature . &quot;
&quot; on this card map , you can adjust whether the alpha @-@ channels should be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays are not met . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; - console edition . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file ... and choose a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers are currently supported ; yet not the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support the source in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object @-@ tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects into the scene file . to import objects into the scene , just mark the source text in the editor , and drag him into the object . &quot;
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also add the source for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ed ; a scene ren@@ dering . usually this is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
&quot; if you click on the help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your documentation and the version . now , versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example altitude fel@@ ine ) in the paths to den &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not included in the scene file , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path to these files . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first file is used . &quot;
the colour for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected check points .
the colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characteristic .
&quot; you can adjust the points of points on the grid in the context menu of the open @-@ model views . you can set the root separately for shifts , scal@@ ings and turns . &quot;
&quot; larger values show a more precise wire model and thus ensuring better nails for the shown objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering it . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross High details for extended projec@@ tions , all wire model views are further divided when the camera is using a extended projection . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions of perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is depicted in a box pattern from two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is shown in a box pattern from two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you cross edge production , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering the scenes is used . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section window arrangements , you can create and store windows . &quot;
the combination field standard window layout : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of manu@@ als features all existing window arrangements . you can add a new arrangement with the button , and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot;
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
&quot; the list below the name shows all the views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can add to the button , and delete selected views with the button . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with un@@ folded windows to the existing window , with card card , you get a flash@@ card view along with the previous view , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; now install and now want to follow these steps . if you follow all steps in this manual , you should make the ultimate but easy scene : a ball on a plane . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider following war@@ nings should be careful before you compl@@ ain that you can only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied , as a result , you will receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you add no light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark , and you will only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything faul@@ t@@ lessly installed , you will see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; the following pre @-@ set window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so you can get a reasonable introduction to what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will often need to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols , and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object . select the scene and then select the menu entry . therefore , you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the open model view shows how the camera is considered the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice it in the fourth wire @-@ model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the scene . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when clicking on it , you &apos;ll see the contents of the view properties tab in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera can change in the view point , with which you can change the camera on a control point and drag him to the desired spot . &quot;
&quot; when you press the button or press the input button , the wire model views and the lenses can immediately conform to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene , for example , you could insert a quota ( insert end@@ able body parts ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a constant method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; in fact it offers a simpler opportunity . you can use an infinite level as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button App@@ ear , or the button . in the object @-@ tree , the new name is instantly displayed . &quot;
&quot; the open model , also shows the plain , although at the moment only a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane extends down to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you check out the object of the object , you &apos;ll notice that you can click the entry for the floor . in this case , you can only click the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the object &apos;s list . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move a unit to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just allow you to know some of these parameters . select a shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to set out its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select the object in the object . you can view the name in the property view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button . see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a m@@ apped black material because you can check settings for the pig@@ ment . so , do not think that you can check the appearance of materials anytime with a click of preview . also there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est . &quot;
&quot; if you see no color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the colour scheme . here are further settings needed . in the colour list you &apos;ll need to select two new attributes , called . select this entry twice ( you can also be more common , but the Schach@@ brett @-@ Far@@ ben@@ list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object @-@ tree every time , select the colors in the object &apos;s view : &quot;
this step you should already run simply because you should have the basic working mode of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; already understood . the ball can be just as easy as to create :
&quot; in view of the objects , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the button or push the button ) , so the ball would ho@@ ver down the ground as you have moved the floor to down a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now makes a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball @-@ surface is like a m@@ ash black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now point a material now . as in the bottom , type a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose the first sub@@ object , and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . Click on sphere pig@@ ment , then select insert and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input .
&quot; the settings brightness effect and reflection are already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of it , which possibilities you have &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; hopefully , you have already learned as much as you can create simple but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ red a scene from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera which reflects the scenes ) by any pixel in the scene , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can effect as a fog . so the scene is processed for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye to see the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be prevented , some light sources and at least a camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY file usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; open a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest record in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ produces the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage has been rejected .
you can only select this menu option if you still haven &apos;t saved changes in the scene .
&quot; for this menu entry , you can only select this menu entry . then you can only select if you have used editing . &quot;
&quot; stores the current window arrangement , and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; here you can change the looks , the keyboards and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut , you can add pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; -@@ commands , or add new orders . &quot;
opens a dialog to setup the tool . you can add using this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; add orders and remove commands .
&quot; a B@@ ump Map is an option to avoid rough surfaces , without changing any B@@ eu@@ le on the surface individually and without change the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump Map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; the basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be processed further to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using an image file as color card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable portrait and web browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures .
pictures can be displayed either in one own window in size of the image or in full screen mode .
use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; it is very simple . the file browser lists files you can click on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key Return .
&quot; you can adjust whether any image will be displayed in your own window , or if all the images are always using the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , select the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . when a password fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog insert - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation and short commands for the browser , the keys can be specified for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour , which you can further adjust . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still have the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option , stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; by sending the name of the last opened file . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show opens ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the screen of screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; cu@@ ff@@ show ; so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
this option is enlarged for large pictures the display window on the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
determines if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the period between the screen change in a slide show . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repet@@ itions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated as long as it is canc@@ eled by the user . to use the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . &quot;
&quot; here , change the keys for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short command for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , turn between the two @-@ part of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot;
displays great symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
shows demonstration models for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short display .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .

&quot; &amp; Tru@@ l@@ ite ; it &apos;s a simple application to scan images that will no longer make it better than pictures , and save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display images in front of the store . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by checking the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels ; with the command W@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not open , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog will be open to the scanner . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner , select and press OK to open the scanner . stop off &amp; wi@@ z@@ l@@ ite ; end . &quot;
the further settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Tru@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not particularly useful .
&quot; to trace a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ copy and then select scanning range for final scan . the preview can be launched by preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , the user can navigate into the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview of the window fits . &quot;
&quot; if the picture was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when on the Save a preview display is selected in the settings , the picture will be shown in a presentation window , as shown below . when storing is pressed , then the picture is saved and ch@@ lie ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button Settings , the ep@@ onymous dialogue is opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here . &quot;
&quot; users can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview of user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; channels ; image stores to select the dialog for each image , open the dialog in front of each one @-@ called image . if &amp; Tru@@ l@@ ite ; automatically select the dialog in a previously defined folder , then you must be able to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame file . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images can be saved without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as standard for dialog to save . the default value is your home directory , and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically save images , and is additionally added to the proposed name for the image in dialogue . the automatically stored picture will be uploaded any time when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; users can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; channels ; the button above will start the K@@ DE over @-@ dialog for &amp; channels ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; channels .
&quot; the GP@@ L is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; channels ; please refer to L@@ GP@@ L . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs keyboards . below you will find a list of these pump@@ kin and their function . you can set up a list of short@@ cuts in the Player window and select Global keyboards . select the &amp; amar@@ ok button . select the right mouse button in the Player window and select short commands .
&quot; you may also setup your multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok , and make your keyboard to the &amp; amar@@ ok ; control centre . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ Interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP @-@ function break might be &amp; z@@ b ; like this : &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok the command @-@ sharing options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok also has some own command @-@ sharing options . &quot;
&quot; should the user give a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a lack of limitations . please check in your script , whether all required modules are available and use a dialog to enable the user to know why a script will not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the scripts / Tem@@ plates you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can quickly find them as base for your own scripts or simply use the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts data using amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should contain any K@@ DE installation .
&quot; most of the scripts are possible to execute external programs and commands , and usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) can be called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively easy to be called . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default setting and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure . configure the script to view the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the working folder on the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ ck@@ change indicates that a new piece will be staged . the script might now query &amp; b ; with D@@ COP functions , further information about the new piece ( for example , met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title &#93; are given to select the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , if a customized menu entry may be selected . to remove one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to complete the installation process , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages which can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be seen with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept script packages with the extension of amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages like correctly .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang up to the Wik@@ i scripts page by &amp; amar@@ ok . apply for your entry to K@@ DE apps you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; amar@@ ok , you can just pull music into the play@@ list instead of endless menus . maybe you can only find a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can find a collection for collecting brows@@ ers and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you would like to hear ? then , the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if you &apos;re still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music for certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . this and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you need to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok , the basic file of the Amar@@ ok sources : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; amar@@ ok , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake should be used , you should have no difficulty with comp@@ ile . if you encounter problems , please report these in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; as most applications have a few options to enable or dis@@ able to comp@@ ile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies have to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating deb@@ ug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; amar@@ ok , you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can be set without effort via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok .
&quot; players windows turn on the Player window in addition to the play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed . &quot;
&quot; tuning : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok has been compiled ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switches to the experimental function of the mood ometer . &quot;
shap@@ ing : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok has been compiled ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar it has been modified for m@@ ood@@ bar .
tuning files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok . if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files are stored on the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser by &amp; amar@@ ok is to be started when a browser is required .
&quot; other brows@@ ers : here , you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list . &quot;
&quot; play@@ list when saving , stores the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored . &quot;
&quot; current piece of replacement parts are visible , that the play@@ list window opens up / off , in order to keep track of each running time in the visible window range . &quot;
&quot; when changing to the context @-@ browser , automatically changes the context @-@ browser when the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section image you can adjust &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is in three sections .
&quot; in the font section , you can adjust the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can choose fon@@ ts for the following section : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ brows@@ ers . you can select scripts in the following areas : select play@@ list windows , player windows and context @-@ brows@@ ers . press on select ... , so you can select a written font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you yourself have the Qu@@ al of choice and can define their own color scheme . use these activated color selection for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; starting at the start , we do that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after finishing the play , play automatically with the piece at this point , with which it has been stopped at the final end . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to display on the O@@ SD card . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . Click on select ... to select from dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD , which will display the text contained in the O@@ SD . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ll use the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color surfaces open the dialog for color selection . if the colors are not activated , the default &amp; K@@ DE will be used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display shows the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by the type of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to set on what monitor is to appear a multi @-@ fold monitor environment .
&quot; the card card audio output , you can select an audio driver from the sel@@ ector . some drivers are able to activate additional adjustment possibilities in this box card . &quot;
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can choose the folder , select &amp; amar@@ ok , to search music files . in order to include a folder inside the collection , select the check boxes next to its name . this section also includes anch@@ ors to insert , as with selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder Brow@@ se Brow@@ se : this causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folder to music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists : causes , that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) will be added to your collection later , later in play@@ lists brows@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the part Colle@@ ctors database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : can be selected between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , further facility in the sub@@ window of MySQL is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the MySQL database is used for setting the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator , the computer database is installed on which the MySQL database is provided , under which the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is manufactured . &quot;
use us@@ ername : and password : to input data that are needed for connection to the database .
the card last@@ .@@ f@@ m sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current unit .
&quot; here , enter your user name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send out pieces and upgrade the profile : this setting allows it &amp; amar@@ ok , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting is retri@@ eved &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to each play played . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
&quot; am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you need to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the included programs , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to comp@@ ile e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have a small guide how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD is predic@@ ting that your window manager is holding the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , for example , Flu@@ x@@ box will therefore prepare difficulties . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files will have a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can view this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang out the en@@ cap@@ te file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , it is important that Tag@@ li@@ b read from this file &apos;s read @-@ information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re using MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; amar@@ ok , is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; amar@@ ok , used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , e.g. &amp; amar@@ ok , with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , turn off machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail address itself automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash , and you will be fixed to us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is in mind that many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 as UTF @-@ 8 , but this is not known as Unicode code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ _ v@@ 2@@ tag &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; , &quot; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / Dynamic play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can simply click the icons and click on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases up to three times you can click on a symbol until this setting can display its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app symbol : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ marked symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ Systems Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map . you can see whether am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Un@@ amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to solve this error , you possibly have to remove any col@@ li@@ vel@@ ing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust that am@@ aro@@ K is the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are easiest to find your uni@@ x or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or using the developers . use this forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only wear a bug giving you something to the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; appears only a blank play@@ list . how do music come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window is converted into the statistics window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the importance of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; in the play@@ list , please click on the list of play@@ list and select column settings . Click anywhere in the new evaluation column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button to your selection and then choose from play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would like to make it with other files . so easy is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the button , the button is play@@ list . Click on it . &quot;
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package and install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package and re@@ install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look even after lib@@ ations this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .

&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may be ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which the default no MP3 decoder can be supplied with default ( for pat@@ ent@@ aries ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ sa driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . check out the D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the edition of this command should help you search for the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must be encoded first . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a dec@@ or with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it , and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also supports the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control centre sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is adjusted : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs , which can cause local playback . read this error report . the En@@ large Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts drivers , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts drivers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analysis ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less orders react , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I would like to change the driver driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( termin@@ ate am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - load m@@ peg down , comp@@ ile and install it . then execute G@@ ST regi@@ sters , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . delete the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config file and then run G@@ ST @-@ register . start now &amp; amar@@ ok . &quot;

&quot; basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a rounded value based on how many times the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has each individual assessment on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can click the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button in the play@@ list window . then mark your rating . then you can click the evaluation of a piece button on the piece and edit : evaluate , select or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation of a piece of met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;

&quot; exclu@@ de all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each of the stored project is asked , what should be done , as if you had called a file . &quot;
&quot; if you call this entry , you can submit files to the project . this has the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files are added in the base file of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the features dialog box . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . the burning dialog can only be open when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can find many projects @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry is only available in an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it &apos;s more useful for you to see the files already existing files and folders . &quot;
&quot; this entry is only available in an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature set up &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also only copy a picture of a CD instead of normal head . you should also want to copy cl@@ oning when you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; it also gives the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create copying a DVD on another medium . alternatively , you can also only support a DVD with the help of copying dialog . furthermore , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source in the original form . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . thus , you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between the write modes . &quot;
&quot; it is bur@@ ns to burn an earlier CD image . the dialog is available after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file , which then can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported , for this , you must use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously designed DVD image . the dialog asks you to be burned immediately after a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can be burnt immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; an earlier DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anyway . it contains information about the selected video , coding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information on the pic@@ kled medium . these information are presented in the content view and include properties of the media , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small body at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view turns on or off . the folder view is displayed an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is activated , their content will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media info , locks and locking of the drive or dis@@ card of the media . &quot;
&quot; the contents view is one or out . the content view allows to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also selected to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder . &quot;
&quot; the hard@@ working in the project view is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the project view has open projects . the di@@ ligent has no real function , it looks just pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands are selected in the upper part , you can adjust the key arrangement below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; alignment assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions are required for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , therefore you must enter the password for the server manager ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . nearly all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is designed to person@@ alise and to create the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in functional scope , therefore it is rather your taste and the type of tasks that is crucial to give you the default programs . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then , enter something like the following console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; programme have common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can obtain a project via the command line using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b features the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface that is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; cre@@ denti@@ als ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String , ) , add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String , ) and add@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ String path ) , ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) , ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String , name ) , offset volume ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script generates a data project , several folders , and then adds files into the new folder : &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; card reader for &amp; K@@ DE ; with it can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the encoder &apos;s encoder installed on the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator : is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many co@@ als which are encoded using these WAV files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . more co@@ als can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format , or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ als are already available , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile anything yourself . however , only if F@@ LA@@ C is not used , it is not necessary for example F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; which coding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out of audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to handle any cop@@ ier protection ; it is not possible to handle the mechanisms of copying protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protection CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once again ( the setup dialog can be found so often called up to a suitable configuration ) , after the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads to the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to comprehen@@ sion for the slim approach of the user interface , which you can often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; can get information from Free@@ D@@ b from the internet or can fully work without network , whereby everything is collected manually . &quot;
&quot; this is only a short list of commands of the main window . on the page , for example , further information , such as this program will be used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program for configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB starts on request of the CD data according to the setup of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made the connection to the internet . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if a encoder is configured in the Registry tab - the encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of the available encoder , so that the option with another encoder can be read as the standard . it is to note that before the encoder in the tab card configured in the tab dialog . &quot;
&quot; opening the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected to be encoded instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and add . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as check the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as encoder , to set up the en@@ code ) . go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ hes@@ itation , compression rates and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is required , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , which lose information through data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important because both co@@ als are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG easily deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG fil@@ s are present .
&quot; MP3 - If music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these tools mostly support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex musical pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . well done for music by teenagers , portable devices and auto@@ ster@@ e@@ o@@ ists . but not good enough for better stereo systems facilities . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute top quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that can be entered manually or replaced by the program automatically from Free@@ D@@ b on the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used by using &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the coding program to create folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of programming settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the code explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to be encoded with lame ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s must be encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters which can be used ( = Kn@@ op@@ f@@ itter in Assi@@ stance ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all other information can be downloaded ( instead of text ) : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , names of the Pi@@ eces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( the author of the name ) am not attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so it can not be added to the artist nor the music business . all information can be saved with a bo@@ wel by a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; it is active to choose a check box ( sending an address ) . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address can not be used by server using the server ( This can only know the programm@@ ers who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; for use of Free@@ D@@ b , the ge@@ ographic will be used on the nearest mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirror servers for online check of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which user program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first if this is not yet done .
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the co@@ di@@ ers and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the first time , pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss of loss for audio data ) and F@@ LA@@ C can be added on this tab card . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . more information about co@@ di@@ ers are located in the Ko@@ di@@ erer chapter .
&quot; following the installation of a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information can be obtained via the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . in doing so , &apos; lame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check out the device @-@ name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read real and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is installed as well as the audio co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . that could give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a note about what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a step with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , it can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but somehow they are not going to do anything ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all started and read our first &amp; CD ; we will be &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure the directory / us@@ r / share / cd consists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by copying with the Con@@ quer@@ or something inside ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ze , something which probably is done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for each finishing &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
here we determine the using co@@ di@@ ers for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting tone quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy to use the Free@@ D@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them in any pron@@ unci@@ ation &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is given to the readable program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or when it can be accessed using other programs , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card General Settings . here you can &apos;t do a lot . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is shown / entered as shown on display photo . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information please select , so you will be informed if information about the witness of keyword ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download on the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b machine .
note : this calcul@@ ator has to be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Free@@ D@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , will be a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately if you &apos;re not satisfied with the database @-@ entry and the resulting directory entry , or the file name , and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , further notice : if you would like to set everything manually , check the select fields and Free@@ D@@ b is not used . however , this is over 620 MB large , considering the two sel@@ ector fields , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; as does the system , which data will get the CD ? read the section above Free@@ D@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen photo . &quot;
&quot; mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to side fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , looking for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load will be distributed between the machines . however , this attitude will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equal to the server since but many fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly bo@@ oming , there might be more fortunate with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf in the internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want to transmit &amp; CD ; data on the Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check box should be dis@@ able .
just take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the file / tmp does exist on your computer )
&quot; number of ad@@ jec@@ ting pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore try it . &quot;
CDs . to read out of the last piece : cruci@@ fy this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you are logged into this file , the path must be stored in which the WAV files are stored . if you don &apos;t have any space on another drive . if you don &apos;t miss this file , you don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to make something with WAV files . &quot;
&quot; just type how it is on the screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under the circumstances must be flo@@ cked to the right , to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ . it reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later change of tags : ( including the complete path ) and output file ( including the complete path ) .
use the rest as in picture photo . some comments for future use outside this sample :
&quot; number of co@@ ils to WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be encoded simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ding ; it is used as a standard for each output of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive is described and set up . first , a connection to the internet is described , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ D@@ b want to pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each ad@@ missible &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we are using a &amp; CD ; you don &apos;t use it in Free@@ D@@ b , the screen photos will see a little different than those for one &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; you will get the data manually , instead of using them from the Internet . comments are to be submitted to the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this sample is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD is now ; into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD , could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not happening , you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully managed by the Free@@ D@@ b , all tracks are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database @-@ entry that your opinion is best on your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the check box for the automatic query from Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the Settings ) , you can also manually redeem it manually due to the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you need access to the Internet . &quot;
&quot; e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - entry of the CD data , and the title of the first piece &quot;
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; top@@ ical title &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must not be entered in the &apos; Update Title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the bottom line field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ , ell per piece , the comment box of the album will be used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful cancellation of the data from Free@@ D@@ b is not blank , but it contains already a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you do not only start with the artist and album names , but also to check whether there are any undes@@ ired comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you want ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags : this option is set up on the code card code ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later , with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ als or file formats . see in the help of the co@@ aster to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which seem obvious with the style of the selected CD ; this example is not important as we do the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . just click on line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD Edit@@ ors appears again and you see that the fields for the album already filled with the given data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the piece of play in every case and other information you wish . &quot;
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all title data of &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the denomin@@ ation list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ out before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected so marked . a simple click on the line switches , or make the button all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on the button on the button sel@@ reading process , this window appears to confirm . on OK , then we will look at a look at the window with the entries and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; Click on the tab , switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar . &quot;
this is the window to control your orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message , if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ ter you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the contract list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the file for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have writing access to the temporary files and target folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to the format MP3 . thus , read and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program does not find configuration settings to read this behavior . the only thing that configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the machine used with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and coding ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is encoded and a third order in the waiting long of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ zation ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; today , you can download an anonymous copy of your distribution today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S is part of a compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package is already a pre @-@ compiled package as well . if you read this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons , compiled by source files , and not intended for users to use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; one program calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . best to read the options for step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different flash@@ cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked on the first time of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program starts at the time is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t fix this manual page . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ding , may it do . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has to leave this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange when you managed to get the source file from the &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ er von &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition to others , he has not have a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ line lighting of texts also some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players did not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support too . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is supported as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity every MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can go to &amp; K@@ DE ; each MIDI file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window to K@@ Mid can move .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or tex@@ tures ) .
&quot; support support . if you end &amp; K@@ DE ; finish during the play of a song , K@@ mid starts next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first you can open ... from the menu file . it &apos;s the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also make a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and sque@@ eze the button on the tool@@ bar , select the record copy from the menu , or select the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , once you start it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window pull . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played next to each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any spot by using the medium mouse button and drive them with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template &apos;s speed . to get back the original pace , double click on Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , it works on the space bar like a print on the button break or select the menu entry break in the menu , interrup@@ ts the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play playback . &quot;
song lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces are using tex@@ turing and others use lyrics and others . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed automatically , and even better : the event type is automatically determined to change the song settings , so you will always have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the menu Settings menu , or sun@@ ba@@ the events . the same feature also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ize . these are recorded in the row . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , open the collection manager . here you can find in the menu collection under the point . Click here on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired collection in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; into the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; in leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . remember when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collections manager . again , you can add a song with the button . again , the file dialog appears , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting automatic add to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece will be added automatically to the active collection ( using File opening , drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song , then click on Rem@@ ov@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the sequence in which the songs will be played . if you select the row after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs in the order were played , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list on the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the button prior to previous piece from the menu or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter if it is not stored in leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is necessarily necessary for syn@@ thesizer which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events into events that understands syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that saves all required changes for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map ... End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) , and end that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , that I may be in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the DC sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in correct sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and do not leave line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all the tones that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can do a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which can be similar to a ri@@ fle ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which allows you to do the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; if now , a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( ri@@ fle signal ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the concept drum patch of the patch is meant by each tone a different per@@ cus instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the pitch the pitch of the same drum ( like some keyboards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you must only use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the per@@ col@@ on channel . check out as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to share the first and second channel , do it simply in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; in this case , the keyboard is used on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be defined using the name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , you will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch is used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to always use the per@@ col@@ t patch on the Per@@ k@@ al channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied . if so , a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event , and then it is only for@@ warded to the value of 40@@ 96 , so that in the Map file there will be no dec@@ imal number . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM is going to play a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event , with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some keyboards up to a oct@@ ave higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you &apos;ll need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the canal view is a window with a whole set of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these grounds , you &apos;ll see which sounds are just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can change an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t display green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the canal view has ( until now ) two different views to show the played sounds . view , select the Settings menu below the point edge view : settings &quot;
&quot; the Tempo LCD shows the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the larger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the temp@@ o , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the same MIDI file to very different results , just like two different musicians able to play the same notes on very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary program ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to remove the problem , you need to download and install a source code ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can see the arrow buttons on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
&quot; I have to switch on a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way , I need to play a kar@@ aoke file , or I want to play a file ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) , or I want to play a file in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file only quickly , without taking them equal to a collection , turn the setting automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let us assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. don &apos;t want to play the first file . so , set the setup automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then includes exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then , you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you make it ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or the postcard , anim@@ ates me this , keep on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the third year I am in the third year , so I &apos;m not trying to take me a little time . as Hob@@ bies I &apos;m trying to collect MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write to me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org , or ant@@ iso@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a giant , if you send me a postcard from your residence or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who want to send a postcard or a MIDI file , but you should contact me as a MIDI file , but you should contact me as I may have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and not get money from anyone . I would therefore emphas@@ ize that I &apos;m only going to be pro@@ gram@@ ed because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - Beh@@ eb@@ ung of the error that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .

&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net , which give us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which can look at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ ky pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if you are problems , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files that supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD or TV and camera . &quot;
documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; K@@ DE ; on this calcul@@ ator has been installed .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or the question about The &amp; K@@ DE ; User mailing list . &quot;
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is displayed in it .
&quot; it is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ arch@@ ical level . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups is copied to the current category and the play begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; News &apos; , Television and Permanent play@@ list can also be changed through direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; you can simply click on a name for a category click here and next post mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content will display this part . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu must be selected with play@@ list and select either the processing mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost when the processing mode leave , or any other group is selected without the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the author of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation during the starting and end can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c and modify &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present you can simply be inserted .
it &apos;s also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation while Star@@ ts doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will be automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . however , this would be distur@@ bing a second time at the end of animation . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; SM@@ G : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; in directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a tab on configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache @-@ size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured via manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the d@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module .
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
&quot; in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player can be displayed as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file extensions from K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consol@@ es application and after error messages related to the store of the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end edition inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; this is always a given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on will play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be checked , the scanner can be configured to use or the configuration file , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog can be found in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . you should be found out of which one has to be selected . for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contain a DVB @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; as the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video , it should also work on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension refers to the X server . therefore , the video server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; intern@@ ally , these sources are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources of various names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ ce , t@@ v@@ ec@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ ec@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ ec@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ ec@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ ec@@ our@@ ce , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; is there indications how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive lou@@ der , if I play from it ( not of the VCD : / / ) ? &quot;
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is designed as a user root according to the device . it is sure to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine only starts slowly and why does my CPU need to be tested for their performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ h@@ ed@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphic user interfaces and network support and is required to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . using Unix @-@ like systems is probably used on the package &amp; tex@@ tures ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be used for the installation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ ile and are included in the k@@ ile ; -@@ web site .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation included . is the support for this project or documentation , the contact via the k@@ ile ; -@@ website should be manufactured . &quot;
questions regarding or to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are des@@ iring extensions should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; application area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the option for use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; - functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and tail@@ or @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; - for example , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn his possibilities , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin directly with reading the chapter Working with the Editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H . it is difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( English ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ macro@@ s . a less sophisticated but more realistic discretion is that it is from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; if you are given a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex here , it is not the ultimate book to do it . for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the same as other extension languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties such as paper format , side effects and text gra@@ ding with the text , contains at least the command \ \ , class , which starts with the command \ \ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a good feature for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some mo@@ wers for the compilation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : this will hereby be defined by the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , article &#91; Report &#93; , articles &#91; Report &#93; , articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ ell &#93; , Fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ it &#93; or user defined . &quot;
coding : this is how the character encoding is set . modern systems are used to use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if enabled , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most common extra package for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they only use only in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : document classes from Com@@ a Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the creation of German text . &quot;
new users are now not worried anymore . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information about this in the section .
&quot; it is - just like other source code Edit@@ ors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , att@@ itudes and elements ( as well as un@@ suitable ) . however , it is possible to find a simple trou@@ bles@@ hooting section on the screen . however , it will cost you through the modest appearance of output file . however , it will saves you through the modest appearance of output . &quot;
&quot; with automatic completion of environments , a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ command { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically produces a space ( for entering the text ) and the add @-@ in line to close the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be activated by La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the lowest and sub@@ cut@@ ters the lowest element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structural view , the single elements can be changed through a mouse click to the respective and viewed . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful , as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; rounded file format ) &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the medium mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ panel for the corresponding line in the lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information such as the font type &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , transformation and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and systems . &quot;
&quot; if you have cli@@ cked on a DVI ; file with the editor , the elements of the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked on an item in the lat@@ ex ; -@@ file spec@@ ts , which has been cli@@ cked on a section in the lat@@ ex ; file source , will be cli@@ cked to the appropriate section in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; Master document : this function is used in work with multiple files . using a master document , working with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master document can be set to project settings . &quot;
fast : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
&quot; file data : in this mode , the DVI ; file is based on the calculation of the unit , and it is not a call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; according to the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; looking at the editing tool bar , the three large @-@ printed selection fields should be developed . the first selection field is designed for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the sel@@ ective box is available for products such as tags , mer@@ ges , notes , or references . the examples are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name is created for a section , a picture or different element . &quot;
terms : will be used for reference to a fixed name ( selecting a selection field ) .
when using quote is indicated a selection list with literary entries . in &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; this only works if the file is required to create a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; can also be written by hand .
&quot; the last box , with the name of the background , will be used for the laying of the font . it can be set to the main text , the R notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling the &amp; k@@ ile , two sel@@ ections are available for verification : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document and setting of settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the cl@@ as@@ ps after the command \ \ , class contain the settings for the command . the font &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font to the beginning . if the font is not set at the beginning , it can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been entered , the lat@@ ex has to be compiled ; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the menu or the button . &quot;
the source code needs to be stored before comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; the compilation of the document should be found in the log@@ ging after the errors . when using fast construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an area ( English @-@ environment ) is a text that will be different from the remaining document . for example , a few fon@@ ts should have been created and just a few minutes . the command \ \ \ { plant } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } can be so@@ aked in the area of &quot; &quot; Hu@@ ig@@ â , &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the calculation will only be c@@ auti@@ ous within the environment ( from \ \ ) { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restrictions ( number ) for the changes within a environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . will be found either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; \ \ \ { emp@@ h } : this command is suitable for the cur@@ sive pressure , until he will be closed as long as usual until he can be shown with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be cur@@ sive with \ \ emp@@ h { word } . &quot;
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ \ { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
&quot; after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language , then follows a step @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; once the wi@@ z@@ ard was entered into a bit of text , a few adjustments should be carried out for the better read@@ ability of the document . to this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in grease and cur@@ sive pressure , and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , using Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E can be turned back to the editor ( at an external viewer ) , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is a solid file format ( engl . D e V ice I ) . these files are created by &amp; tex , or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi issue such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed properly ( if the printer is correct ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar can be added to the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the conversion in familiar other formats can begin using the P@@ FE in the tool bar . &quot;
the previous post @-@ search for the direct jump from the editor to be added within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding attitude for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binding files . this must only be able to set up Modern under Settings ... tools .
&quot; in order to search for the stock search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be cli@@ cked into a line of the source . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with a click of the central mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; file and hur@@ ry ; as text editor must be specified as text editor ( setting ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor ) &quot;
&quot; if using fast @-@ installation of &amp; DVI ; viewer should not be able to advance an error . if a bug occurred , this should be displayed in the log@@ ging file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log@@ ging file is the source of error in the source code . in the editor , the log@@ ging file will always be used between the errors . the log@@ ging file indicates the error in the log@@ ging , must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging , navigating immediately to the error line . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on the appropriate button in the tool bar , a window to choose from using template for document . the pre@@ set files are : &quot;
&quot; when choosing empty document , a document may be written either by reason or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document . for more information , this section are included in the section . &quot;
&quot; professional users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates , stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or created a new file . can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file original document . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , a template using file new will be replaced by some strings through other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... Settings General . &quot;
&quot; to create your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings from which variables will be replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entry into document class . typically , it will be as follows : \ \ , class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard and the verb@@ ose of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps were completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template rather than the standard size can be selected . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created using a simple way to create a template , should be searched after one on the Internet , and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the reading of reading and her@@ ed@@ oms of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for the tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be made out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to know his needs , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can you start with reading the chapter Working with the Editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command conference , which can be called for the menu Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ click on a double @-@ click button to select the &amp; tex . that means that this way , clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p is only \ \ par . &quot;
&quot; when pulling the text with covered lin@@ ker button , the lyrics will be copied automatically into the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , you can find out parts of the source code in the Edit@@ ing window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source texts , and for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another colour . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can be added to each other . in this case , it is a own type of book@@ marks within the text . this jumping brand is emphas@@ ized , so they will automatically be used by the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; Kate ; already excellent M@@ Ã ities have been found in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code contains the following commands for text @-@ selection include : &quot;
&quot; a complete par@@ cel ( group of lines , which contain an empty line on both sides ) . this advanced meaning does not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only preventive thing in &amp; k@@ ile is that the sampling rate are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; the word is below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has a extended meaning , since this command is also de@@ lat@@ ex ; commands with a ring cut ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) in the end . &quot;
&quot; for reading a part of the document , it can be removed from the button . &amp; Kate ; offers the key@@ chain C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides with its own instructions for faster energy . under editing , the following commands are included in the text of the text : &quot;
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of processing output .
it was already clear that environments a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; play . therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under the work environment for a full of simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to be used . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command of \ \ in { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } , the end of the environment will be spec@@ ulated ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of many veil@@ ed environmental commands , soon the view of the environment can be lost quickly . this command will be close to the last setting , so that the poll@@ uted environment structure will not be destroyed . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under Be@@ ads Te@@ X group are a few important commands that are to work out of the environment .
&quot; with this command , the start of the current group acts ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the so@@ aked cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; with this command , the end of the current group is spec@@ kled ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the soft cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is faced or behind the soft cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex , group # is , will be spec@@ ulated by the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of welded groups @-@ bra@@ ckets you can get lost rapidly . this command , the last modified group , so that the swal@@ low structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple installation signs are used as well . for the purpose @-@ purpose implementation , the character is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; for example , the character is used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close connection mark for &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
this automatic entry for the double mounting mark can be set up under settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and can be trained .
it can also be used as well as specific settings ( e.@@ g . C or French ) and thus German or French instructions . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when pressing Shift ; En@@ ab@@ et@@ aste &amp; k@@ ile , it is a smart line breaks . if the current position within a list of lists ( e.g. plat@@ es@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is located , located &amp; k@@ ile ; not just a line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables , st@@ alls &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line breaks . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users can arrange the columns in tables and apply all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; try to encourage this . although this tab is not the da@@ in@@ ous tab@@ ulator , in the following line . although this tab@@ ulator is not added to the columns position of the current tab@@ ular . &quot;
&quot; even though &amp; Kate ; already a good source code , it has been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to provide special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . these modes are designed for automatic verification . all these modes are adjusted for different work@@ places under settings . &quot;
&quot; when you start a new environment , using the &quot; &quot; \ \ &quot; &quot; command &quot; &quot; command , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added the command \ \ end { environment } according to an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the bar code , the last letter of the input will be removed and above , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from a command . alternatively , you can jump to these positions , so that a simply jump to these positions by adjust@@ ing a stamp brand , and the well @-@ known parameters can be frozen . &quot;
&quot; under settings , set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . it can be used for different colors for the general language . - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as desire of the general language bre@@ aches can be used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not available for the processing of environments . however , there will always be a few letters to be entered and a large list with ambient commands will be used . on the other hand , environments are often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for processing of environments . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the ful@@ fil@@ ment mode , the menu bar is automatically frozen and the keyboard bar is automatically frozen and it appears in \ \ . after that , the environment can be continued in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and termin@@ ated by pressing the input bar . &quot;
&quot; after all this is completed , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list of lists , even a first \ \ item command is included . &quot;
&quot; under settings , setting ... k@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the result list of understanding mode for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ lines user defined lists of removable string , which can be set up immediately through case of settings . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl is used as an example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the Word complet@@ es the code button , or the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ zel C@@ tr@@ l + Alt @-@ space bar is replaced , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large above , for the automatic completion is not helpful . however , it has been found that many might be written in a document more than once . thus offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion for all of them already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; settings , which can be shot down . here , the swelling can also be specified for the placement of the completion . &quot;

&quot; the dialogue graphics stores the entries of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but also offer an excellent basis for change and new regulations of pages . if the PDF output is used , you can re@@ arranged the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script tools and then be converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to order the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all tools are group@@ ed into the menus for creating comp@@ iling , creation and creation . &quot;
&quot; for the compilation of the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the additional conversion can be used for the key , Alt ; 2 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file , and using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the command @-@ command , a viewer is usually called for comp@@ iling . if no integrated viewer should be used , every time there will be a new window . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project new project .... By this the following information is required for the project :
&quot; when using the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the application of EC@@ MAS@@ cript coding . scripts can be managed to be managed in vertical bars .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be used in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ;
the first must be said that the development environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , where the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages , offers a lot of different help to support the users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; there is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is ideal for searching for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . as it is a very large document , it is found in &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the correct document is not always easy ; / lyrics ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and here for a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the gra@@ ven advantage is the search for package names or whi@@ pped cream . then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the subject of space bar the viewer for the document .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ Source editor that can be found on all systems with installed &amp; K@@ DE ; - and Unix systems . also available on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
&quot; many thanks to those who are aiming after the continuation of the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project stri@@ ve for many hours for the development of tools , which we may use all under the attention of the &amp; GNU / License . &quot;

&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has been on pro@@ c and how much it is . take it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! just click on a terminal ; just click the icon of the XML processor and get ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expected to be a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is found in the mixed work@@ folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders , and enter the required folder in other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time when the pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already mentioned , everyone who has already worked on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has already been working , as helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now there is a great graphical interface for that . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply let the current working folder . if not , then choose current work@@ folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a output on the screen , your file is fl@@ aw@@ ful . please check the mistakes and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , then they can easily check the current file . if not , delete it in current file the skins and choose them to transfer the file through other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if they only want to know whether the file well @-@ known , they click the Well @-@ compliant review selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file selection , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) , specifications for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG test is the indication of definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; application tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file is specified in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; already marked , then let the current file simply select . if not , remove the current file and select the file extension file using the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is called , to . the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ in , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; loading , have to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even perhaps little to do . therefore , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can use the desired in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more then you will find further down below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug in or a box , we start with the menu plug @-@ in . thus the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialog enables to manage all plug@@ ins and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path leads to the search of plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people work in a sort of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of user and used for unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders as well as Sub@@ project Manager . &quot;
&quot; the user can search for themselves out of the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who he is . this is done by asking the team member of the list and press the sealed button . the current selected member ( their identification ) appears in bold after you are : text . &quot;
&quot; nickname , and the attitude of your own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the overview of her team , there is another advantage of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information on the team manager when something is done . see in further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed if something specific in the project happens . an example would be to draw the opening of opening and closing of the project so that later , how much someone has to be saved , or the sending of a message when a file is saved , or a script that will be added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see list selected address data . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see in that we@@ i such ladder can be set up .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
note : it may be selected either to select notes from the editor @-@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a commentary area followed by text @-@ text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Ber@@ eich@@ mann Manager Sub@@ project Manager should be given the corresponding name or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roles names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scri@@ pt@@ - and form@@ att@@ ing languages that is DT@@ D ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scri@@ p@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; the settings are reachable via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be accessed by settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers some pages , which are treated to each other . &quot;
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car complet@@ es can be changed . entries are :
large / Klein@@ sch@@ ography of tags : large / small description of automatic tags : large / small p@@ added means that tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
large / Klein@@ sch@@ ography of attributes : large / small p@@ added of automatically added attributes . normal Groß / Klein@@ sch@@ enberg means that attributes are inserted into the same as they are described in the day XML files .
&quot; optional tags : if requested , is available for tags for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
not optional tags : as top for all other tags with the exception of easy tags .
&quot; starting and closing day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of accent : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the appropriate coding during installation .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ ype to detect various types of files . the default settings can be restored .
standard drawing : the encoding of newly created or in other way as with file open @-@ open files ( where the encoding of the file can be approached ) but this setting is used by the same in the project characteristics when a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . this attitude will be used by the same in the project characteristics when a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that with a blackout or crash when next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even for even stored documents , a backup will be created regularly , according to the created time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or own view ( or documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and the source code simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; set the window settings to the standard back to the next start , when the user interface due to change the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ uous command line parameters . &quot;
the warning messages is based on the tax of the possibility to release warning of war@@ nings by in@@ ha@@ ken by no longer .
&quot; the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code in shared mode . regarding the different modes , see . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the image of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be stopped in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change by clicking the structural setup with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the range of structural tree settings , the visibility can be opened automatically in the tree , which are automatically opened in a change of structural tree , and how deep groups are found in the text , while empty groups are not found in the current document , no element is found . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ation , abbrevi@@ ations of abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded in any text . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; in which the i@@ f@@ clause makes something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins can be managed by the third side , which can be re@@ used by each other part @-@ part application , the best known &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; with inser@@ tion of plug@@ ins must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to plug@@ in if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is handed over to the Plug@@ in , so it can open the current file to the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; download component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check whether the plug @-@ in store is ref@@ using . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to store when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; plug@@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the registered information is correct . if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but if plug@@ in at the moment is not available , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been dis@@ continued , as well as support for the d@@ b@@ g deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of it , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept has been implemented , which enabled various implem@@ ent@@ ations of plug@@ ins . &quot;
currently only one plug@@ in is available ; support for use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
&quot; the use of the deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project begins with the selection of a suitable deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in selection field , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of supervised variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
&quot; a view , in which all holding points , listed with line numbers and conditions are usually listed in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) is shown in the lower Do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger is required if required , or it divi@@ des plug@@ in to listen to debit needs . this action is executed by default , if a project is opened , so that a deb@@ ug@@ ger does not have to be considered . &quot;
the equivalent to deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the post @-@ demands .
sends a HTTP request to the server to process a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
&quot; the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and the current line is continuously to send . if this happens when the script is started , the execution will continue . if this is done , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script without any information transmitted variables and the current line number . if this is done , the execution run . if this is done , the execution starts when a deb@@ ug@@ gets is given , the execution begins once a request is executed . &quot;
&quot; the deb@@ ug@@ ger takes the next instruction in the script , without going into the functions or includes : &quot;
&quot; the deb@@ ug@@ ger takes the next instruction in the script , whereby when possible in functions and includes a mistake . &quot;
&quot; indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to transfer the instruction and go to the next , as if there were not the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialogue in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the supervised value appears in the variation . &quot;
&quot; with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;

&quot; document type E@@ edit packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for marking and scripts . their simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; DT@@ EP ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language and CSS . &amp; DT@@ EP ; s consist of two parts , the tag file and tool@@ bars ; and day folders contain two file types , the text and instructions qu@@ icker into one document as one user might have . &quot;
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details for transformation . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; DT@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dialog@@ es , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; self . tool@@ bars enable quick setup of tags in a document without any risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; day folders are nothing as a folder . you only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folders bear the name of descri@@ b@@ able language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better viewing and more information at work with them . &quot;
&quot; the following chapter describes every element in detail , everything about the possibilities and borders will be revealed in a simple way . &quot;
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain once in one document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type over itself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for the meeting class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for the type Method . gives the name of the class to where this method is heard . ( family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has added a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
there is a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this item can only be specified for any attribute . it contains the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that describe how this attribute will be displayed and etc ; This is a only element @-@ type element . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the source used for the attributes used in the tag Edit@@ or@@ dialog and the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ological name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is used for achieving the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting edge and a method@@ ology . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . can be empty or % daily name , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only happen for a attribute description . it is an element @-@ type element .
determines the location of a tags within a dialog . this day can only happen to any attribute in a dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
&quot; there is a list of elements , which may occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type . &quot;
there is a list of elements that end one day . this element is a only element type .
all day XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything but watch out &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML file , the tools dialog up in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and checked Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , checking only during charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; in the following example , for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; -@@ ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this day XML file is to be schem@@ atic tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following example , for a working family 2 day XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot;
&quot; the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor to be easily accessible via DT@@ D . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it should be created for a new &amp; DT@@ EP ; it should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; version = U@@ GH 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
a action can be set with settings actions ... will be created . Click on New Action to the same dialog :
&quot; this action is assigned to the key abbrevi@@ ation . with clicking the button user , a keyboards can be assigned ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ cut . &quot;
the easiest promotions . it can be entered into the determin@@ ated settings and inserted in the action this text is inserted into the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to use the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , which are the quick start @-@ dialog or the various read in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ dir variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
&quot; % f : let &apos;s replace the document &apos;s URL . in case of a local document , file names : / from the document name is removed . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; process replaces . if by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used for controlling &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameter for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the listed methods mentioned , a script input of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus can be submitted to the default setting . in the sel@@ ector input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default entry . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the applied application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal edition , written on the default issue ; error messages to the default output is required by the value added to the selection field : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . in the case it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts working mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and if the day attributes , and you plan to plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Day , &quot; if available , to use an input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly icon . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; menu ; , graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select size to others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a button icon as a symbol . using the use of green ( green will usually be interpreted as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least add a message to the user ; start@@ up ; -@@ Day in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done by the menu with att@@ itudes ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the required action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; choose the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button and continue with other tags , if there are , or confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for the tool bar , or it should be divided to a better overview by some Tren@@ ner in several groups . open the tool will be selected to adjust the desired tool bar . &quot;
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( on top left ) for my tool bar . after selection of the element , added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool bar must be tested by adding all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; secure in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in proper folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be saved in proper folder ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for scri@@ p@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing language , which you like to like . therefore , this chapter , how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you may check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first you need to create a exist@@ ent documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc . language . then , you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first part , we will be able to treat the second part here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = arrow path , relatively to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = -@@ 1.@@ html @-@ 1 = -@@ 1,@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ s.@@ l. = tag@@ s.@@ l. = tag@@ s.@@ l. &quot;
&quot; the tree tree defines the visible part of documentation in documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like something : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 on PHP 4.2 Tracks = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Basic syntax , ... Basic Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic Edition = Ro@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html &quot;
&quot; notice the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that there are sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess tel@@ ex@@ ts ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it out . &quot;
note that the table of contents can be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently the upper end of the supervision &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything but watch out &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resource @-@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the range of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed on the design of context of context . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines . &quot;
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just back to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R /
&quot; if you are sure that this well and it is worth , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used on the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to be with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the present resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources may be sent via email to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can be downloaded and only available if our team needs them correctly and used for the release , for what a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key is required , for what our team is ensured for our team as well as for the future users . &quot;
&quot; after loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys you can stay out . in the dialog New resource , the input fields can be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and click OK to upload the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; upload the menu DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) to upload tool@@ bars , and upload tool@@ bar , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , studied &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the integrity and the Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in the case of problems , it may be cancelled . if the integrity is given and the resource correct is correct , a message appears with the message of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work with XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; but it can be hard to work by using a DT@@ EP package because hundreds of day files can be converted into a DT@@ EP package automatically . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and convert a DT@@ D menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with DT@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ ing line : the string that appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
&quot; DT@@ EP after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with details of the newly introduced &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter attempts to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; little use to bro@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; util@@ ises , available . from tool@@ bars on actions , everything is selected as global , in common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved . this enables the group of administ@@ rators different mold , actions , and patterns of the global tree to ensure that each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system are available . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so they can only use these users personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be done with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s folder , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the construction of construction , the cart@@ ons with info and the tool . please suggest in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the ant@@ ei@@ vers with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as close to the current , other or all flash@@ cards , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to an book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; rectangle in the Edit@@ or@@ section lead to another context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , edit the text under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file when the string is under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor , the editors of the editor is currently taking &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool will be adapted to the new functions and thus related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; then click on the symbol that the tag is represented . now they can insert the data for this just one day , then you can insert several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , then you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate in the information on &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate to open and cross @-@ strip . in representation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , which provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project via right mouse click . actions like Add , Rem@@ ov@@ ing , upload , or delete files from the storage media . &quot;
&quot; another way of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a presentation : pictures , program parts , a whole site &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates are divided into three categories , depending on what connection is used . the category depends on &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; working range . global templates are always available , local templates are only available in the project . more to templates are available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available script languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can click on the right button . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through right @-@ click the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the element of element . by right @-@ click of an element it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears under the other construction of buildings . with it you can change the attributes and names of names . this tree allows the content of all available attributes with few cli@@ cks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation for Web @-@ technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cartridges at the lower end of the window , via the usable information can be achieved : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
this box shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite shows all errors in the current document on the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed are giving all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . showing them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate page of the tool is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define . &quot;
&quot; a further function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ sar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you get a tool bar in an email , you can backup them in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and download ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adapt the location of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems at the start of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of it &apos;s folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines an sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developer of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a close idea . now , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well @-@ made available on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML , then it should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above @-@ mentioned claim must be stated that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; development community is not only all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; automation &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . by the program comp@@ ose , you can mem@@ ori@@ ze it &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can find out without any scri@@ pt@@ able script tax . ( more on it can be found in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in any way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in details of this documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta run ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta is currently developed and served by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as MAN@@ T@@ IA am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not located on , whereby the oldest record is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section above templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project predecessor , only a mistake has been reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ tion from the clip@@ board , special characters from the clip@@ board contained in the clip@@ board included , so that it is correct , and not be understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; en@@ roll@@ ment , which is the correct way to insert a special characters and space character in &amp; URL ; s . first line to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
the block selection switches or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of &amp; Shift ; check out .
&quot; go directly to a line number , which is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages is released ! &quot;

&quot; displays the symbol sp@@ ends left from the main window . this column allows you to put , book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries prior or next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document . &quot;
&quot; book@@ marks from other opened documents , group@@ ed by the file name to the other documents . &quot;

presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; search the project directory to new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphical files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have any further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects can be found in detail . &quot;
invites a project tool bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . this creates just the name . actions must be saved through settings , or you will be asked if you want to store the tool . &quot;
&quot; a tool@@ bar from the visible range is removed . if you don &apos;t delete the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; thus , you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team so that the tool bar is available in the next publication ) . the menu entry opens a new E@@ mail message with the tool bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the upload of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see . &quot;
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own image format .
&quot; upload / clo@@ ds of de@@ ities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the de@@ ities are not present from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; to renew the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this global , and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which includes the list of tags / actions on this tool bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific under@@ men@@ ü@@ s . &quot;
activ@@ ates and disabled the smart insert of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . smar@@ ter In@@ sert means that &amp; quant@@ aph@@ lus is rejected if this day does not resist the rules this site .
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins listed below are listed below the above menu . Click the click of a activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated . &quot;
select the default settings for the current file . the list of available her@@ b@@ ating schem@@ ata depends on the list .
&quot; select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by external use .
&quot; immediate switching between the various types of the user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching circuit may need times or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the box mode , which is also the default setting , or the lower window mode , which is the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu has an entry for each open window . with selecting a contract , the appropriate sub@@ window is activated . &quot;
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the main window .
&quot; changes in this dialog affects any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web brows@@ ers . &quot;
does the behavior of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialogue appears in which you can delete entries from the tool , which can add and follow the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should produce an aid according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but like with any open source project , developers can always use help . when they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form can be found here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project below , as for example , after filling the project named the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when typ@@ ing name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces using the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine to which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
&quot; if you use this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol can be used . depending on the remote control unit , an adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the file where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the tool will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from local fil@@ esystem to the project . several files or folders can be selected .
&quot; this attitude is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change . at ser@@ ver@@ page scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) one has to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , which are located somewhere in the main file of the project , should be integrated . if a project is started ane@@ w , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main compartment , and you can be able to make a precise choice . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main file . you can select the desired files by pressing , or , by removing the skins , cl@@ amps from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project wi@@ z@@ ard includes three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also instantly upload files in the menu project Properties in the lower window profiles , or with the keyboards Shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings are described in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; complem@@ entary option to above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . at the moment only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed is available . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set with the options options . in this case the trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described .
&quot; in the bottom window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , pointing an own construction supervision for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the lower window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration you can switch the event actions , add or delete these actions , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed if a specific event occurs , such as the viewing of a file . see in details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project which was opened . this behavior is not possible to influence . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select the project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files are done . the same if you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives access to the files in the project . there you can manage files in the current project .
&quot; folder also behave as well , however , the entries must be opening and open ... in combination with the right mouse button , click menu : &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information on the location of uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing the removal . &quot;
password will keep in the core memory and at program end . this possibility is useful when frequent high load files is necessary and the rather uns@@ afe password on the plate option does not come in question .
&quot; this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog , if you change your opinion before up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high load profiles can be uploaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server that the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( locally ) and NFS .
&quot; port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except for the network administrator , service does not operate on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your att@@ acking wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it to your discretion . the password will be stored on the plate so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programm@@ ability can see it easily in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple di@@ pping of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu , or the project tool@@ bar , easily accessible via Settings tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to own working mode . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best via the menu tool@@ bars . use and add differ . the adding of tool@@ bars will be treated below the section adding machine tools .
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be adjusted either via the context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which the new tool bar can easily remove , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where actions on this or other tool should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , additionally the entries will remove and action are displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up menu with settings of tool@@ bars ... and setting actions .. set .
&quot; templates are in key documentation , code escal@@ opes and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any on the system existing directory with extended organisation and interfaces . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you need to set up for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually added in documents using IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l . some examples are available in the storage space below global templates . further information to templates are available . &quot;
documents can be created by any text document type . based on this templates you can be created new documents . normally a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es work in any way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage space below global templates . see in for more information on templates .
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a presentation but the same text area is always inserted into the documents . you can find everything , from a comment on a final menu , on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl base . some examples are located in the storage space below global templates . see in for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are intended for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents arranged in a file structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archives . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure for popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File as template as local Tem@@ plate .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the repository . look at the repository under project places . &quot;
&quot; in your document , select text in your document and save the selection as local / reposit@@ ories . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and lay on the construction views templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is just copy into a pre @-@ plant folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pulling and insert or insert via the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select in the file tree or in the project files building file to a folder right and secure site template , select a name for the template and secure . by default , the project folder is secured , but of course it can be saved as local or global presentation . &quot;
project management enable a very target @-@ oriented ancest@@ or . you can link head@@ lines and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design to insert files or link with them . additionally you can retain some things when using templates in projects very deep in eye .
the structure structure in the sub@@ window templates are based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / templates . each of this folder is equivalent to one of four types of containers such as above .
&quot; to determine the behaviour of a folder , in order to click on the right button of the mouse button on the folder and select the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low as soon as el@@ ter@@ able attributes contra@@ cted . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except for regular folders . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able in this path , except it would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , it is probably found in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; permitted or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project , allowing for all templates for a specific project , allowing a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ er . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you have to press the context menu ( click on the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert from templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode replaces the source Editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second will divide the editor window in two parts : the source Editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it invites you to edit a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; - page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and if required for source code editor that are visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates that it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; the second mode is exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are activated in the source Editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is already active , this mode is already active , the key pressure of the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is retained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between V@@ PL ; Editor and the source Editor can be set adjustable via synchron@@ ization following a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation can be set automatically . generally , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast calcul@@ ator and a large pot for slow computer . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools need to choose from invisible tags in the work with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; this allows to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information on the document itself , i.e. , key words for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows for example key words on the column names and keywords : keyword keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to designing pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change on the list is precisely as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is not yet supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style , by pressing the button button and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the cur@@ sors use is like in a word processing , possible through moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is distinctive as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing , and can be deleted by typ@@ ing or distance . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion tags will be made in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source Editor . it is necessary to consider that the inser@@ tion tags can not be removed beforehand , e.g. an anchor @-@ day , surrounded by text , must be removed by any other environments . &quot;
some tool work such as the tables @-@ assistant or the lists of the lists are disabled . you will work on &amp; V@@ PL ; will work in this release must be used on the tables or lists of tool .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining style of style . in contrast to other programs for Stil@@ ts the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be prosec@@ uted .

starts a shell . then enter the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of help .
adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; also added to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation on the &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot; command .
&quot; the conversion takes 20 times , if --@@ that is two times , the conversion will run 100 times &quot;
&quot; the input documents are treated as HTML files , if the support has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document , if the support is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is enabled as default . &quot;
&quot; on systems with installed read@@ line library , you can switch with the arrow keys to / from the beginning of the previous commands . &quot;
several commands require more than an argument . quotes : using the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a brake point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only from ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name as &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s user . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on RIS@@ C @-@ OS systems are also permitted further environment variables .
path : a path to changing the workplace . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; replaces the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphic tools to the same . so why &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain shortly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and at the same time had corrected a lot of modifications at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts with mer@@ ging .
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where maybe only the entry was changed . the merge of these changes was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; thus , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and modifications to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; if you like to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two persons are working independently to a piece of co@@ de and make changes simultaneously . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files to merge : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ ing and merge file . this image photograph shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; diff@@ 3 ; shows the accurate differences , and enable the possibilities of current color monitors . if you frequently need to check it , you will like this function . &quot;
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see that at a glance at the Sum@@ mary in the column on the left side . ( no anger anymore if no one change the back . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy the ti@@ p@@ ments by using only the file name to the file &apos;s first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder folder , diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder , folder 3 folder &quot;
&quot; the opening dialog allows manual input of fil@@ en@@ ames , select the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last open file from the list file . if you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you do not have the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; on the button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or mer@@ ging of folders will be selected , for B and C however a file , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when merge is crossed , the input field is active and can be edit . however , it is not necessary to determine immediately a output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare all file , but only parts of a text format . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board in the active compar@@ ative window . the comparison starts , you can easily connect the dialog with the button button . &quot;
you can also use pulling and insert : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text out of an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what idea is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file for example several similar functions . if you would like to figure out what these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would need to copy first two corresponding files , add in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare it . now you can simply copy the relevant sections . &quot;
note : you are currently unable to pull out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the falling text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and dis@@ assem@@ bling text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a while , let the mouse button for a while . then a small relief window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources are assigned to letters A , B and C . it has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed on the Settings menu ) . &quot;
&quot; if a difference is recognized , one can see on the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( M@@ erging ) . &quot;
&quot; right next to the text is the summary column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; vertical line , which separates the summary column from text , is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks is activated , the line is shown on the broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison list ) also has an Info @-@ line with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have the result . usually , it contains data , but often contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jumps to next dissolved / ung@@ el@@ dest conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons can be used , each difference is also a conflict of manually must be solved . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the left hand column in one of the window , the group &apos;s first line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . this group is then highlighted by the color background colour for current area , and each on the left appears a black beam . &quot;
&quot; sometimes we have no further line left in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of the text &amp; lt ; no one line for the fall , you may change your mind and perhaps again another source . this text will not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark that you might want to copy and somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; cable runs ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; this will navigate mainly with the image level and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can also use the arrow keys to the right , right , bottom , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also click on the vertical image bar . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ abe@@ e window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the insert button you can switch between insert and trans@@ verse mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section ) and the ed@@ itable output window was explained ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar includes seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( Str@@ g @-@ below / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture above / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture above / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , must be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; in order to copy the marking in the clip@@ board , you &apos;ll need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if this option is activated , you will select automatically into the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful , because you could accid@@ entally over@@ write the content of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line @-@ to @-@ end systems are stored in accordance with the default operating system . UNIX @-@ based systems use \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the line of the source files not , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files are stored automatically and re@@ produced by the next start . ( menu adjustment - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a let@@ tering with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also provides a variable width to choose from , but you should not use this . ) &quot;
&quot; if you dis@@ able this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ic writing . if the chosen script is not supported , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; systems with only 16 or 256 colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed . on these systems the button settings automatically introduces an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , when pressing the tab@@ ulator button inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , an tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you enter or press the return , the back line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , any selection will be copied automatically into the clip@@ board . the manual copy into the clip@@ board then falls . &quot;
you can choose which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally common selection on the used operating system .
&quot; the same step is trying to find &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines will be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white characters may be ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . even when combined , white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again save one line @-@ to @-@ page &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if this option is activated , however , if this option is activated , however , if this option is activated , this option must be disabled . if this option is activated , this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
inten@@ sely looking for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slow to very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atically @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next Hungarian conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ solves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files , then use the option W@@ ähle A / B / C for all un@@ conscious white conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are treated in Chapter for scanning of folders and conduct a merge . look for details below documentation to directory @-@ compare and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already a older version exists , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original . if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; fits the language of the user interface . this option does not relate to the current program . you must finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; finish and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available because the language there is global over the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; a short notice about the selection fields for the coding , a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has an inform@@ al character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences such as special characters treated and interpreted as special characters . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can determine which coding should be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only cope with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
turn this off to supp@@ ress her@@ b@@ ating changes in white characters in the text or opinions . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colour coded transition column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ C ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C will be displayed next to the normal one @-@ second column @-@ column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply send the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; submit the comparison window side by side , or ski@@ pped each other . this option can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to assemble the files together . then , if you use only two files . a simple click starts the merge file and uses the file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass the command to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example , to cut out parts or correct to correct use . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was given ( see above ) , then the edition of command is specified only by the command processor . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow more flexibility when setting the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users want to program it out . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l perfectly suff@@ used . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input in large letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words automatically generated by automatically generated character chains ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . so the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while using experim@@ enting , you may start to understand it and perhaps you might like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ normal@@ . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi er@@ ased . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , you may have to perform several narr@@ ations at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements . example : &quot;
&quot; instead of used , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings in per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the prec@@ urs@@ ed &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merge . further operations only change data that sees the line @-@ off al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences are hidden , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
often programm@@ ers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete file recur@@ sively and composite .
... make a proposal to merge the proposal ; you can adapt the proposal before starting
&quot; can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes , without making it truly , &quot;
... &quot; you will perform selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of individual files . you have to specify only folder on command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders will be merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder has been given , uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , not the merge . to select the merge , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during reading the folder , you inform@@ s a small news window over the current progress . if you break the scanning of the file , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the file is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and each folder of the scan is found here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
&quot; the folder structure is normally folded together . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the link or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions : all sub@@ directories on the left / right . the directory menu includes all the sub@@ directories with which you can open all the folder . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge is started again , you will be informed about problems of this species . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; identical entries , however , the color is identical even if the age of entries are different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered identical , when their whole content is identical . then , folder is the same color . in folder the age is less for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , is red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C cannot have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such error objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such error objects exist can &apos;t be started .
mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder have been specified . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that the two folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; directly after the merge is copied &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) , then the date of files and suggests the newer file size : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such mistakes can &apos;t be removed , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , one file is working after the other . status column displays Fer@@ tig , if the merge is successful , and according to other messages , if the merge is completed , you should check out whether the status is ok everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three files are compared or together . ) &quot;
&quot; you can assemble either the selected entry ( file or o@@ deb@@ tors ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ connected actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have any target folder , then in the Three @-@ file merge mode C is used as the target and sync A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the folder structure , even in the folder structure , there are some options to avoid in@@ loving surprises : &quot;
&quot; to assemble all entries , select directories hold together / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key root ) . to only get the current entry : select the promotion of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if due to contradic@@ tory data types , there are still invali@@ d merge actions , a message appears on the faul@@ t@@ ful elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you assemble all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options yield , sim@@ ulate and break . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen , without which really changes will be made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together of a single file ) , then a merge window ( please note the screenshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are ready to start with a file , select directories hold together / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , an appropriate dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , there will be a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll notice some errors that will help you to select or the problem@@ atic entry . so you have the option to select another action to select or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been carried out individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them not again . even if the merge is not done , these entries will be done as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will again be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
&quot; only files that fit onto the specified pattern , are displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered several patterns . plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folders must not conform to this pattern . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern , are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered in the elementary tree . it can be more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern , are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered in the elementary tree . it can be more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
ignored files which are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mat@@ ically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this file is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a file attribute . in other file systems marked a pre@@ defined point . a file is hidden or not . this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; with links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links are displayed . this is de@@ activated by default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on : if the option is switched off , the links like normal folder will be checked and recur@@ sive . ( note that &amp; diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions . a link to a file of link should lead to a final loop and crash@@ es up . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics of statistics . ( the number of sol@@ der , un@@ u@@ ine , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare big file via a slow network , it may be faster , only the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain extent of safety . please note with caution . this option is ab@@ orted in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to confidenti@@ ality date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical , if they are equal to size . that may be useful for example , when copying the amendment date . please turn off with caution . this option is ab@@ orted in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode if two file is compared and no target file is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merge files are identical . also the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merge the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered to be sure that the other file is not changed ) . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in any case . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a file is replaced or deleted , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file is already deleted , this will also be deleted without further backup . this option is enabled in default . this option is switched on . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder inter@@ ce@@ ability view could be visible to the merge files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to set the window directory and text windows , turn the main window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to get a file simply by double @-@ click . however , there is also a menu entry in the directory menu . as soon as you save the file , the status is set to set out and the file will not be done again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost only if you want to read the directory : directory menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers . &quot;
&quot; the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on the FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive , with a local file . &quot;
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively , or .. . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
or it cannot be distingu@@ ish@@ able if a link shows a file or folder . then it will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : p . FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit the per@@ missions or change date . therefore the per@@ missions or change date is from the original . ( note that the option of confidence of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
&quot; the main purpose is currently known as the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first to launch the built @-@ in differences , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ part display from the context menu . &quot;
normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 needs ; two complete input files ; however it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it takes &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the Patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch is to restore the missing file .
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a Patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ part . please note that this does not work when it does not work the original files . in addition , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . mer@@ ging or the same of folders is not supported in the box mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ els ) is already available . additionally the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve used GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot since I looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers who have gone out this way or get him so .
&quot; you will probably compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE will not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find detailed information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated as non @-@ white lines , next to Each other , this is , this is , this is just the case the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor indicates each difference in the files where it begins and where he ends . this important information is necessary , however , if the result is easily stored as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design an extra own file format that could store this information . &quot;
&quot; the effort for this was so far too large . you can recover a specific version , always by selecting a source A / B / C . for larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing text , suddenly no sr@@ c lin@@ s ; appeared and the text can &apos;t delete it . what does this mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; already used many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
&quot; information , as you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage . &quot;
you can find a list of the last changes below htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; diff@@ 3 , on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic file of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ you can install the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . however , difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or switch @-@ off ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or change @-@ insert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker .
only differences are shown : files are not identical in the folder structure and therefore not in the target folder .
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to upgrade to these options the folder with the function Update . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are indicated , the differences are displayed . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing following the merge . ( behavior is probably amended in later program version ) this option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with the labels A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are already present ) , they will click on the button to the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ statement in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , shows a miniature show of all virtual desktop areas . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on working areas to complete their size , to end or move it . this works both within a working area as well as in several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , can display all virtual desktop areas as well as in the current applications . applications can be selected and even in the working area and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the medium mouse button , windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved . the movement is possible both within a workplace as well as to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , this context menu will also address the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , working area and end . commands are the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the working area . only if applied to an application .
&quot; send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only , when it has been cli@@ cked on a application . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual desktop areas are displayed . &quot;
&quot; crossing the field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual desktop areas . it is crossed together with name , the names are provided with North @-@ numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working area . &quot;
&quot; if this box is crossed , the background of each working area is also displayed as a background at the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this box is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to make their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the program window . symbol indicates the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here you can appear the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window will appear : classic &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , as well known as P@@ ager @-@ applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual working areas in a horizont@@ ally @-@ proof and vertically in a vertical range , which is very good for displaying sides on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
clicking the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent access to switch switch ... lets the dialog appear .
&quot; at the moment , this can not be changed in the dialog settings , but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t need to register as a user , or use your system administrator to your system administrator . in this file , you must specify the key win@@ dow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ mode and as@@ sign a value to this file . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , part of the package base , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE @-@ Basic package . &quot;

&quot; if you can use &amp; k@@ mag , you can use &amp; k@@ may ; a part of the screen can be found , as if you would like to read a sample for the small printed or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is intended to include a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly expanding to new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag . below , this window shows the enlarged area of the screen . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
in the default setting up &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like an event@@ ual magni@@ fying glass . alternatively you can set up a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection process mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter on the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can shift it with arrows and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following manner : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can einf@@ alls the contents of the magni@@ fying glass . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the box window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the sel@@ f@@ stand firm remains firm and only move the lower right corner . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag . features a lot of functions . you can save the enlarged picture directly to the printer , into a file , turn into the clip@@ board ( to insert later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more . &quot;
&quot; starts , or stops the updating of the ad . the stop@@ over of the update causes the required CPU time to 0 . &quot;
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very High ) . the higher the updating rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in one window . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , once the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same place . it is intended to help people who are suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain @-@ in@@ jury syndrome ) and that every mouse click . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , once the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same place . it &apos;s intended to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive strain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and that every mouse click may em@@ ulate pain . however , this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain when using the mouse button , so many people can cause pain without pain . unfortunately , you can also seek pain that are related to the use of your computer . unfortunately , you should consult a doctor unless the use of your computer . &quot;
&quot; to set it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid using the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by using the mouse , it is us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can fall differently . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; the smart shifting is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . you now move the mouse in pressing the mouse button . this way you may require a bit exercise , but you &apos;ll get used fast . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the mouse movement , it must be min@@ ed before &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click brings out . &quot;
&quot; Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the speed field shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button is waiting , before it takes the mouse button once again , if there is no need of mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now activ@@ ates the click on the right and back , followed by a break , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow start to the left and return one click . these movements will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE ; to make the response time . open it to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the Sound System and here the rider General . there &apos;s a sliding sound buffer , which you can set up to a lower value to reduce the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is marked &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this feature is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please take the documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set the settings back on the values , which have been adjusted for opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button on the press after the last pressures of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first , especially the smart shifting , you should start off at first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click here , you can later take the smart shifting . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times from &amp; K@@ DE ; to decrease sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of what places are a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on sites in the browser window that don &apos;t have any link , does not park to un@@ wanted reactions . therefore , you can park the mouse to such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ le , you should clean your mouse . it is normally pretty simple . the trick is normally clean . the trick is not only the mouse , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to take out the mouse ball . as it happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you view the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and so@@ iling can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the version of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just started a shift in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can &apos;t end more by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you themselves run a mouse click . herein is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; set back and you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : when you enter text , try &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor into place where you want to have it . but if you do not have the mouse on a neutral area of working area , if you don &apos;t want to make sure that the mouse poin@@ ter is un@@ intenti@@ onal . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey surfaces to make the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent one , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart shifting is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very probably possible to copy it into the clip@@ board , and to re @-@ add or any other action , where you will probably prepare the mouse when pressing the mouse button . here are some advice about this : &quot;
&quot; use the intelligent use not if you &apos;re just starting to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead as follows : take a mouse click on the other end of the text area and hold the mouse button to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . therefore , every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the smart shifting off without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window , must be installed . this should be the case on most system . &quot;
&quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available , when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker . &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; p@@ orted the mouse button once the mouse poin@@ ter briefly dist@@ orted . this program has been designed for people who are suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome and to whom the des@@ irable pain prepar@@ es .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for that a drawing process begins to get rid of the mouse button . in this way , the pulling and shooting with the mouse is carried out . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the dum@@ b users can speak to their computers for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; m@@ ute users can choose the computer for themselves . users can choose from a list with the talk @-@ course pro@@ positions , which should be talked again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command , which later is used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard textbook book . you can often choose text passages , without having to ti@@ lt . the text passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ ity . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can read the word lists using a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ orted words can be accepted in the Wor@@ lds . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly confident and basically contains an input field for the key@@ note of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen photo ) and one circulation of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen photo ) .
&quot; if you like k@@ mouth , you can enter the pro@@ positions you want to listen to the pro@@ positions you want . every spoken proposition will be attached to the memory . you can select the pro@@ positions which are once again spoken . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ restrial and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card speech , enter the command to call the language player . in the sel@@ ector , place the character encoding , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text , select the check box if the text remains unchanged as standard input on the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is distributed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command will depend on your language generator . this command you will find in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this will be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; as a first attempt to use as Language Service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language . if that is successful , the further settings are being developed on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language is a standardized interface for speech output . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action following the selection of a text passage , you specify which action is triggered by the key@@ note or by selecting a text passage in the menu text password , or in the vest for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Instant , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally added to the disk space . with the selection of in the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field , you can define whether the textbook book will be stored automatically at the closing of the processing window . &quot;
&quot; the book is saved with the selection of text passages , the book is stored . if you select changes , the text pass@@ agen@@ ers will not be stored , select &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ agen@@ ers should be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page Wor@@ ter@@ restrial contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ lds . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a sel@@ ector , when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can currently use the current dictionary for the current account . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add the order of books , or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation one . the frequency of individual words are simply determined by departure of the list . additionally , you can compare the word list using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to just insert the written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these weights are to be collected . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you will create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly created words automatically adds to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ ag@@ les is two split . in the upper part the text pass@@ ag@@ ons are represented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard player , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books , you can either reach the option in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages can you change by pulling with the mouse to the new spot , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the pancre@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the memory card is selected . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the pancre@@ as . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a shifting tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is mounted by default on the menu bar . by mouse click on the left hand side and drawing , the tool bar can be moved to another spot . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow base in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , the box is arranged by default for text messages directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the left hand side and drawing , the tool bar can be moved to another spot . &quot;
probably you have the command for the speech output not properly or not complete . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General Settings and give the command for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to further details . )
&quot; Festival is a lingu@@ istic edition system of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch . license permits to use the festival for free and dis@@ semin@@ ate restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that Festival / us@@ r / local / local / festival is installed . the command to speech is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and dis@@ semin@@ ating any restrictions .
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for the setup of the language edition , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the file / us@@ r / local / fre@@ eing . the speech is then possible with one of the three command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the data must be added as default entry . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it turns a list of phon@@ em@@ akers in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei . therefore you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ eme . it allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ eme to phon@@ eme to MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA will be installed in / us@@ r / local / K@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax will be happy to get the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples : &quot;
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ ep@@ la / de@@ 1 / / mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; wav / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the data option has to be switched on as default .
the speech @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further speech service which provides a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently available in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different speech output systems .
&quot; since the language is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language , which appears in the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully to use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the voice generator ) , but it depends on each computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak with people who can &apos;t speak any text by the host . it will already be saved in a list of pro@@ positions which users can re@@ comp@@ ile again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - The speech output system by &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a consisting of modules of existing service which allows any application to read text on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a particle system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for speech output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programmer can also be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . also users offers interesting opportunities .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications is embedded .
&quot; the speech output is performed via the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as the peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables the creation of language spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) on the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ aux@@ iliary program .
&quot; in the future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the language edition of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without the visible window , the T@@ TS @-@ Services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ t@@ d over kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts of it .

&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to install program , tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set up properly . see also &quot;
&quot; during the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker , the card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most of the T@@ TS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer various languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such as distinguish themselves in volume or speed . you should also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least one speaker before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise used . &quot;
various speaker for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printing couples for the same printer .
&quot; when you click on the Cart@@ a Cart@@ a speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed automatically , if you start a kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no narr@@ ator is set up . &quot;
&quot; all actors already appear in this list . the preferred actors appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for speech output , if an application has no narr@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the actors from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the actors in the list a line further down below . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; here is a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ gen@@ ces and girls . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to card ticket and check if language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed off . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text orders to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language selection system from &amp; K@@ DE . Click on the Cart@@ ei@@ kart@@ en@@ re@@ ek General to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts off the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS @-@ service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can make text orders and read before . see . remove the marker , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System by &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue to activate the field edition ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically at the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears as soon as the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start text orders , pause , stop and return . &quot;
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; clip@@ board or read a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
&quot; Click users or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the Cart@@ ei@@ kart@@ en@@ re@@ ek General and cross the speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can check out the text of the shown website . check the text that should be read and select in the main menu tools Text . after a short time , the language edition should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web site . you can ski@@ p this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ loop lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the displayed text , check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs out . then mark the text that should be read and select in the Main Menu Tools text . then the speech output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works , if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Not@@ with@@ is the news system of &amp; K@@ DE , which you will notify you of fixed events . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up different types of messages , for example , that you may notify me if you appear in a IR@@ C channel , in which your Nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news message . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ emer@@ ald , appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program . here , the possible settings for each notation differ according to application . &quot;
&quot; it is a good example to correct or correct messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b out of the messages , the mail sent , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be accepted as provided in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not necessary .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to improve the language or short@@ cuts , select a suitable language and speaker to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the operation of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the screen of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other orders , and keeps these orders . if the release of the screen reader is read , orders received again continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of news and normal text . this orders will continue after the issue of warning .
we have the next transaction priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site can be found . &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications are also news . read it .
the rest are simple text orders . any order you use from the card ordering orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ ite is an example of applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output longer texts that have no particular manipulation .
&quot; all four order types are working in qu@@ eue , with the exception of the release of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads , will hold this issue and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the Edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern . you will be applied on normal war@@ nings , news and text orders , as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and give it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are done as modules . in the future it can still give further types of filters .
&quot; character replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . that can be done either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre @-@ defined strings as well as : - ) by text , or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; into a better comprehen@@ sible shape . &quot;
&amp; XML ; transform@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; a few X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are contained in SS@@ ML .
&quot; alternatively , you can send orders depend on the content of the text or depending on the program that send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have hired a female voice on the card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter does not apply , he will not apply the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent by all activated filters , it will be arranged through all activated filters , which takes place in the order in the list below . &quot;
this shows the list of common normal filters . if a filter is not inter@@ connected , it is not activated and is not used . filters are turned down from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be displayed further below the following setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; for the setup of character chain filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if this pattern is replaced in text , then the text will be replaced against the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filters . you can choose this name , it must only differ from the name of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replace it in accordance with the string of the column . the list will be removed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; Click here to move the selected word , or the regular expression in the list . &quot;
&quot; with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file , download the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered here , the filter is used only if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages here . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button . &quot;
&quot; if a value is registered here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . for example , you can enter several programs separated by com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID run programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus , the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only copy them . &quot;
&quot; the drawing chain filter is applied only to the text , when all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if applicable . are all input fields empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared with words , the drawing chain filter regular expressions use regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by part@@ itions ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
XML ; Trans@@ former translated &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in a different format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ formation . it can only be installed on well @-@ formed XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; using the speaker system , you can send texts to a certain speaker which is furnished on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can indicate that texts from k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; write a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that the program is selected to send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the speaker on the card speaker , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if the text is applied here , the filter is applied here , if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; regular use , you can access this with a click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to push the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here the properties of the desired filter conditions are determined here . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements at most . Click on the right to display dialogue speaker . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to store or delete your speaker settings , or delete all settings . &quot;
&quot; the speaker system is applied only to the text , if all conditions using an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if applicable . you must include at least one condition . &quot;
the language version API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD are added , such as &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language edition API of &amp; K@@ DE ; complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface between &amp; K@@ DE ; by the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text to read and option is a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . first run c@@ t@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to install S@@ able at all . if you do not need this voice to read the reading web pages , and make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
certain signs or inter@@ actions seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers so that all pro@@ positions will be ski@@ pped or just Caucas@@ ian . what can I do against it ?
&quot; first , make sure that the option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may possibly be fixed by a string of character filters . see . &quot;

&quot; the language syn@@ thesizer , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license which you will find in the related documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archives , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; download &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will find the source code from k@@ de@@ c under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / . &quot;
contains many languages available in a list of all currently supported languages at the htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / d@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
KT@@ TS works with every language syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consider the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you wish to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you can contact the developer team in connection . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including Pack@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ c , or download any night at the moment , translate , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if the language disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which is the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be so enhanced that the set of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dismant@@ led in individual sentences . the user can withdraw or devi@@ ate , repeat the output or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application has text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , it can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the issue . if you want to have a speaker , whose language is English and whose sex is female , this will be automatically the best right speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card speaker on adding , and that a speaker is displayed in the list or click on Edit , the card speaker device is displayed . as an example , the device card speaker is shown . for details on the modules you can find . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you must only enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text , which will be handed over to the festival . in general , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking that Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display this grey , the chosen voice is not able to display this settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these quotes already are syn@@ thes@@ ized with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first movement is syn@@ thes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have no speaker installed ( or forget to click on users ) . &quot;
&quot; this check@@ box is marked , when the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window is displayed . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr are still not running , it appears in the system area when K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text , so you have the opportunity to read or otherwise control the pre@@ ferences . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders in the qu@@ eue , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the application , the number of sets and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can select sat@@ in to the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr are reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the card card . see also . &quot;
here are only text orders shown and administ@@ rated . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and News will not appear . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either with support for the corresponding audio module , can &apos;t load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA , select the PCM device . see also : &quot;
place the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal operation speed . so this settings can be implemented so the program SO@@ X must be installed .
Click App@@ lic@@ t to adopt the new settings for the ongoing &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard . &quot;
&quot; on this card map you can set special actions , which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the screen of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other orders , and keep these orders . after the release of the screen reader is read , the received orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have priority priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes hot reserved . a warning keeps the output from news and normal text . this orders will continue after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &amp; eg ; just look forward a long text on a web page you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcoming the space .
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the waiting long . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the sound sound is active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played in front of the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card map are only valid for normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ emer@@ gen@@ us news , start a kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click Not@@ ification . the map noti@@ fications appears . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to switch the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and read ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , noti@@ fications are played , where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on button Add , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message for your nickname . &quot;
all events which are not specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
&quot; use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event takes place , you have the following selection options : &quot;
&quot; if you select a set @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard elec@@ ts the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker as the top record . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a certain event is defined for certain application , this action is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the specific application . as the last possibility comes the action to carry the action under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose you can define the pre@@ dat@@ ory messages as follows :
&quot; use the button store to store the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . the invited events will begin to load the events in the list . if you want to begin with an empty list , click delete . all entries except All Let &apos;s messages are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a speech output . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , the recording speed , the gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are present :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the standard voice is used in the SS@@ ML edition .
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch is not set at 100 n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &quot; htt@@ p : / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear ind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . as a result it can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , as only the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order , even if the language syn@@ thesizer cannot be supported directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal filters . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it will be automatically set up as a pro@@ positi@@ onal filter filter . you can add its settings or add additional proposition filters , but is de@@ classified . &quot;
&quot; easiest to learn the setup of the speaker selection . switch the speaker selection , select some properties and check how the selection of speaker is changed . if you have set the speaker selection , you need more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with reading can begin , since only the first movement must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long , &quot;
&quot; you then select text orders on the card card orders , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter will automatically be set automatically , if you start a kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off only . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ular de@@ mark ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the proposition ( tab@@ ular de@@ marks are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default proposition filters reserves the drawing composition .
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( k@@ g. ) , war@@ nings , news or the screen of screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter , you can insert this again by loading the in &amp; kt@@ ts ; contained file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the speaker graph , you can re@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : there are no sharing characteristics .
&quot; using the matching speaker , which has all the properties of a fully furnished speaking speaker . if you do not delete the att@@ itudes of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from which was originally set up originally . &quot;
&quot; select the method for entering the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the sel@@ ector buttons . &quot;
&quot; here , select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing . &quot;
&quot; check this check box , if the property should have priority before other features . you can also set several markings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding of the output , this feature is always defined as priority property . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language if you may know that a specific application was sent in a different language as the result of the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the speaker , which is to be clear to the following , click on the selection button , and then on speaker , which corresponds to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case 0 for the last text order in the qu@@ eue , you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is 0 required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was probably finished . probably , you have to register G@@ ST @-@ register 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio issue via AL@@ SA does not work when I play with another application music . when I get a word order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : to open PCM . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA will prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices . hin@@ ts for possible solutions can be found at the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org . &quot;
I have an additional voice for the festival on the Internet . I installed it and can &apos;t use it in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .

&quot; on the card map , there is a setting speed . so that it works , the program SO@@ X has to be installed and over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ations such as Festival Interactive provide a setup for speed . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read either the filters for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are completely cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML form filter , and put the microphone speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t create it to read pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER seems to function not . thus , the X@@ SL file throws the X@@ SL file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own drawing chain filtering , and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; not anymore in advance or go back . on the cart@@ on orders , orders are displayed only from a sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; mark signs ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) may not filter you . use a filter for this character instead of a pro@@ positi@@ onal detection . &quot;

&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer which is apparent source code . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for this voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice applies to festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions , they are looking for the first time on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; it produces the audio issue . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; no complete language selection system is . &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates these from &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German text di@@ phone . more information is available .
&quot; in this case , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ file is not installed in &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; file format , but in the folder / li@@ b / . instructions will be found under &quot;

Free@@ T@@ TS is a freelance language syn@@ thesizer which has been written in &amp; Java ; this means that you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . using &amp; Java ; you cannot change pitch , volume or microphone speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command to send the speech output into a temporary audio file ( wav ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio equipment . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the management of network interfaces , device and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings above a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; control center ; can be accessed by K Menu bar . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; bar menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is set at all and enables the setting of the network characteristics . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be added when installing and installed . network devices will be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the kernel version . &quot;
&quot; module interface is loaded when the network settings will be selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting module network , this system tries to automatically detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the h@@ ott@@ le selection is offered . it is best to choose from the list that the distribution and the release is best . due to marking the default settings , this selection will be automatically pre@@ set automatically . &quot;
&quot; the change of network settings are possible only in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed , which means the settings can only be viewed , the change mode is not possible . in the system management mode you can click on the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password mode . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the module &apos;s entire functionality is available . it is divided into three riders : &quot;
the rider network interface is used to manage the system &apos;s network devices . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed following :
the settings of the required network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button and click in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . Click the button to click the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; selecting Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server is used for the system simultaneously with the launch of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server is required for the system , therefore no further setting is required . in the sel@@ ective list can be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual , no D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be used as a TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not requested , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switching of a selected network device is accessed by selecting the list and click Interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off on the required network . turn off a activated network device via selection from the list and click Interface ...
&quot; if the IP address of the host is fixed in the local sub@@ net , the physical connection to remote networks and is used for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway computer is selected . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . that is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requires htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator to the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name solution enables a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a contract and hin@@ ts in the list with buttons or her@@ on . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button , adding a DNS @-@ server to the name solution , a DNS @-@ server can be added . the dialog will add new Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot;
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button Add . the entry is then inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group hosts to the name resolution , select one entry and then click on the button .... It will display the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of known calcul@@ ator describes host @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily during bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this still can replace the version of IP in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... The dialog New alias is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known host and add the button Add . if the known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , de button Add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box will be displayed .
&quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , it needs to be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be removed . &quot;
&quot; the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code . &quot;
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient , if &amp; K@@ DE , and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
&quot; the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package , and in a console ; with rpm , as follows : &quot;
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graph@@ ically surface like a package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient for this case , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are required . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technologies are given , in the second all are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changeable configuration files . &quot;
this area can not replace any further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is communic@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . the 5 has never found large spread . from IPv6 , this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is to be aware of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to provide a valid IP address . in any case , the IP address can not be selected . &quot;
&quot; when placing an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected for this purpose @-@ reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , hence their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be used for such machines through setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , mostly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 calcul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called Standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the standard route is required for IP transfer . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are filed in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file sometimes changed by DSL connections , so it is then not surprised when in the case of active DSL connections , a different content can be found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ ony . another level can be seen as expected . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a f@@ use program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a band . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which took the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , sel@@ ective un@@ pack . the second purpose was the answer of a question that my wife said : how much longer it takes , when you sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; get back the band and reads the pre@@ ten@@ se information of the band . recogni@@ zes &amp; dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ as on the band , you will be asked if the band is to be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
recogni@@ zes &amp; dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ell is looking for the appropriate index on your plate . cannot be found if the band index is to be created .
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the tape drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the ban@@ anas can now be searched for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the belt , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by a change of symbol for the band that the binding for the band has been solved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; dat ; &quot;
&quot; a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not conform to the form@@ att@@ ing on &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not need to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; it needs to be form@@ at@@ ted by the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; however , flo@@ ppy band drives are usually not set to use DA@@ T drives . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the band are lost , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the secured files . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree , only this file or folder is secured . &quot;
mark a coll@@ ision profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile .
mark files in the local file tree with one block . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folder will be secured .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click the local file @-@ tree and select in the menu Si@@ zes ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was launched , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialogue you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the files inside for the drive . only the selected file , or folder . &quot;
&quot; mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bun@@ k@@ hole . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked . &quot;
Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been launched , the dialog appears for review . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage it , the files , which are to be restored , must be marked . this can be done on two types : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
&quot; select the desired files from one of the archives with one block . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu . &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process has been launched , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the work folder for the restoration . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog appears re@@ inst@@ ated . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process , and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it is necessary to create the tape inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types from the band : &quot;
this will create a safety profile with the just selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a safety profile :
&quot; the current work folder , in which the backup should be made . the list of secured files will be automatically updated according to the selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all the file , which are listed under backup files , only the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . file that can be placed on other file systems . each entry is viewed by tar independently from the other . &quot;
&quot; conduct an incre@@ mental backup . in order to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files are assured that has been changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used for setting the changes since the last indirect use . &quot;
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be saved and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons &amp; gt ; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of the compilation of this documentation .
&quot; the settings can set you on the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu , you can make the following settings : &quot;
the complete path to the device node for the tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ rence version of the belt .
&quot; this attitude is active , transmit &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated the command to load on the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tried &amp; dat ; unlock the move on tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all band drives . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically cast off the band . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ size block size for the tape drive . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the name : seconds , the host name is the full name of the system , where the band is form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds , which has been de@@ form@@ at@@ ted since the period . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that are directly connected to &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar stuff should function as long as it does not deal with cre@@ denti@@ als .
examine the content of a safety line . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system or where the system can get information about your system or where the system allows the quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , which can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system files the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log enables users to provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some enhanced features which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log , a number of useful features include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included in addition to the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are available , with their help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual page . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; initially , the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol started . it will probably not appear on Linux . the protocol files are normally found in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually have no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or to filter strings . the list of log messages will now be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the selected filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns , the string search is included . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also select another record . the string of the filter search term is then selected only with entries in the corresponding column process . select the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all the protocol lines which have been sent or created from this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is activated in the default setting , and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a show@@ y color as protocol lines of level indication . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off . &quot;
&quot; if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on @-@ protocol ) , so you can also use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process as for example , to the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new coming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . in order to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the window . once you have selected a window , select a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the source management system log .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; also in the following folder des &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it System quickly develops to the standard for control of the program running at the high @-@ speed system in &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go down to historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to introduce a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installing and new format . that &apos;s why you have to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional file :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole amount of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service which you want to start with the system or change to another level level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be on the turn below / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ conf / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
&quot; the kernel is searching for different locations after the program in@@ it , and starts the first to find it . &quot;
the standard Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see line as the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change anything , then you &apos;ll get it manually by restart the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how do you start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d script . &quot;
how starts and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that it &apos;s an argument like start and stop accept . you can actually start using this scripts in fact from hand on command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script will be called by the argument . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have a server -@@ Run@@ level , that can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; b ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say not tri@@ vial : simply pull one entry from the area of the availability system services to one of the six Run@@ time level to start it on this level ( or stop to stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere . this will not only happen if it will come out from its original Run@@ level ( or his position ) , if it does not come out from the area of the availability system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved if you want to copy them into a new area . to select it only to a new run@@ level , you &apos;ll need to select from the menu Edit or from the context menu , even if the same entry already exists in the target range . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a entry cannot be calculated sometimes . in such a case , you must process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries , which were thrown into the paper@@ board . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the various working areas ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection upper - or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another track level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it to the desired lap level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change sorting or the name of a entry manually , press the tab button to switch between different fields . use the tab button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data losses , all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences are stored in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise it will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes in the settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have been experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single , and press the input key to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard running level on a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) . &quot;
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; provided under Run@@ level X but they are not executed .
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the species , such as system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , does not simpli@@ fy the configuration for proprietary integration programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately , no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution files , please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) should be just without a message when your configuration files are not connected or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you can use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level to make this manual be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ; to read .
&quot; after you have done changes , you must save these . either use the corresponding icon of the tool bar or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; user ; it &apos;s a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user groups . for editing , select the desired users or the desired group with double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group characteristics . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you have access the limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you will be able to make individual settings , if shadow passwords , or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed as in BSD uni@@ on@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the card password will appear if shadow passwords , or example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed as in BSD . &quot;
&quot; this card card is only activated , if for at least one embedded file system limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable in the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , the limitation limits can be changed in KB : &quot;
&quot; for each file system , these parameters can be set individually . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system . &quot;
&quot; the card group inform@@ s information about the group @-@ outs of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user is heard , you will find in the field of primitive group . furthermore , users can mark the user in other groups by marking this in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog box features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select from the user group or group or click on the matching add button of the tool bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the li@@ lo boot manager , remove the boot word , remove and change the time to the boats of standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more . &quot;
