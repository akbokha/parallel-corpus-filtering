<seg id="392">"automatic: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjustment the red, green and blue channels in the entire histogrammar area."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminous thickness of the RGB values of a picture by shifting the lowest and highest values in the widest range and a new jiv of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images, and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & digiate; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white-equal correction is somewhat limited to a colour space with 8-bit per color, so if you can perform the white-off in rough mode, which can be done in 16-bit mode, so you will get your ways to correction better."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digiate; produces three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces especially in dark areas, grainy paintings."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpens mask is working on the contrast of the edges in the contrast to the edges. actually, it's no little bit psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it is a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocus is possibly the best of the three, because it really improves the sharpness. it's a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitised images need a correction of sharpness. therefore, these elements are smaller than the resolution. the same phenomenon can be printed a little wounded. the same phenomenon can be printed on paper. SLR cameras will usually need more retroactive as normal cameras for the private application."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG image, an image of internal sharpening has been used. images in the rough size must always be screened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners make a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this deactivate, you will receive control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo of sharpening value. you can set up with the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should use it carefully because the results do not affect the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, you can achieve the most useful technology to sharpening the tool. below refocus, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution, the image is a bit soft to draw, is much easier than it to sharpness. use the tool for the softness with the menu entry. use the case on the right side of the dialogue."</seg>
<seg id="489">Filter Unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview can help you edit the picture. the presentation window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often tested. an increase of the radius, or the amount amplifies the effect. if you generate the impose mask to be strong, noise and impression of grates will create in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius presents a how many pixels on each side of a cante are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radials. they should therefore sharpens images at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB-value and the difference amount. it can therefore define a minimum difference for a cante of filters. in this way, areas will be avoided with a soft change between the killing of the sharpen and therefore the beauty of beauty in faces, heavens and water surface."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed picture (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a corporal value = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiate; General tools refocus refocfies a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted discharge filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to try a picture to & quot; refocsierquot; this is better approach than trying to try the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Vienna Filament. the traditional technology for sharpening images is the use of an impose mask. you can start it out of the menu by calling colors refocus on the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauge's runoff. the Gauge's ffolding has a very long tail, which does not affect the mathematical results far from the source pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. that causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular edge: this is the radius of the circular folding, it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture should be very unsharp then on Heiligenschema."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: the correlation can be reduced from 0-1. the correlation can be reduced from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1. however, values above is very bad. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is 0.03. a useful value is 0.03. a useful value is still more tightened."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauge's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauge's sharpness. use these parameters when your sharpenal resistance is caused. in most cases, you should allow this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation disk. if you have selected great results for the circular edge or the Gauss's sharpness, please note that the module is very slow if you select great values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"store as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameter is set, so that it may be saved for later and then can be charged."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to carry all cuts, color and intensity structures in the picture before you can use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible, but then leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read pictures and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masked better results as sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masked a bigger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to produce unsharp masked forever. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharper filter. it is virtually the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the insharper mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">"below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour picture has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for further information regarding the methods for sharpening correction in digital images, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the controller glitter sets the sharpening of the range, in order to create a more natural pupille."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the tintinte makes a customized colour for the Pupille. if you want a blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different settings as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth glitter above the picture. a value of 0.9 ought to receive details that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details should always be arranged according to correcting movement."</seg>
<seg id="520">"correcting movement alpha [0,100]: a small value smooth evenly into all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film gradation or a CCD catches, a high value of fibre can produce similar patterns. JPEG Artefacts will be best at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum glassment factor above alling.p then defines the relative incendices. therefore, put this value for the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, as it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence', it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is running through. normally 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angular length da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha small is selected, then it should also be small to produce a long runtime. so you should choose that small angle should be a long runtime. so you should choose this value so far as possible and choose your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"stepper span [0,1, 10]: integral stepper span in pixels. you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel glaring and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more on quality you get through the option of this option is only low. but he doubles the runtime. therefore we recommend it therefore.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons save as and loading make exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image errors is comparatively very fast to work. however, it can still last very long and a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button."</seg>
<seg id="529">"below, you can see like picture error with little artifacts. the module is shown on a photo that has been created in Guatemala City with an analogous camera that is caused by a poor film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and corrected the image below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiants; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce frame control. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove spots and other artifacts that are coming from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moirecounts; -effects of collected images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in English in this tutorial."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the lower window details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain at default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is needed for the filter. great values increase the time the filters per pixel is needed and can be used by the radius and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpening distance. this value sets the pixel angle of the filter to the front look around luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details do not get more and noise or lubricate occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, you cannot remove the whole space or noise level. put it to a value near the maximum if you want a weak noise or JPEG artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance olerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. this settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. this settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the tolerance tolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically are stronger, however, also the shadow ranges."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of the phasenjittering absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius can appear on variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smooth and phasenjitter are visible on the edges. it can remove sound tips and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">"store under and store: these buttons are used as well. all parameters for the noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later recharged."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change their lives. the original pattern is marked with (1) and corrected (2). the noise reduction was applied to default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crispy for your purpose. the solution, the image is a bit soft to draw, is fortunately much easier than one picture to sharpen. use it to the softmark on the right side of the dialogue it shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiate; photo restoring is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo artefts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artefacts of your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove turmowers, film grafts, scratches, compressive file and local mistakes which makes content such as the human eye."</seg>

<seg id="1043">"& Povray; used a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these mistakes. generally, pictures with this feature is better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you switch anti-aliasing, computes and links & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is still divided and adaptive because of the calculated colour values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray is a beam of pixels. if the difference between the color values will be adjusted to the limit value, both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with a value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be traced individually and further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. when you turn jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of titles. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo systems with high quality."</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute top quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with Kodierprograms, there is often a combination of programming settings for the codiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the code explain the switch for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to be encoded with lame (English: day) if MP3s must be encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudioCreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters which can be used (= Knopfitter in Assistance):</seg>

<seg id="1661">"in this section, as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the DC sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in correct sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and do not leave line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all the tones that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (e.g. with sound 60), you can do a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which can be similar to a rifle (e.g. with sound 60), which allows you to do the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"if now, a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (rifle signal), it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you must only use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the percolon channel. check out as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to share the first and second channel, do it simply in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"in this case, the keyboard is used on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be defined using the name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, you will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the ForcePatch option can be useful for example, to always use the percolt patch on the Perkal channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied. if so, a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event, and then it is only forwarded to the value of 4096, so that in the Map file there will be no decimal number."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM is going to play a keyboard, which is a Pitch-Bender event, with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards up to a octave higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you'll need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in cron-protocol), so you can also use the process identification (PID) in the column process as for example, to the start of the Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new coming protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. in order to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the window. once you have selected a window, select a protocol on display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum software.org. Dort you will find more current information about the source management system log.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also in the following folder des & KDE; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init System quickly develops to the standard for control of the program running at the high-speed system in & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go down to historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to introduce a machine on System V Init, without a reinstalling and new format. that's why you have to ensure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following additional file:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole amount of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service which you want to start with the system or change to another level level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services such as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be on the turn below / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also do a rc.conf / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">"the kernel is searching for different locations after the program init, and starts the first to find it."</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change anything, then you'll get it manually by restart the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how do you start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d script. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that it's an argument like start and stop accept. you can actually start using this scripts in fact from hand on command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script will be called by the argument. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have a server -Runlevel, that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & b; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say not trivial: simply pull one entry from the area of the availability system services to one of the six Runtime level to start it on this level (or stop to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere. this will not only happen if it will come out from its original Runlevel (or his position), if it does not come out from the area of the availability system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved if you want to copy them into a new area. to select it only to a new runlevel, you'll need to select from the menu Edit or from the context menu, even if the same entry already exists in the target range."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a entry cannot be calculated sometimes. in such a case, you must process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the paperboard. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the various working areas (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection upper - or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another track level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired lap level with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change sorting or the name of a entry manually, press the tab button to switch between different fields. use the tab button to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data losses, all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are stored in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise it will be saved by & ksysv. changes in the settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have been experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the lilo -Prompt linux single, and press the input key to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard running level on a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; provided under Runlevel X but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the species, such as system services are launched in these distributions, does not simplify the configuration for proprietary integration programs of these distributions, but unfortunately, no standard. the authors of & ksysv, are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution files, please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) should be just without a message when your configuration files are not connected or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you can use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel to make this manual be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have done changes, you must save these. either use the corresponding icon of the tool bar or the entry save in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& user; it's a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, user and user groups. for editing, select the desired users or the desired group with double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have access the limitation (Quota) for users, you will be able to make individual settings, if shadow passwords, or example / etc / master.passwd can be installed as in BSD unionts."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the card password will appear if shadow passwords, or example, / etc / master.passwd can be installed as in BSD."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card card is only activated, if for at least one embedded file system limitation (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable in the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, the limitation limits can be changed in KB:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">"for each file system, these parameters can be set individually. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card group informs information about the group-outs of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user is heard, you will find in the field of primitive group. furthermore, users can mark the user in other groups by marking this in the big field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog box features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select from the user group or group or click on the matching add button of the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works."</seg>
