although I visited the United States since 2012 at least once a year I would now live for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extremely large .
&quot; how many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I &apos;ve been dancing American music , read American writers and worked for his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less reporter who covered his mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy with the help of Julia Roberts , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Court with judges who wanted his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is absolute Truth , forget all others , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the U.S. only . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in whom I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting , that you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even had a very bad love letter on his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the host@@ ile and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow @-@ die .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he is saying exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague , express it , and publicly declared his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americ@@ er and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his testimony and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections , was the highest number that ever reached a party candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person asked me ?
I could not know Tr@@ ump and his voters do not agree with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , people from all over the world , with whom I managed to enter@@ tain me about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ uman &apos;s world@@ view was also voted by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for their lives , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; yet it fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er Council helped me a lot of my career . &quot;
these people and those affected by them em@@ bodied my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump is a way to nomin@@ ate Republican Presi@@ dential candidate , they offered me a halt and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the Presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps not due to its contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they were either sharing r@@ ump and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke me . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call Tr@@ ump elec@@ tors as R@@ assi@@ sten .
&quot; to as@@ sign the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and suggests an in@@ ability to understand those who deal with another way , and think . &quot;
&quot; it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears will not be taken into account in their communities . &quot;
&quot; could it be that these elec@@ tors , from which most knows are , for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to recover control over a country they are disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps . maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down differently with contemp@@ t upon those who look differently . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( bed of the WC . : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; &quot; word from white in play to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as much as ch@@ and@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the big Van Jones , exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which belief or background it may always have America , America is every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of an Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with poly@@ gons , religious freedom and the entire concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the rest of the rest . &quot;
&quot; at all I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who is in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a rally for Hillary Clinton had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud voice , &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; ro@@ aring the crowd . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were loud .
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and strong &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan completed his words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; that music , which is played in both places , has not only changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the church : one of the children and adults of existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found an opportunity for over@@ coming the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drugs and abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , after a random encounter with a French pilot , a musical project started and the youth had always offered a rare hop@@ el@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations toward the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they come and play with shining eyes and play in the tur@@ tle you will learn a day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically above the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - based on instruments which are made of recur@@ sive waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ adily prepared instruments , made from local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under the management of Fa@@ vio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of the waste in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments offered viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian and Latin American music as well as the Beatles music , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio ChÃ¡vez reminds of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , on the starting time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash , the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown that he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
&quot; today there is a complete orchestra , which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) features the musical performance :
&quot; every year , the world produces about a billion metric tons of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the troubles - as people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational play from garbage to music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild fishing struggles .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to shared use .
&quot; at that time , in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia before leaving the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were raised and slightly incl@@ ined to welcome a dem@@ entia of this kind in their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the directors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised quickly against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to share it a fishing licence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; suddenly , the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused anything , &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan f@@ isheries authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship during the day . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it did not succeed to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to the pl@@ undering of the country &apos;s stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; apart from Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are the six countries that then had exp@@ elled the Premier of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and working together . they exchanged information and stand on each other where it goes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts En@@ ding illegal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : the illegal fishing is hidden because it is extremely difficult to touch it . this is illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate abuse of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and types are to be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can have balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the snow@@ fall emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions happen nowadays in real time , tra@@ ce@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists existing licenses to susp@@ ect news about susp@@ icious activities or details , which one noticed or experienced during a harbour spec@@ tion . &quot;
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea through satellite data .
&quot; this enables the authorities to detect ships to fish in the banned areas - such as susp@@ icious driving routes , such as susp@@ ects that a ship invites his own caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show if the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then use the assumption of such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships cannot be sold off their cargo . and that even the numbers of pen@@ alties could be forced , as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing catch is not worthwhile anymore . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ ally supported for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform has been created to win estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fisher@@ man , who penet@@ rate in East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing tra@@ ys that attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these are the same illegal fisher@@ man .
&quot; among other things , actions include such actions as the sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of ph@@ antom en@@ ames , fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you are targeted specifically to use the missing international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ mosquito control system , &quot; &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; formerly a ship could not fishing and a country could say &apos; You must not run my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and just this leg@@ ale hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
&quot; to date , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 examinations . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that were fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it vol@@ atile ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing through large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ ects even more precise ships . &quot;

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be enhanced and helps to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Chef Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO who also deals with f@@ isheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , which can &apos;t be used by satellites . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information carriers . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of afri@@ can actually take influence on the un@@ question@@ ably global issue of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Reserve Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world by using any tra@@ ce@@ able ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of it , who knows what to do - that &apos;s simply sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system destroy the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only sense crimin@@ als , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that previously f@@ aded without license and hardly have consequences with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i involved a 33 % increase in fishing revenues , since fishing boats can buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board to@@ wing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study project . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , we will disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force in 2015 . it is also fighting the illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; using security is the goal of being able to produce more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member states in Somalia could report its first major triumph in October : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was used without license , which are now banned in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; the ship was still prohibited in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the provision of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed to illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time , evidence shows that such special , collabor@@ ative study to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes were the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the Order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate will also lead in other parts of the country - among others in the MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira in the central ski country of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ a .
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by a acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; but ultimately the post@@ ure of a new choice was blocked by the official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in the latest articles in the context of the government in this context : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation of inflation and ge@@ ste@@ ers belong to the highest on all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a gra@@ ce@@ ful and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine , the referendum was to re@@ take the chance to re@@ take its institutional structures and join a new government alliance . &quot;

particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located north @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , protest@@ ers return to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira cannot bear coats , because you could see anything else that many nation@@ alities do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , a Inf@@ ographic shows the round , which forms the extent of oppression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the claim after a counter@@ part procedure - this was now proved in the eyes of many through the presence of many people in the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs found :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ feit .
here is your counter@@ part !

&quot; others have made these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which in their sight has gained little against the devastating economic crisis and rather busy , critical voices to be ab@@ stain@@ ed : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are always taking more frequency and intensity .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba . &quot;
&quot; as meanwhile , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano as part of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in CÃ³rdoba province of Cordoba . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were investig@@ ating crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not been looking for his life .
&quot; starting with the office , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he retained the family re@@ sec@@ rec@@ y for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that was fine . &quot;
I felt like an obe@@ dient .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not know that my father was a thief , fol@@ klore , and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie officials . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was a deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ ano , the oppressed , accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who knew the magn@@ itude of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Bundes@@ court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent on his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went into the sports hall . there I had been with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father and some days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a ass@@ hole , you have redeemed you with one from the ERP . &quot;

&quot; therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be obe@@ dient . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had raised me .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; all possible documents : university degrees , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da the prisoners will be tortured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first time , he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply all possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a ceiling p@@ umping , and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he interpreted an open room and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I was paraly@@ zed , and saw a song that were tortured on man . &quot;
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it fortified the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was found there .
&quot; they caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shot him with water , and pursued a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the bases there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same od@@ our came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were p@@ inn@@ ed with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and were bound to bind them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indicted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a range of matt@@ resses , on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people still kept silence on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father said I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; Why do you gu@@ ise so , ass@@ hole ? &quot; &quot;
I met &quot; Why have you brought me anything else ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; they were thrown into a pit , and killed by soldiers and buried them . &quot;
&quot; I know this , because my father was at home . &quot;
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed a man .
&quot; according to the survivors of the Civil War Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , who was also accused of the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , where the ab@@ duc@@ ts come here . &quot;
&quot; look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the process . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the order came from above that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war zones are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign , which one receives an enemy , which one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I asked myself , like my father , head of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I answered : and you , which you beat cars on the street ? &quot;
you are no crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you , and bring you strange . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
that was my father .
I have no sole memory to him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me to have been a criminal case with this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me on the load what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to say .
&apos; the dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ous act .
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel better . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one can recognize the value of one life . &quot;
one further develops and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; so good , you were ex@@ cre@@ ted during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but for what the bodies van@@ ish ? &quot;
why do children lead ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have just been able to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but to let the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
had these people not even families who were able to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
&quot; the dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ red act , which one can do a man . &quot;
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced again , they used machinery to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disp@@ osed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything stays forever .
I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
only to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the idea to show my father was created during a meeting , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the abomin@@ ations I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I did not kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly , and asked me , for what the whole led patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended themselves were well . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I forgive myself . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I re@@ im@@ ed the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can tell me that I am vo@@ iced . I finally have said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest below the end of the trial in May 2015 .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish rules of the verdict .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppressed for crimes against humanity was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced in 28 cases , sentenced to life sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were hands @-@ free . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape by ministers . # Es@@ war@@ rior @-@ terrorism &quot;
&quot; during the dictatorship of the military , all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military members , former police officers and civil employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the wel@@ d chamber :
La Per@@ la was designed to make a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for many years to justice for the victims . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government transferred the country to La Per@@ la that a memorial could be erected there , which is now managed by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence . &quot;
the picture was dis@@ semin@@ ated in social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Kyoto town of Kyoto , customers have a newly opened centre where you can extend his driving licence , last month witnesses of a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word ( co@@ her@@ in@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older car driver , &quot; - maybe even with Boh@@ em@@ at@@ am@@ o@@ we &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; fear@@ ful car driver &quot; was translated . &quot;
the false translation was read on electronic ads from 1 to 20 September in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; elabor@@ ation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been divided into social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also attentive to the local newspapers . &quot;
the conservative daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation of translation .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ t@@ ful English translation was first removed initially . the name &quot; &quot; Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible car driver &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate as well as the gramm@@ ati@@ cal name &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police pre@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the defect errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text , which they had been reviewed by the translator , and that the translation was not checked on their correc@@ t@@ ness before being published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we &apos;re sorry that older people felt through the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News provided some more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older car driver in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; fear@@ bar &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved in accidents , but quite the occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of seniors . this equ@@ ates to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this gives its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents caused accidents in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ es@@ ent non @-@ known reporter brought to the version of the article comments to the light , showing the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese , seem@@ ingly against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation error has received the following comments :
- &quot; Is it ( &quot; fear@@ ful car driver &quot; ) do not mean the reality ?
&quot; - &quot; &quot; how wrong is the translation , actually , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that it is a true translation error .
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation is varied .
&quot; one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text , and active language skills to transmit it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in the case of native speakers . in general the conviction that translator should not be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language .
&quot; for example , a French mother tongue should translate the French translation by English - not from the French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no employees working with English as a mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may be due to mis@@ understanding , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers who want to learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that have no foreign workers , leave translations , nevertheless , the Japanese staff , whose English language is considered the best , for trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ential and en@@ ig@@ matic sets that arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique can still not replace human trans@@ lators . this applies to several languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , often used to decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for st@@ ili@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless . however , by major companies or by the government that have funding to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and interest measures on the Internet and Television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , the Venezuel@@ an Internet user would not have access to the online station Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
later other users wrote that Internet access by V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are not access@@ able anymore .
other online broad@@ caster over@@ took pictures of the protests in Caracas that were organised by op@@ positions groups that oppos@@ e the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred to the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was che@@ ek@@ ed , and recommended the Us@@ ers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Z@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages should be locked once again .
this is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offerings including Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ itated with the reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened to report on them with fin@@ es and closure , when the Commission would continue to report on the demonstrations as the &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed myself with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible by a lock of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two more online broad@@ caster . this also applies the website where the National Assembly passes their meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous post @-@ resear@@ ches of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider does not use DNS . this is a technique via the DNS servers in@@ quiries of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers error or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ Y@@ PI@@ TV and @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked canal , was stopped on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman was Elvis Flo@@ res , who had taken live protests in Caracas . &quot;
Flo@@ res was beaten while he was in custody for a police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back on the show . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible from YouTube , the government was also reported that the government &apos;s Internet connections are regulated : thus , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians will continue to have access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slave to get a training . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina for the rights of children and colle@@ cts records other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report by shor@@ tw@@ ave , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the friendly auth@@ orization of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re@@ published . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where she was not in common with the family that was living there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her degree of studies at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . when Cri@@ ad@@ itas is known to work in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money , giving her younger son or her min@@ ors daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned , is that the children can afford countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse of abuse - and all that in the context of a contract you cannot lift . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , the practice described as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after finishing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected stuff , re@@ cher@@ ished and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name the things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude to vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who make their daughter in the faith that they can improve their position in the society and make something out of themselves , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , which takes the girl with itself , and its exploitation by faith just@@ ifies that they would give someone chance that would not get any training , and maybe even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will find out many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experienced them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon that is taking place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , their body showed traces of great slaughter . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita &apos; household belonging to Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official at the hab@@ itable organisation .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira struck up as long as they suffered a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered dead injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported over the incident .
they emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society ro@@ oted practice of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest together and demanded that there will be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
&quot; the neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organizations called a significant investigation of the case . &quot;
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , for the murder of the girl who , her Cri@@ ad@@ ita , was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be a landmark case - when the first time in the story of Paraguay is a case of cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go before the court . &quot;
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as a labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in her age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , bank@@ rupt , and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all , and began selling sweets on the street or on the market conf@@ ection@@ ery to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
&quot; in their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time so that you still got time to learn . &quot;
she stood in every morning against five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; on Fri@@ days , for example , they pur@@ ged the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and the infected ground . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she came home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more time it was ready with learning , the more time it had free time . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she remembers . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the good@@ man , a H@@ ali@@ br@@ arian military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; on some evenings of the house@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; he kept her for intelligent , but kept not with her . &quot; the good@@ man had found someone who heard , while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn there again &quot; bad habits , &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ to speak at home again their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the education they had to lose it again , she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , it was totally clear that they had paid for everything they had paid from them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated in school , too . &quot; one thing about which almost never talked about , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the Sch@@ ik@@ anas , whom Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clearly that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society budget the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share opportunities for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administ@@ rators of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ on district . &quot;
&quot; hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her . &quot;
learn to learn .

Bill is writing Egyptian users social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed a bill to &quot; the regulations regarding the use of social networks and social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users and users of social media must be registered in Egypt by a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; based on the law , then a place would be set up in order to provide permission to share social media , citizens and citizens . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , user would have to register users with their right names and personnel numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or cash . &quot;
&quot; the bill , composed of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application which is running on the internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when it is assumed , since the design cannot be imposed , as Egyptian authorities do not plan to register the user that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul saddle , parliamentary committees and sponsors of the law en@@ forcement , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to them , it would be necessary to submit information to the Egyptians , to access the network . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not known that such plans exist . &quot;
experts and experts are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Assistant &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I doubt greatly in the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things , which have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it is like that they could control physical public and private spaces can also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then it means that they can submit a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not . and that is a mad system to monitor the activities of people , and also to bring it to a trial . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must initially be deb@@ ated at the legislative elections and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ Hawai@@ y proposed a legislative situation against Cy@@ ber crime in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those who had been found guilty of threatening to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the nor@@ theastern Iraq , the veter@@ ans H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the Indian Persian Leop@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards that takes place through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wild bo@@ oming , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , because they are always less prey . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; how R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; is the Persian Leopard , the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in fact is small and goes against zero . when the team is therefore fixed , that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera that breaks R@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , documented in the northeast Japan daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re @-@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung lies in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . pre@@ fecture Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a certain pre@@ f@@ ect ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced evacu@@ ated ; for the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal towns from the map .
&quot; in addition to this , Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local point of view which progress in progress six years after the life of local communities .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building agency and the survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses ( in the area of the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed . &quot;
&quot; the greatest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could be Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 per cent of the planned spare time were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is the final light . &quot;
&quot; still , six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by hom@@ el@@ age accommodation ( in the area of the war , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , they are still trying to settle in final spare buildings . &quot;
&quot; after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in comfort accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , more than 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima in 2011 live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated ones who were travelling according to the disaster in comfort houses were converted into final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the stand of work and daily life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by evil , their gates are open until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of f@@ isheries airports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of f@@ isheries airports have recovered its operation . &quot;
tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident have drawn into the three pre@@ f@@ ect con@@ tours of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear waste , for only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the nuclear pl@@ ywood zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ect ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered extensively , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can only be 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their lives . &quot;
is the native population prepared to the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total image , the newspaper conducted numerous question@@ ings under the local population and among the evacu@@ ated by . she asked them about the stand of reconstruction and even as you find , opposite the tsun@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a questionnaire to bring more about tsun@@ ami consciousness below the local population .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and tsun@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in the disasters prevention . &quot;
&quot; as it stands to those who evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , &quot;
&quot; in its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has increased their attention also to the position of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima has not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phic @-@ caused , atomic accident , who ever had to participate . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people , returned to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , moved into permanent spare time . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 state of 2017 , there are still more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the evacu@@ ation areas are most of the evacu@@ ated ones that are still in Beh@@ ol@@ fs@@ hausen , more than 50 years old . in order to rep@@ ay the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima , they are competing for building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that are part of the Tokyo Olympic Games . &quot;
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries , which speak a different language , the differences appear to be larger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognize that one more combines than it appears at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global compounds are important , since they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices po@@ d@@ cast , we look forward to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep po@@ d@@ cast we deal with topics that often get fewer attention than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Eg@@ her@@ man says about the time in rural China ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time where she has worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experience which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive care station : last Friday , a police officer had defeated him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . millions of protest@@ ers participated in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the federal university of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ ctions . &quot;
doctors accredited him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread themselves within a few days quickly in Brazil . &quot;
the pictures of the police have also seen the face of the police officer . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; following the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the previous service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; would take a police officer of a demonstr@@ ators and landing on intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the whole oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video in the net , where you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer , and several sanitary shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , filmed from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in the shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus down from the 50th second . &quot;
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to be able to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;

the villages of forgotten villages in Cuba
the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso closed nearly hundreds of sugar factories throughout Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
&quot; the Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no notable sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar production were l@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; after the rise there was still the sugar industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the smells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be found ane@@ w .
some changed the work .
others re@@ signed and comm@@ ute every day to the factories that still grin@@ d .
&quot; N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar industry is not rough his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar production , he returned to operation after long in@@ active time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remembers precisely that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory but the promise was not kept .
&quot; the sugar industry resistance already resistance the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad appointments are already no new@@ ness anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar industry disabled ?
the old railway platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
&quot; the refin@@ ing of the sugar industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 euros ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the small productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations , and the sugar crisis in the global market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about one decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds , according to the 2016 report by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day &apos;s day will go into history with security into history , &quot; which was the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the lact@@ ation of a total of 98 sugar mills , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the Sug@@ ro@@ ir Factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as a soldier is known about the closure of the factory , is the word that he is repeated most , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first day of the year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written for documents related to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ sat and the date were distinguished . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could give every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility was over@@ coming and the letters became increasingly more common . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the set factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still living in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved with his will at the breast@@ feeding of the factory , where he helped , involved . &quot;
&quot; with each part , which he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial sector in Cuba and the most important job producers were extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases no alternatives for the work@@ places and services , which were generated in the municipalities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw that , as he guaranteed , that for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years , everything would run smoothly . &quot;
&quot; the price of the population for the closure of the sugar production , &quot;
sugar cane has been extracted only high since 2004 .

&quot; after two years , the Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar factory ended , or rather , when they began to susp@@ end it , they also stopped to asph@@ alted the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene was back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty Harvest are bringing a retirement of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is no subsequent person , nevertheless he gives the lies that one told him not . &quot;
they tor@@ pe@@ es him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes to retirement for 65 years , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bit@@ tered . &quot;

first Nations young people use hip hop to express and get their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; you@@ ths of the first Nations communities in all Canada are involved with topics that are important for them . they do with hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshops have been working directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues to David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in our conversations issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever it comes into the sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ neb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the ancest@@ ral area in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also known as &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were generally not explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ ati Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to mediate , as important to the traditional S@@ itten and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in Indian languages , although the young people did not always master the languages of the first Nations languages . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation recorded , the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young@@ sters involved a little help of Gary J@@ olly of the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in a tran@@ script , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel when nobody ever got interested in me ?
but I try to go on my days on the earth
&quot; that is the day , in which you will take our cry , &quot;
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
&quot; but I believe , that we will rise one day &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; so , they can grow and also prior to our youth . &quot;
&quot; thus , they can do what is intended for the creator . &quot;
&quot; in the comment , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also features a post and adds the verse in Sil@@ ben@@ z ( which is also published on his blog and re@@ published here with permission ) : &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , you will be exposed to the sho@@ res of sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( , &quot; &quot; Plast@@ ics models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) from every dish which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see this plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small companies that use the plastic dishes , which the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders had documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; most of the Japanese are these plastic dishes as usual , they do not even invite them to them . however , a new trend is turned into current mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets today . &quot;
near Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic dishes , decorated cell bands , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection , as in this case , refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the ess@@ ences will increasingly be elabor@@ ated .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we have also produced this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
&quot; and here is an apple , holding your mobile phone : &quot;
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into coma .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon che@@ ated are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can make my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing che@@ ated ? &quot;
I think I &apos;ll probably be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleas@@ antly . &quot;
our latest mobile phone support has the form of mel@@ ody .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and handmade salmon from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further qu@@ ir@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen below : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # ( , as in the end of the h@@ ash@@ tag # ) , &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi which is devoted to the popularity of the restaurant industry . such as with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of fighting against drug dealers , &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ chie@@ fs and gear@@ ings occur regularly in statistics . however , these mir@@ ro@@ red the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings together . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ ells , urged the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; a day after a violent incident , anyone looks after a violent or on the communities that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every sin@@ king , behind every bone was in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds might never be cure . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade live ) that this victims will give a voice and stories of people who were in the fight between prosecution and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime makes us not only fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if shops include because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers , and whole municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ vi@@ que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear@@ ful life changes &quot; ) tells these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guad@@ alu@@ pe , a father who is searching for a secret graves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father only one day , her four sisters , her husband and two . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare for the job today , which we have set ourselves , go and go to the graves after the people we loved . &quot;
Guad@@ alu@@ pe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also with me here . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not get paid out because they demand a dying . &quot;
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explains why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we have to show the international community of conflicts , frag@@ ility and government management . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a writer of animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never see violence as normal , no matter what shape it occurs : &quot;
I have been able to know the disease and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism since a couple of years .
I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with images that are actually only from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one , I am disgu@@ sted or sad . it works as a lack of respect opposite the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be equal or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin thinks he &apos;s great . and it is not normal that people listen to the &quot; hel@@ pl@@ aten &quot; of the off@@ ender , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened too . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , if stories to be blo@@ wn numbers in a statistic . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ action of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified , that they were &quot; w@@ alled . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to talk to themselves , that they are sp@@ ared from such trage@@ dies , when they are not stirring and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months Er@@ press@@ ant in the main city district : like a family with threats of threats . it describes how armed crimin@@ als was destroyed for month of money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you &apos;ve lost and remember how many people can completely change your whole lives in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes away , the sad@@ ness remains , the fear comes back again if you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers also changed . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we walk from each other , the better . &quot;
she completed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , if weeping would dissolve my profound feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the second generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it possible to rise in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other young ones of his age , whose parents take care of her . &quot;
&quot; Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to live an egg , potatoes , tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence , and who had to learn to live thereby . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was already over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody suffering of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a driving car . &quot;
&quot; when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like that : &quot;
Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder of civil security and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 murders . this equ@@ ates to an average of 8,5 murders per day . &quot;
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and enters into the soul of the country .
&quot; only few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who we don &apos;t forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; project , Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against the drug trade which has tortured the country in the past four decades . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is worth a thousand in@@ true words , &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he links , includes images , which is represented on the force . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment , in which it comes to lift up a rum@@ or or a fake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years di@@ pped for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , incl@@ ines to exist further . &quot;
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ leading to be used to imag@@ ined trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - Don &apos;t deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker wag@@ ons the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been negle@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become a dangerous pile of impact that were difficult to be@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the Tank@@ wagen fell victim to the victims . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ den@@ ier described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses included , including a cinema near , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the Football World Cup . &quot;
houses for@@ ged and for@@ ged bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the im@@ perfec@@ tion@@ ality .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 . January 201@@ 5. more photos of the incident form the atro@@ cious scenes of this day . &quot;
the above is an example .
&quot; it shows the rows of carbon@@ ized body , which are spread on the ground during persons . &quot;
but here the story does not find her end .
&quot; over the years the same photo exp@@ ires several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , but may not be attributed to the related trage@@ dies , especially in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what was not in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ ak@@ ian towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
&quot; e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , before they had to flee . &quot;
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were burned down in streets and bones .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a resident on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were broken , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only based on satellite images , the follow @-@ up period was illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army of army in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here , the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as soon as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris , two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ rupt use of the image from the DR Congo is just one in a number of failure ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for massacres . &quot;
&quot; even one step further bring personal comments , such as the example from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange was also in relation to the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash@@ light , published by the United Nations those who were able to flee battles , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , po@@ sts like the following , who brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture is taken from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which had said in 2012 , said the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an His said , monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to images this information . &quot;
&quot; the original subscription , which was last updated on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AFP as their source called , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ an His testimony , but had not taken the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; the worldwide operating range of fal@@ tering , &quot;
&quot; traces of these false c@@ utt@@ ings are coming back to 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from anywhere across the world . &quot;
&quot; using a &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; a reverse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has been found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mix of private sites , platforms social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , have others tried to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s . &quot;
&quot; we have drawn examples of the ab@@ used use and brought them in connection with the respective countries , based on which page they had been published . by doing so , we want to represent the range clearly as through the language . &quot;
&quot; from the listed countries ( which were also associated with each other ) , several examples of ab@@ used use can be used . &quot;
here are some cases that can still be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ets of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries indicate pages or server , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ cons are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples , according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available above the Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this post , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City is not only the counter@@ feit , but also inform@@ s the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions according to the int@@ entions of the persons and the written trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los c@@ rist@@ i@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in Nord @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( which is not known whether the original report contained the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; wit@@ ty contributions after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this here , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who resi@@ sts this . &quot;

&quot; an association of the students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to the support of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency Nas@@ im , and used for illustr@@ ative the image of the DR Congo . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example for an ab@@ rupt use of the image from the DR Congo , with one part of a twe@@ eter , the sympathy to the Nig@@ erian slaughter , and on the other hand a blo@@ gger , the claims that the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , the claims that the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in Myanmar , the Government of Myanmar released a correc@@ t@@ ance to create the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this passage , which only appeared in English , also includes references to counter@@ feit images of rum@@ ours that kill H@@ ate Spe@@ ech , and used by extrem@@ ist groups to present that Muslims Budd@@ hi@@ sts kill and otherwise ( which is often administered by Bur@@ m@@ eric nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , who set itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo is NOT allowed to kill Muslims . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an His 2012 cleared out that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic @-@ related news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly stated that the image is not deri@@ ded by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ p attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the DR Congo &apos;s image appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events , which were suspected in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture has been cam@@ oufl@@ aged as proof for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages that were related to no religious context were taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the objective to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ erian massacre was in circulation , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to the counter@@ feit . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy , where the DR Congo &apos;s image was included , the organization of Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; the Tin@@ Eye , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and perhaps China are also available on other accounts recei@@ vers , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries . &quot;
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ eline ) exist on the web@@ cra@@ wler and unite them about image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )

&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( fl@@ avo@@ ids ) , which are under@@ going through this posts . the first frame focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions on silence in the context of Muslims with Muslims or Muslims - the Muslims of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fres@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; but a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can no longer give these images longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are countless people who have un@@ intended to share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ars this mood of false and fal@@ cons , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that this is rec@@ eding from images of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims itself . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern is that violent pictures of readers and viewers are des@@ iring to feel emp@@ athy for them ( such as this study , exam@@ ining how violent media can work on it others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some more violent represent@@ ations in news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will have to think about the situation in which a picture can be slightly sug@@ gar , but in which a picture can be used from the context or completely ab@@ used species . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false grants should also be considered internationally as internationally . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. in@@ descri@@ b@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer voice @-@ enthusiastic selection of words from all over the world to be difficult or not to translate .
&quot; such words exist in each language : you press some situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these in@@ descri@@ b@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ oth@@ esa ) .
but all contradic@@ tions stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of an easy translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes something context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on little languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find the words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Get your parents in recognition of how to have been trying for you in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which you feel after being heated in cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they ent@@ lessly grin@@ ded other cultures , reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to show more of this &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; , which are greatly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is considering the worst floo@@ ding and earthquake disaster in this decade .
&quot; the mon@@ soon , who normally en@@ camp@@ ed at the end of May are caused by strong rain@@ falls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following a statement by the cat@@ astro@@ us centre of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slaughter . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and roughly 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe residence . &quot;
&quot; the rain@@ falls dropped on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water fires in some areas went back slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene ratios of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos con@@ vey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water area of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .

&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus in the floods , water level up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a river . &quot;
&quot; the air force has five planes for rescue transactions , and another five are made for transport deliveries in their flooded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start@@ ups have also explained to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on high water situation and humanitarian assistance .

for all those who want to don@@ ate dry food and food @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -

&quot; the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; appro@@ .@@ Dam@@ as in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trusted her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we call for the women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head towel high , bound from an American flag , other channels against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , right ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years , they separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in its imagination . &quot;
they mus@@ cled me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim to be Muslim . but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are mus@@ cled . &quot;
un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed become un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t get alone .
that is even the poet that poetry is selling in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as a Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i , I was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ xer , Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day where he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western performance the religion was deleted Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduced images of Muslims who had been colonial books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Said took the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images are continuing today .
&quot; on the other hand , our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood remains . &quot;
&quot; I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , faulty Nar@@ r@@ atives domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
this Nar@@ r@@ ative overs@@ ha@@ do@@ ve the reality that nine Muslim women have led their lands during the last three decades while the United States could not even vote their first female presidential candidate .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women shall be prevented , their head@@ scarf in public buildings to cover and aci@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , these are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group is practic@@ ing his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ r@@ atively weak@@ ens Muslim women , which lead movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it is above that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which were brought up with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative has under@@ gone our collective pre@@ conditions such as deep and in@@ correct , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become an@@ tim@@ acy attacks and shi@@ ppers . &quot;
&quot; due to these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
&quot; we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives , who help us understand the world . &quot;
and my industry has failed to have failed to capture Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are afri@@ can @-@ beat Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation that come from 77 countries .

&quot; at that time , when Khan thought the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were un@@ ra@@ ged Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I not a Muslim and American woman now ?
&quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes , or from my hand hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; out of respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I am j@@ est@@ ing , we don &apos;t carry all T@@ ash@@ k@@ or@@ ane with us . &quot;
we must also have no the@@ ological expert to be &quot; a Muslim &quot; or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists , and interactive activists who stri@@ ve to fight far spread across Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the current band of a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islam@@ opho@@ bia with fin@@ ishers , think tanks and experts for the counter@@ feit information that is already a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in more than just a stranger , who breaks the head towel . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was first born when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may be not always visible , but they are here . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbor , my neighbor , my rock in the fire that I am a Muslim when they could look through the 15 @-@ meter concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; it would see all the evening rit@@ ual with my daughter , if I kept it in my arms , and you are called the Arab verses to protect the Koran and the Qur &apos;@@ an . &quot;
&quot; each of them , I repeat three times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I pray that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and evil which one can see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; it is the picture of her that I close my eyes in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their complete and un@@ finished paintings of the old Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and an cor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be virtually complex . &quot;
&quot; Muslim to be a Muslim means to talk the prayers that she had said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslim to be in it , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that has been colon@@ ised for centuries - through a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; - a company founded by the name of the British East India company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .

&quot; affili@@ ation means to rise up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my native grandfather weep . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ az@@ an wept for his family in India , with the family that he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as in my grandfather , were attacked by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have split the Muslim world as at stake risk . &quot;
Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have been colon@@ ized to four Muslim countries .
&quot; it means to know that the first air@@ ship of history was thrown off in a century ago , over a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , asch@@ mir@@ ic sub@@ jection of the British Empire , known as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled into more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , it is deeply returning to our unforgettable family trees . our un@@ founded history . &quot;
&quot; it means that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread over every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , to pursue weapons of mass destruction that are not existing . &quot;
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ kli@@ ker was buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
&quot; an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate in veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy is home to the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story will report four times more than a history with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by an liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country . &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
&quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot;
&quot; an American woman , a Pakistan , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim , a journalist , represents the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple con@@ jun@@ c@@ ous ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion is more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ess , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a mother means to be a mother , to worry about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons are er@@ ect due to structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim stops that began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration official that takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; it is in a country that surro@@ unds its borders across from the countries , which bom@@ bed it . &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &apos; no @-@ fly list &apos; which largely receives Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; they are the wars that we lead , and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories that we tell and because of those who we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the North@@ western university students showed a scientific un@@ true picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 on evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation we must lead
&quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim , or the &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ t@@ ful and dangerous prints that we have been in our news re@@ productions . &quot;
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple with con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ ating ident@@ ities and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the po@@ d@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Al@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ ling ; the po@@ d@@ cast Secret Li@@ ves of America ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ man Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , more Muslim writers , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero , all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global time , in which we are located . &quot;
&quot; and this moment , consequences will go out over the 1.7 billion . &quot;
&quot; there is a reason for that , swe@@ ating the@@ or@@ ist , that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now run the White House . &quot;

&quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the story of which I was not aware of , as I was so old now , as it is my daughter , but those who have made me today at an un@@ disputed Muslim . &quot;

&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of its , consci@@ ously and un@@ aware of the &quot; others &quot; as it was my girlfriend and I did not bom@@ bed a new future while he had no pre@@ sidents , the chocolate cake , while he already cap@@ sul@@ ated countries and &quot; to other people &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story tell story , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license . &quot;
&quot; can you give it a way , here and now , despite a language barrier with someone ? &quot;
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; Global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the In@@ credible blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the language diversity of big cities and appreciate it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the born children . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; mass mortality of the world may be avoided , if we do cities , accept diversity - safe spaces , in which residents do not have to forget who they are . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated to understand &quot; &quot; these events &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; listen to the audience , to appreciate , to link . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller represent their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their de@@ vot@@ ion and their representation will result in this way that the listen@@ ers can be embar@@ ked on it . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou took account the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narr@@ ative of stories . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fork of the rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having explained the importance of his f@@ att@@ ing , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that speaking to an audience that will not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity : &quot;
you have heard them !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and organis@@ ers hope to extend this . all that are inspired by the project can be found in contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own story stories . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to en@@ forcement the state debt

she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church meeting in Puerto Ric@@ os .
&quot; the advoc@@ ate of the re@@ en@@ forcement of debt , also submitted a pet@@ ition to the official White House of the White House of the United States . &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that the politicians , B@@ Ã¤n@@ kers and government agencies that are responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for financial examination and a tap committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions , corresponding to the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ c@@ ting pension@@ ers .
we require immediate measures .
the island - not integrated in the United States state of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on the soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing stat@@ ute . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; the measures imposed on the outside , without the participation and conviction of the citizens are danger to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration wore the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has done for an open net . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : public@@ a held annual conference on digital culture that is held annually in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ ri@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , an academic employee in France , based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara RÃ¼@@ sch@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house that produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , laser extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ struction ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective after@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book which has been published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of the oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it says :
&quot; this book , like movements for free knowledge will be built , and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have a site to view over the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create something in our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and ac@@ claimed Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was kn@@ itted from the A@@ dra @-@ pris@@ ons directory where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information on his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory portion of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushing him to his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bas@@ sel has paid a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temp@@ oral beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police bases laid on the basis of a military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been cont@@ acted by persons on 12 November 2015 and presented themselves as the Insider of the Assad government and they were aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
&quot; its place of residence and condition remain unknown , but remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ le played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge about public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently transfer the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes was more pro@@ spective than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ design the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the junction of numerous civilians and merge Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bas@@ sel didn &apos;t know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything to the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strike in the digital archae@@ ology and the preser@@ vation has created a time cap , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel was unable to exclu@@ de this project yet . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and Bash@@ an taught me to embrace her . &quot;
&quot; I am overwhel@@ med , when I call his name . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was in prison . &quot;
I have learned to read and speak English .
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each , who has asked . he has taught other detention to read and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened me the gate for technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other detention , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without thought it was in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ spective that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she mour@@ ned the lyrics to him , when she visited him , and he translated them out of the Arab into English . &quot;
the book is freely available .

here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens in every visit , &quot;
that I have ver@@ aged in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ;
&quot; at the moment I lose the occupation in the moment , where we embrace us , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers is no matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot;
I forget the prison sentence
&quot; and I , in every detail of your voice , and words , &quot;
&quot; I bear the passion for me , &quot;
when your eyes are well saying
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to get all the moments , &quot;
&quot; and over your absence , to weep and smile . &quot;
I myself testify to myself that I will return soon ...

Bass@@ els &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared for more than 6@@ 5.000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime , were tortured or executed . &quot;
&quot; according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International since 2011 , Am@@ nesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
&quot; today we repeat our demand in hope , which we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
Mos@@ ambi@@ k : due to corruption ab@@ duc@@ ed director to dis@@ appo@@ inting at the previous post
&quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ ence re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is a di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza was between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for a good guide , and immediately requested his re @-@ setting to the company , which was then on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which pro@@ filed an application for Cam@@ b@@ aza , there was no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , as the company was not complete after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants have not been called the action . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution that establishes itself for public transparency , sentenced to the company &apos;s decision in an interview with Deutsche Welle in an interview : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clear the absence of transparency , and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
&quot; what we have to know , is that the company should have to lead a disciplines against the contra@@ dict . &quot;
&quot; however , the company was apparent , however , and does not demonstrate appropriate legal steps for application of appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the ambi@@ ence of social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also and considers the case as &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be advis@@ ors after he was sentenced to death and half of them . &quot;
he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating words he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be integrated into the company which he helped harm . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be paid for his silence . &quot;
resi@@ sted !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young mos@@ quit@@ oes and student of political science in Brazil says the director has no mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State , because he didn &apos;t believe it , I cannot believe that someone was rewarded with such a massive manner . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lack the mor@@ ality to return and serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served themselves on the state instead . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand it is an in@@ exhau@@ stible money source and the state itself is tired of this man , who was invited and eventually condemned to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mozambique can not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , conc@@ ision , and - by next , prophe@@ tic Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous represent@@ ations , when he confirmed energetic that &quot; an ambitious human being in all , also the father@@ land for its amb@@ ition to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know whether a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not change from its amb@@ itions . &quot;
an ambitious human being a criminal one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , reactions were also opposed : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years off and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today it sets the company , in which he is un@@ faithful , return under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Nomin@@ ated Î±@@ d _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored by many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ eric word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or age @-@ up .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took its posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although it is still discussed above the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to humans East Indian origin or generally used as Ad@@ jec@@ tively &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook has addressed the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely ab@@ orted con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word is not automatically calls for Hass@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use , were cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same accounting sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( cam@@ el ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ca@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ nut@@ zer A@@ ung Ka@@ at stated the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , if they knew how he could relie@@ ve his back pain , he made a vocabulary . &quot;
the ku ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ er ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ uns is the opinion that they must be a radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be informed that Facebook has had to spread out all posts , sus@@ pic@@ ion in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you write on fac@@ tual ook .
&quot; instead , what it should be done , the mail is carefully analysed and control him by checking the following words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spi@@ ders ) .
&quot; the good thing is that these three @-@ old nation@@ alists who have received hate language , receive a rather good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the promotion has a strong signal to all send , the hate language might be spreading , the efficiency of this strategy doesn &apos;t stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ orship of percussion often is a cat@@ cher and mouse game , whereby users social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative way of cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to express his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... &quot; when I was attentive to this new gui@@ deline of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my post has been removed from Facebook and I was subject to the li@@ ken , post and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards has not been dismissed . &quot;
Facebook has a wide variety of posts from people who have no negative int@@ entions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate @-@ speaking nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without Hass@@ elt from Facebook is removed .
&quot; in the post , the author distributed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are in the country bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more than ever before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asked questions : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma due to their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
such words will only work even more hate within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; have forbidden . &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not temp@@ t them , fal@@ sely deleted po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit , they would have a huge turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ckery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of Hass@@ elt , to see if their posts will be taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no Hass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch her@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry with a Indian film .
just to try if Facebook contains the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post states , &quot; If you are a doctor , heal human beings ? &quot;
&quot; screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Hass@@ elt should in addition to pre@@ heat the violence in Myanmar in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands of escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure , who would speak blasphem@@ y messages to his bur@@ ial sites under control . &quot;
&quot; instead of just trying the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running to see more in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago at the end of the day@@ time
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to implement a law that is to offer this practice , so the marriage age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es held some members of the Muslim and Muslim communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state , as that , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened subject to the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN children &apos;s just@@ ification , min@@ ors of min@@ ors , every people under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 percent , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago were 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Office of the Land confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ ition@@ ing and social media movements that were stri@@ ving to abol@@ ish laws on child before , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced . undoubtedly , they helped bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; an Hin@@ du leaders , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the child before they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition made for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some sometimes came doubts whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where he would already make a simple majority to the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must vote and declare the law .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of Parliament against the child before was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none .
&quot; after having decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users was thr@@ illed because the laws had been finally changed for children before .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , dedicated to the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken a lot of time and unnecessary Ger@@ ede , which has spar@@ ked the heart of the thing , but do you know what ? the day@@ time is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely enough to take care of the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who heard the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society which openly openly said how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independently of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft on the change of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was announced today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ uties and 35 of them were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were opposed , have voted for the law . &quot;
the child before is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) #
many thanks to all activists who have taken him out .
congratulations .
thank you for our M@@ EPs .
&quot; one possible hook comes in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to under@@ take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise now . &quot;
&quot; during the general public prosecutor , Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite right when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , the most social media user would be desired to put the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we say instead of discussing the discussion so generally speaking in a way that only panic and arro@@ gan@@ ce should be said that the state , our daughters , protects against them , would you be willing to move forward to the debate ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial presence against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child &apos;s legal or remain the norm , even though there are laws that they say . &quot;

both students and fans of TV series fight against the lock .
&quot; although many technologies are used to use converting tools to block websites ( a current article from New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;

&quot; while the platform remains closed , several mirrors ( pages , which are mir@@ ro@@ red the content of Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , which is based on all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) , which is not difficult for the system of domain names and thus making a complete t@@ ens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content is conc@@ ord@@ able , however , in spite of the prohibition . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we have heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we all put everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents in de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ Directory website . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it &apos;s only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the web site . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ knock pe@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ wl around Mir@@ ror pages if every country is blocked by Wikipedia . &quot;
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ll attack a different URL , which is not the original . that what one sees then is by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server conduc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if these are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; this is executed by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad positioning moti@@ fs and washed colours . &quot;
&quot; the motivated him to bear a camera , and try to try the situation . &quot;
back then he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his native village right beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that make attention to Nep@@ als . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , he described this first @-@ class situation at his work : &quot;
&quot; I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game photographers ! ! &quot;
I rested from home when suddenly I called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had a call from my father that would be a leop@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; immediately I ran out with my camera , and was there in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; my father had watched him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leop@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar stre@@ aks a cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , because he already stood by face to face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t inter@@ fere with the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also looking at home because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ ffer appeared . he goes immediately , we &apos;ll see , and he star@@ red through the s@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for promoting Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it took up to seven days for the perfect photo of birds which live near the tourist information . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women will avoid women with greatest care , the name of their husbands or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should be given the norm to life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to the Indian State of O@@ ch@@ a by a pseu@@ dost@@ ems and had promised by her family and the village community , after having addressed a married relatives with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not call her name , is also common among men . however , they have far less access to fear if anything , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health subjects , and house@@ wives , came to a unique club thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for her only to discuss and discuss the host@@ esses of the Patri@@ arch@@ s .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and set up for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her video camera on the re@@ discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s he@@ aders to the ban of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and heads the clubs . &quot;
&quot; it reports about how these clubs are created a safe place for these women , and they were made at the same time to ambassador . &quot;
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion , acted by women who did not call their husbands in their name . &quot;
&quot; she decided on this topic , because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can identify easily . &quot;
&quot; the names of their husbands , not according to pron@@ unci@@ ation , is a spectac@@ le which they have pleaded not guilty and have never questioned any question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life .
&quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t stop this , is regarded as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the tradition is so deep ro@@ oted , that we have never made any thoughts about this discussion . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband , had never had the name to try out at home , as it works . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
about the Roh@@ ini :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started its first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , annoying , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the names of our husbands , but they can call us how they want , means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on the lips , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was out of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ st of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women married the name of their husbands . &quot;
about the Roh@@ ini :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise , there was just st@@ oned away ; another one decided to cast out the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; even in A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ ert about that , with an ancient fire also broke , the women decided that they would really try to call their husbands in their name . &quot;
and they held their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she sat in the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she grab@@ bed her , she was afraid and told that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as Tra@@ gen &apos;s interest in the forehead , indicating the marriage status : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the c@@ ay@@ ber@@ red dot if he would like it . &quot;
he just laughed and I listened to him to carry him .
&quot; the other women did not complete this , but mean , they are now in a better position to choose , even to bear him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; we make a trip at any discussion sk@@ et@@ lu@@ b .
&quot; usually , we have lunch and water , and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives , they sang and sang about things , which they had never done before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on this problem for so many years and yet I have been working on some things , for example like our ident@@ ities to our husbands , never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great , certain things can say no@@ isy , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion case , we have enter@@ tain@@ ed us about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; most of them that is okay , but some wanted to carry a sal@@ ine c@@ ta , a wide shirt of a pants , they have not dreamed . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ versy and discussion about the advantages of its own clothes choice , mor@@ ality linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , decor@@ ate Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan an excursion to Go@@ a where they can carry Je@@ ans , and Roh@@ ini is sure that they can do it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion of discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly entering the roll : &quot;
we have made only little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but stopped again to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some of them included me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the names of their husbands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
&quot; the women in discussion lu@@ b know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ ing of movement , or its own clothes @-@ choice - at the end of a hard to navigate . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how raw is explained :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives us the confidence that something will change .
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman is going home in the club , and other people are told what we are talking about and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on glorious men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , which is the objective of adult purposes for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this resulted in that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government campaigns had developed to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;

&quot; free Bas@@ le : Ne@@ ti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous threat , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions of international community for medical treatment of Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate and dis@@ sident Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has moved attention to international community attention , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state @-@ dangerous ) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demands the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; he told it as &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , China continues to receive views from the international community , Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , release , or to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely out of the topic . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met in late June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu . &quot;
&quot; a speaker , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable Liu in foreign abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was given to Liu , although the Norwegian government had ended nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement in order to be back to China , since the exports since 2010 were mostly blocked . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the news that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to a unconditional release and invited Liu a to withdraw his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was unable to oppos@@ e his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was urged to free Liu and his wife immediately to free the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the European diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , invited China to release Li@@ us as well as in a statement on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we are expecting to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits , which they wish to be able to communicate with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans would like to inform him that he had the possibility for treatment abroad , as long as it is assistance to him . &quot;
&quot; speaking for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , the news agency AFP on 27 June announced that the message released the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu , but also his wife Liu X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US Embassy passed an angry response from China to themselves , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to interv@@ ene and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple following the following :

&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision on the Congress to push the Chinese government to im@@ pose Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany : Germany
&quot; on July 3 , Berlin , the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu explains to all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese president X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could overs@@ ha@@ dow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on June 28 , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called for China to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the possibility to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AFP previously that Li@@ us &apos;s wife , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police still monitors the room in the hospital and that Liu &apos;s not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
&quot; Canada requires China to commit its international human rights issues , including freedom of freedom , to uph@@ old the freedom and responsible for the exercising of this rights . &quot;
France
&quot; in a statement on 29 June , France &apos;s foreign minister urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o is receiving all treatments , which he , regardless where , requires . furthermore , his wife and his family may be contact with him . &quot;
&quot; even though the news broad@@ caster France information already reported that the French government would be welcome to welcome Liu in the country , there was no further information that France will ultimately take up . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the Fest@@ ive issues in Taiwan required China on June 27 , Liu &apos;s release and a larger tolerance to those who require a peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u is also required by the ruling Democratic Party Party in China , also to allow the intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed in a statement on June 28 at Liu very concerned and gave him that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well@@ being . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and had been severely punished to a harmon@@ ious , stable , and prosp@@ erous of China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; personally I felt very moving and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered as a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the International branch of the State of New York , the Minister said that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
it is supported that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody asked me if New York is a democracy ...
&quot; that is , with most people go an error . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; the logic to turn &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable country , you should say that we finally have not been a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons led by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared un@@ refuse . &quot;
&quot; however , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democr@@ atically .
&quot; as soon as you reach the core point of the subject , the good old bodies of the author@@ itative feasi@@ bility is once again to be democr@@ ats , abandoned logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; during the final week , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were given answers to its American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
appropriate questions he clo@@ aked with non @-@ answer r@@ ational style .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his opinion , because they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion . &quot;
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country is our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our advert@@ ised K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clarify this point where he was paid high , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog his comment posted , it points to the reviews that you should start to understand the entire commemorative publication of the conference , so that one might understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city , and no country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ easier for even if we are looking forward to free and interested elections . &quot;
he joined Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously doesn &apos;t mean in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an reveals his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am who makes a leader of a her@@ al@@ ant generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; I am talking about what was said to the Minister of Justice of Singapore , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which is expecting me - may I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes , right and what he is defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review defines the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos; committed an error &apos; or was it a fri@@ g@@ er speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is no country , we are only considered independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role in the government &apos;s government , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am plays on serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singap@@ ore@@ dom afford their military service , they defend their city only their own country ? &quot;
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the affir@@ mation , Singapore is , and always was a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have many Singapur of Singapur ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite right . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about his editors : what is the most Miss@@ ed aspect on your residence or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuing series with rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world uncovered and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is asked me most in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ?
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 , I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation takes place the conversation , it is considered polite to show interest in his talk partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; at my clari@@ fication then follows the standard reply : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans do perhaps cooking in front of anger , if they are kept for Americans , but I do not distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little , which distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian banner clearly visible on their back@@ pack , when they are travelling . &quot;
all dear Canadian .
on the other hand ...
&quot; so it was , when I began 20 years ago , when I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little monkey leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay couples have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think of Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as well as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I ad@@ mi@@ red very much . &quot;
&quot; it would be nothing that would change me , for example , to change Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , as &quot; nice , &quot; means &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be sk@@ e@@ able - as the good @-@ tired , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian double devils ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the actual problem exists in it that &quot; nice &quot; doesn &apos;t have personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; be harmless , means in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this may be something good when you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ n@@ b of things that pass around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the wish , free , and to be alone , is a key of Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters .
&quot; as a &quot; nice &quot; out@@ ward , maybe just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence with neighbours .
&quot; we are missing the warm heart@@ ed , open kindness , which I connect with my American friends . &quot;
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has almost made her almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has published a music video which took power in 2014 and restore the power in 2014 despite its promises to restore the civil government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told it to his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the sustained military regime of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook alone was 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Lik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; dict@@ ator was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists put the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta domin@@ ation . &quot;
take a look at the videos of the videos that relate to some of the political issues surrounding Thailand in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which makes the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; creation change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians , and other people who are considered a critic . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules often are used by the authorities to negoti@@ ate activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was set up , having supervised the online content and persons who was accused of having the monarchy to have been prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand is a strict conclusion against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic mar@@ gins ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , a war law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the Army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to buy , is their decision to buy expensive subway boats , although security experts they war@@ n that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax fraud . &quot;
&quot; in the video , even as people will be thrown into a black v@@ ans before you bring it into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly created &quot; confusion &quot; in society and using Internet users , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the band members of the band members , which had already been used by P@@ utsch against &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by P@@ utsch against the protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in Eastern Europe , especially in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al shows striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ v@@ ava are located in the carbon basins of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shi@@ pers , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today we live in the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases in the area .
such settlements are also called vul@@ tures cities in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people still lived here , only a few hundred people in these vul@@ tures were still alive . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of 16,000 people amounted to 16,000 people after having barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; this is a consequence of the war , &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey detached house of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ ko@@ w@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls to him hard to end this .
&quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all the community served . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ endor of spl@@ endor .
the people who once lived on this place and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ow@@ kas , which is still one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they detect me with the camera in the hand , they go back immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother is forbidden to let us take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers of her friend something and suddenly leaving them destroyed the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the laps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left her to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to receive no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she has supported her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a house neither a vegetable garden , it is very difficult to survive &quot; , &quot; she gives . &quot;

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts immigrants on its long journey
&quot; Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula he is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
&quot; it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Br@@ ass frame and golden @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for around $ 2.@@ 50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us to get people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; mom Africa ! &quot; &quot;
where are you M@@ om Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
she would not refuse to reject .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are ill , they buy them medications which they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that are exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yoghurt sample ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston . &quot;
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel it fits to her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other signs from Mama Africa . &quot; mother Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kaner can often travel to the route and that , the Afri@@ cans already speak on What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of its way@@ men , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the Bust@@ ick@@ et to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will be contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; mom Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; &quot; he answered sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they went away to report them about their journey or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a s@@ ack@@ g@@ asse to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela is running . &quot;
&quot; during this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family had taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is Poli@@ z@@ ist and has established that Bust@@ ers may be sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests can do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .

China : X@@ in@@ jiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones .
&quot; a check @-@ Point for personal communication equipment in X@@ in@@ tra of Twitter users in X@@ in@@ ang on the top of the square , &quot;
&quot; the residents of X@@ in@@ jiang , a ethnic min@@ orities region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell notification , where it aims to install the district government , a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in communication , it is said that the app is to hin@@ der access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities will also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had already installed the app messages with a private chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the Not@@ ification of the police that the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ age of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , of online fraud , Trojan and Ph@@ ishing sites to make users attentive as much time they spend online , and to control your own home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors shall help the children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these features can be used in various ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; remote control , or even h@@ ack@@ ers able to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often no@@ zzle for those who live in distant , urgent ethnic minority regions such as X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme interest and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ iss@@ ile internet connections . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; , &quot; published photos from a chec@@ kl@@ ist , displayed photos of a chec@@ kl@@ ist , at which polic@@ emen had checked the residents in@@ discri@@ min@@ ately , whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ in@@ ian ensures that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that the app will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are using a check@@ point using a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people , to use . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( Germany ) published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and get un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ in@@ jiang will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize the prevalence of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication equipment . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned this new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ jiang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree to all residents and entrepreneurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable disks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy terrorist videos , however , the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible failure rates , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or Death ; part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in a series of &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane tells his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and set firmly that you are alone at a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has changed after and after dissolved , and revealed a truth , which is clearly recognis@@ able , both inside and from the outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all the glory .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you pick the reality back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the perform@@ ers - transform the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt det@@ ach themselves in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is caught on the axis of the ung@@ od@@ ation . you will clear that you are here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father &apos;s three times , but that was not enough for me to form@@ ulate &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the head of the Security Service would form@@ ulate it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he posed his power over us , by doing even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew . &quot;
five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to destroy the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all urban districts sought , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , un@@ condition@@ ally , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which until the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply to work in the neighborhood . &quot;
I went through the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to get together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends shut me ; we brought us into a splendid picture that filled my expectations and fulfilled all . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you realize that you delivered the Spirit from the lamp , but it is simply interested in the barley . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you send it all the way to the office of security services from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you cry &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are just brave enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot;
his eyes filled his eyes on me .
&quot; and you dream of what , look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot;
I was 18 years old . it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
&quot; perhaps it was on my fool@@ is@@ hness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure , when I replied , &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped to look in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation , which could have such a fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father , with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , right with it . &quot;
the cont@@ ention of this cursed sat@@ in lies in the nose until today .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was exposed to months . &quot;
I pass through the yard .
&quot; in the first office I leave everything back , which I bear with me . &quot;
&quot; then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells . &quot;
I prepared all the details exactly before I care the room .
otherwise they have assigned a bigger cell again this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and may sit down immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I went on an old proven communication method : with the fist to beat the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; sin@@ cer@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after long hes@@ it@@ ating , he finally answered me . &quot;
apparently there was none of the surrounding cells in any of the surrounding cells known to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , there are no prominent face of facial expressions , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers have a existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the great cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would be happy when I stay . &quot;
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row , to drive all these cro@@ ws , which l@@ ain about the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always about this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black the color of the destro@@ yer is , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror into person , The Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; playing on 13 S@@ ure of Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be li@@ stens to .
&quot; this was the secret to protect us and prevent the security of us to protect and prevent the terrorists in us , so they played their con@@ essi@@ onal dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ essi@@ on@@ table exploration card and made the tight view@@ point of their world view . &quot;
&quot; here is not a house , which is no country ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ enz to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I supervised the hearing room and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions , the expression of him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join this T@@ age@@ di@@ eben and to protest at demonstrations , which will soon become an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I used to acc@@ ust@@ omed it to answer .
&quot; I can really say more precisely , when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me become an ordinary communication tool . &quot;
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to acc@@ ust@@ omed me or bad to be punished , although I had done nothing to make this penalty . &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
&quot; its command is to pl@@ uck me as much flesh as possible from the body . &quot;
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession &quot; .
it begins with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your h@@ ugs takes care of your cry .
&quot; give it a pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot keep your cry . &quot;
&quot; my terr@@ ors don &apos;t get enough , why they re@@ plac@@ ated the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector , or if it belonged to normal working facilities . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in each other , to present us out of their sight , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the series . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any sense in my body , and my voice , why I heard it cry out . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ker noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why it is the next to an electric loaded rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity through all the body , enough to supply my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power manager . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty to this night . &quot;
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to lie down again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , that came to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fil@@ s the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I reply with the voice of a exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fear@@ ful concerns . &quot;
&quot; be silent and get away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smoke a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the picture was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib brings the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he s@@ ut@@ ters his screen to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; what you can rely on , there is a cig@@ ar between his fingers , or with nic@@ ot@@ ine spots to discover . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the chief of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as a fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ ib is a passionate activist , which has been transferred to the conservative majority of Yugoslavia , sexu@@ ality and free expression of opinion through art and rap@@ es@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; but with his music that is often consp@@ ic@@ uous with topics like Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian milit@@ ants , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find in the city &apos;s hom@@ etown , but also in cities that from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib sees itself as someone who is not restricted to its mind , and he can participate in his mind , with the most devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he doesn &apos;t turn it open , he swe@@ eps on the US foreign policy for a special issue . &quot;
H@@ da@@ ib considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib believes not that his compassion for those who try to do in war zones , that he was born in Jordan , even if he was born in Jordan , and yet never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circumstances so , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ da@@ ib . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a person , &quot; while in the water , Nes@@ ad@@ an . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten to sunset from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do against Islam . &quot;
basically the sn@@ aps speak warm coffee and the scar@@ ves of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you throw a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it avo@@ ids basic things to do - as in the public while the Ram@@ ad@@ an is drinking water - to land not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jord@@ an@@ ians had cancelled a show of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila to the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual Fron@@ ti@@ Ã¤n@@ gers contradic@@ ts Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former press conference of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , that the concert &quot; just had to be cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous acti@@ vism , which represents the alt@@ itudes &apos; legitim@@ acy regime in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to take up &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to be a kind of rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually an evident @-@ cryst@@ alline reality contradic@@ tory in Jordan , clearly reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs factory . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib was a traditional gender nor@@ ms to body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ wed sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a evi@@ d@@ folded woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them , which they should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ mor@@ ant &apos; - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ our in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law of Crime control from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner violence , &quot; and for their release is often a year @-@ long bureaucr@@ atic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to rep@@ el the topics covered in his country for a long time .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib stri@@ ves to deny that his work is politically , however , that he is not able to separate his music that is full of explic@@ it anom@@ ali@@ es on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , a man . &quot;
&quot; politics was in@@ timi@@ dated for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ ib takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus will turn on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically politically , can continue . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the songs , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get what you want &quot; - be faith or belief , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he not@@ ices that , in Jordan , he is talking about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were torn from context , twi@@ sted and had been cen@@ sored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a working version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ ib is open to the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als did not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet of the eighth century , which still remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ er@@ otic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib wonders : if Abu Nu@@ oro , who would like to work in the order of the Cali@@ ph in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians not do that ? &quot;
&quot; the actual problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the Sem@@ itic Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government &apos;s attacks on freedom of expression was sanc@@ tion@@ ed and that progressive votes will be put to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service ordered several former government officials and members of the teaching staff , with the reas@@ oning , they had expressed himself on comments on comments in social media that were related to corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , according to only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him progress , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila arrived for him for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it looks like H@@ da@@ ib - consists of slow , thought and internal changes . he is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ ib dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from a Arab world without intervention . &quot;
&quot; he did not only dream about his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is managed by music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not led by bombs , spreading , and on arti@@ f@@ ical ways . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time is done , H@@ da@@ ib is continuing to pass , according to that resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was presented by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man has been referred to as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this large , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory states that the rein@@ forces , the drums and dancing over a thousand years have been invaded , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force Em@@ ishi into the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
&quot; you can only imagine how large these parts are ... &quot;
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two p@@ ush@@ ers are straight to see .
&quot; nonetheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival , the only tru@@ e - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ a@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a height of 18 metres was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of summer !

&quot; rare were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history , because they are helping to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession as the hair@@ dressing . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug dealers are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers who can re@@ produce these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity even has an annual event inspired by the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts to join each other in order to show who of them can create the ec@@ cent@@ ered L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; education institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to share young people with their weapons against hair@@ dresser tools and instead of bad advice a training in hair @-@ art , which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and throughout the possibilities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; the school offered special training workshops in front of the school year , and reported about some of its successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this education community . &quot;

why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel guilty , oppos@@ ing aff@@ ection ? &quot;
this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) who encour@@ ages young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa &apos;s letters .
&quot; only recently , her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the Gu@@ err@@ illa Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colombia ) , which forms the battle point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the sig@@ nat@@ ory of Peace President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its of peace .
&quot; before Colombia is still a long way , until one can speak of an effective reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ers who lived for many years in illegal camps , subjected to war rh@@ et@@ oric and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed itself to life in constant anxiety and in some cases deep hatred toward gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now hold them into their ranks and support them in the building of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and exactly that they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in the company .
the campaign &apos;s goal is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - that will then be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as a inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; this declared that we love those people who love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those who need to have much unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told further to share his love with people that needed this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now can find their place in society and a new life is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2,000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I would never thought that someone would be forgiven
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ ape to transfer the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC on how they had done before , to oppos@@ e the commands of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters full of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear up to happiness and everything that lies between &quot; &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we had given the letters , a former fighter made me by the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because in addition to him there was a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the thorn . &quot;
&quot; and I asked him , saying , &quot; H@@ ello , what do they do ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life , someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; then , I suddenly answered the tears about the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I embra@@ ced him , and sat down beside the pomegran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggle , and would help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of hunger . &quot; I have never thought that someone would be forgiven for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society outside there is waiting for us .
&quot; until now , I have learned only how I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC came together in a discussion group . &quot;
the students were all up and grew up as a war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced , as we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country more righteous . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never found heard and no election law , and to know that the people who were often seen as monster , and even hate people who were shot through their lifestyle and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; reality , in which the country lives , hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and so much harm to us , and give us a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote as Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
Colombia was made evidence that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would rule .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to rise up and to protest against their rights . and that &apos;s also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; from the F@@ ARC now we rely on peace , a policy without arms . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all def@@ ender of peace - no matter which breed , religion or ide@@ ology they hear them - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victim , because we know of our own experience that nothing is easy . among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but in common we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Caucas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , body and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; with dre@@ ad , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , such as a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth about the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not just over night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who has dealt with us some of her experiences and talked with us about what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines in several months after reports , which were published reports , torture and torture , que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities that susp@@ ect susp@@ icious men and they were in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was growing , she became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was no safe place for her , which was why it moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of Che@@ chens from the gender equality of her country wife , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; for fear of her life , she attracted the last end@@ ition to the USA . &quot;
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer helper for human rights organization .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone thought of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men to eliminate these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos taken from my documents through the What@@ s@@ App round . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing so , some shopping fans came up from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honour the family yet ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up the final end of the hospital .
apparently some women had given everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two young@@ sters in my right lung wings . &quot;
OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid - in men &apos;s men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got the threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , and wrote me - Rel@@ ated , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ time .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; the desired to send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , to prove that all that was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they created absurd demands : some told me , I let it prove that I had not changed through the streets and I say that I had not changed my sex in the official television that everything was only bad speaking , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have bas@@ eline size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic is disappointed . &quot;
&quot; we can not touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she was wearing a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window and a license plate with a 95 .
&quot; after the third time , it was clear to me that there was a little la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number of human rights - it turned out to be persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to share their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief . &quot;
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
&quot; just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without register , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you war@@ n in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
you know in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ ert . you even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality . however , this is a table theme . &quot;
&quot; some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements , I still bear in myself . &quot;
&quot; as much as I wish it , this sec@@ ular barrier can &apos;t overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I am really trying to look like the person , to which she remembers them from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed ? &quot;
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for whom I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I talked with someone who received a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an no people were arrested and tortured , but also , that all the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; that , as I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they will take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end , a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has learned through blood . &quot;
OC Media : are you still arrested even gay men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it wasn &apos;t too many .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relations , or those of their relatives have been left to place the Kad@@ y@@ row court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there to present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they had been attacked in any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but systematically sub@@ merged to radic@@ alise . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a assumption or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard had grown . &quot;
&quot; since then , there was nothing new of them . &quot;
they just took them .
&quot; and so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved as these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; however , until now they were not presented as band@@ its , in addition there were no reports yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why should I not allow this people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ ut@@ ations and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who were invited to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already took place in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I believe that before 2003 I was already familiar with a lot , when I was still living there - and I had never encountered problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia initially wanted to bring us to the &quot; civilian &quot; , &quot; but ultimately put us back in the st@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were p@@ umped ; I had dy@@ ed eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of the Sch@@ aria has never sha@@ ken me a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and all the city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means &quot; Sp@@ otte not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; it often says to children , when they are making fun . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes from you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never have insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted , and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did these gifts work ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he started talking about mor@@ als on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t talk about us , but above the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless - one could sense , as the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who had vo@@ wed and laughed before , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic increased steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity will you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ iter .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
&quot; besides , I am still active as activist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I come uni@@ denti@@ fied with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , coll@@ ars , I gi@@ fted them to the hospital and help them to get eating cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t leave a cent .
I discovered this man himself when I ab@@ lu@@ te the vari@@ etal vari@@ etal .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ working .
&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ ch@@ ens , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no oscill@@ ation with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ an have who , the Kab@@ ar@@ din@@ er , have those who have Russians also ; on the whole planet it is - but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims going into the mosque and while the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
&quot; do you know , many think about transp@@ sid@@ y of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tur@@ key . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry I am here so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I don &apos;t know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ nings within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase of self @-@ moral . &quot;

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he em@@ itted for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness who want to come up and remain anonymous to his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on the YouTube video , a video kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself . &quot;
&quot; some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ tal hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to the local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists warned against that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ w Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hung . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a matter in common : they were all family fathers , who felt themselves with persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and in@@ capable , to feed their families and to pursue a secure work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community based in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to contest its native Arab population . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and in 1925 , under@@ taking great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields , as well as some of the richest and most valuable agricultural areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , regional economy continues to grow slowly , and the indigenous population receives only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and dis@@ bur@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ ians systematically work@@ places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are lying . &quot;
&quot; this dem@@ i only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as fishing and palm @-@ trees industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate under the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian youth rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian CEO for cooperation , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ mad Az@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , completed 55 % of secondary school and completed 45 % a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ Tim@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; as Fun@@ ctions and Institu@@ tions do not pre@@ fers Arab labour , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to working possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; that is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to make them to make their living down outside of their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their fore@@ front and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the speech of the Arabic language or the Tra@@ gen Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances given that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must bear , propose human rights activists , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
&quot; it remains to wait , if the world is w@@ aking up and knowledge . &quot;
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ic@@ ide@@ able is avo@@ id@@ able .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can be read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react , especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
you wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even thought well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , that women today still earn less money , despite the same education . &quot;
&quot; however , women are still under strict observation , when it comes to do what they are doing with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards are still responsible for women , sooner or later in various areas of life to a gl@@ itter@@ ing blanket , and that discrimination based on the sex is still across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is conscious and known to me .
I am convinced and I am double and triple them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to talk on skin color , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I agree on what kind we have been physically active , se@@ al@@ ic and verb@@ al ab@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , made many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
but still all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing &quot; their voices and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexual violence , there is an institutional form of motiv@@ ating violence , which we suspended black women on two times . &quot;
&quot; or above , black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and women are less likely to earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black sp@@ ouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I want to consider all men , all men and all men , neither any skin color any other rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider as a black woman , in whose center the white woman is to take into consideration un@@ just@@ ly , un@@ just@@ ices in their thinking , as well as to the skin color one person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and I won &apos;t fight for my belonging , in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sp@@ ies that always has always rejected me and countless other black women and again . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner was be@@ ating in 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and even I refuse to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a deser@@ ted and mar@@ g@@ inal essence . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to advance their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will not try to try white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different approaches , and ren@@ dering the white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of myself full of femin@@ ism and to join me from femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of being a white femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so stub@@ born than a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we will define black women according to our own ideas and go into the Sp@@ h@@ ubs , which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they can be able to defend ourselves and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed to make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after having read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift the black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and due to my being as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life neither out@@ dated , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; in the past 7 years , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special issue through the region of Iraq in Iraq . its mission aims to consci@@ ously improve the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a that explains us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community . &quot;
&quot; I definitely wanted to do something for the river we had lost than I was a child , &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dust extra@@ cting , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ fall Alliance - which works in it and works to protect the rivers , streams and water routes in Iraq as well as the local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the hon@@ esty and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we wouldn &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia von Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq and multimedia journalist , filmed and published . &quot;
&quot; the emphasis on their work is followed , some considerable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video photography and new multimedia techniques that can tell their stories to their stories . &quot;

the following article is the shortened and processed version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ine Women ) that reports about violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , a police commander , said that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time has passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena , due to abuse , profit also benef@@ ited from A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife moved back their ad . &quot;
&quot; to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women , it is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if women are re@@ im@@ ited at all , they will not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men that they mis@@ use . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit to be victims of violence at all of the prosecution . &quot;
&quot; holding 1 pun@@ ches and statistical analysis , 2 un@@ seen fail@@ ures and a legal system that has nothing subject @-@ imm@@ t@@ 3 of the laws : good approach , def@@ icient realization and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really are abuse , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Document@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that show not even the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; the figures available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Court of At@@ tor@@ ney passed 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . at 70 % of it , violence against women went on . &quot;
86 % of advertis@@ ements came by the police .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace dishes . here , 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
this statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di only few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on any woman who are ref@@ unded in Paraguay due to psychological abuse . come 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this will be ref@@ unded to every woman who do not do this , &quot; &quot; said the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a separate crime , the prosecution authorities cannot document appropri@@ ately , how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
&quot; the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violence . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mariana Hard@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera it was insi@@ sted that she called his name all of her former friends .
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but nevertheless , however , this should always regret it . &quot;
&quot; today , Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but two years she carried the psych@@ ic violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier this , I thought that only women had happened to sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he was isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever had the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long from Carlos , and left him not before . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost the way , when they wanted to say that victims of abuse are at least a certain complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , which does not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner they bl@@ ended . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all involved in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
&quot; in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; after all , their wealthy partners eventually managed to convince them that they were worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities stayed without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a trial against their former partner who developed into an in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous jur@@ ist struggle between Paraguay and their home country , where it was mainly around money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; law laws : good approach , def@@ icient implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resi@@ du@@ es and a struggle against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ter ( # Princip@@ al ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ ft@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ in@@ less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law looks forward to declare Fem@@ ale d to an independent perpet@@ ual crime , as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; so the legisl@@ ature was changed in some points to win the MPs for the Law , that feared the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was provided , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process costs that have to bear the victims of violence even if they just want to receive a safe accommodation , place the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri , argu@@ ed that the law is not effective when the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , failure is seen as part of human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , that violence is no longer regarded as a little ones . &quot;
&quot; who , in view of these facts , is guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will be stra@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; we must refund so long , until failure is no longer than normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage is kn@@ itting , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions on the changes are going apart .
&quot; the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor , once again to attack his victims . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political power &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;
this article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ine Women ) that reports about violence against women in Paraguay .

independent Media in Oman a year after ban of a newspaper continued assault
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Information Minister , &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s official newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed an independent Arabic language Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were arrested and tried again and returned to trial . &quot;
&quot; Oman has re@@ igns in the power of Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power since 1970 , after he had put his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , due to a coup . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only s@@ ult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the s@@ ult@@ ans of the Sultan is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic violence , including freedom of civil liberties , including freedom of freedom , including freedom of civil liberties , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; the authorities susp@@ ect peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists in mind to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , as well as offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention three of her editors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported in Oman by corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until they had been banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces called Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , who was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , with the title &quot; High @-@ level parties &quot; hands of justice &quot; . &quot; in this case , corruption was in judicial decisions in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise the judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the paper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bound hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board Committee , was invited to the ISS before the special department , and was arrested at his arrival of security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took Deputy Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who served as Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at in@@ definite age , after the information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms , and ordered the final closure of the newspaper . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both were condemned among others because of the disorder of the public order &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ excav@@ ation of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found out of the violation of an audience and a sl@@ ander for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison pen@@ alties and fin@@ es of pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) and was subsequently rep@@ lic@@ ated by the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after completing the use of an information networks on the spread of material that could represent a danger for public order .
&quot; on 22 August 2016 , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released in prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appeals Court said Al @-@ Abr@@ i on a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in jail for his six @-@ month sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his prison sentence .
&quot; in addition , the Court of Appeal adopted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself exposed to attacks by the Japanese government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Information Minister sent a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , giving the minister again a further appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeals to allow the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which in Oman at the youngest time the press was injured . &quot;
&quot; for further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ in and the exercising of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , will present their operations . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to freedom of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) urges the following authorities on : &quot;
1 . to release You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . protect the Press Freedom in the Land and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights violations and journalists in Oman ordered their right @-@ to @-@ right human rights and without fear of failure , including judicial kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit organization and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights of human rights ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf area and in neighbouring countries to gather peace@@ fully , supported and protecting them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is carried out with his introduc@@ tions &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . this is an increasing area which addresses one of the most urgent requirements of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need on @-@ site medical research , there are two reasons : for one missing in the offer of global health , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; illnesses such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have widespread effects as elsewhere , and lack of investments for exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which will be carried out by African scientists themselves , with its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be convey@@ ed for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for the Study of Inf@@ ection Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first engraved effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied himself at the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
g@@ v : what are your opinion about important scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differenti@@ ate from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only rely solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always keep the receiver , instead of being M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often not good used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught to improve the situation .
&quot; g@@ v : how large is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
&quot; there are needs of special scientific training , starting in every age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
g@@ v : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the resulting access to scientific expertise that pose here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India , such as &quot; Open Source &quot; plant producers change global food production &quot;
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which offers solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on breed let@@ tu@@ ce into the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company provides 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been made only by its own int@@ ru@@ pul@@ sion and the question how many salads of salads can get borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more salads were patented , and that he could not continue to be used for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents have not only used for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ or or green or cr@@ isp@@ y leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more such patents have been filed for ever more plants such as cereals or cart@@ on sites . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security to ensure the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on still breed let@@ tu@@ ce , but he needs to do so much longer because his work is always more effective . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if a rock bro@@ wn@@ stone would lie in a river , in order to get up . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents have to go too far away . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of perf@@ umes , because all the features are patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible , trying to breed those characteristics which he would like . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is always bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have been bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ ate of the variety Out@@ red@@ dish in the greenhouse gas station and eaten . there will be tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds like this , as it would come from the IT @-@ area and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software for alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; it was called to life in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property , and so suitable for plant bre@@ eders permanently . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , briefly called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders can also under@@ take care of them that others are able to freely use them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they can &apos;t continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breed their seed , and not immediately out - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
dark outlook
&quot; Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security as well as for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , a role in greater interaction such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to stick the latter not or only little by using them seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not employed with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , we need control over the plant in global agricultural industry , which , for example , should also be able to buy food locally locally and sustain@@ ably producing vegetables , as it should be cultivated on farms in the global agricultural industry , as well as to know how this vegetable is bred . &quot;
&quot; food @-@ confident , without seed @-@ confident , is not possible . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available Gen@@ pool is due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always limited , shr@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , a Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has been engaged in her doctoral variation with genetic variation of carrots and their availability . it found out that about one third of all box features are protected as intellectual property , which is either un@@ suitable for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates are not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ en@@ sely inn@@ ed plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots . &quot;
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants are bred so far that they have targeted features - from such as improves their flavor or their color up to such as they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is growing through increasingly more patents . but genetic diversity is currently unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse prior to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ ader Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to realize that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company establishes the company for the preser@@ ving of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not contradic@@ ts that intellectual property of other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan to follow everyone once the patent expired . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection is not in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but promotes them by being able to provide more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees the different way : 20 years for waiting , until a patent strap , certainly don &apos;t support innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for so long , to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one should have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general well and should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aries are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; this is what we do , and it is impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on inter@@ fere with the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics itself . &quot;
&quot; the plants are formed by themselves , as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how plants do that . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breed a variety , also breed its own values in them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in the industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , which are required for the cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides , bre@@ eders in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exact . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it will create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject it or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile , or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeding Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders in avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ rons , would be : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than the company that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years self @-@ competition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent one is really easy for 20 years before the competition . &quot; &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance &quot;
&quot; indeed , the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; cat@@ tery ; the concept itself spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the center for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . for obtain@@ ing the seed crops , the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties . &quot;
it also supports her to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell her own .
the German Organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open @-@ source license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from land to land , absent due to O@@ ss@@ i obligation not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in early November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventi@@ onally far@@ med plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is not yet no law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement these new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; plant movement and worldwide trend towards the orientation of seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the open source &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; program for Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , is responsible for the scheduled next year of the official starting signal . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C ) and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , a Verb@@ und of Aid organizations like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , including Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers may have to share , share , and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report also the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphas@@ ises - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i , hopes that soon more people will be seen . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has been considered , where and how some is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still locking content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5th , the Egyptian government documented the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step in sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the first Network for Human Rights Information Rem@@ ains - despite this attack and the stat@@ ute of the Egyptian right and the Constitution to defend a voice in this part of the world , it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was not so difficult to overcome these targets to overcome the blocking , and do not admit that we continue to fulfill our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 pages before more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of the Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , in addition to the blog of the column and human rights activist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ es and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , whom he set up to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which Zi@@ pp@@ blog is home , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; in December 2013 , Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , while he was arrested by the student protests in December 2013 , while he studied physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article is mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada responded to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the Blogs to unlock is very old , but has not priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the lock is not important for the world , it is , however , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to con@@ vey the feeling of a siege to me ; an arrest , a temp@@ oral murder , pre@@ load at the national Security Council , the lock blogs , as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to handle c@@ ens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the Mu@@ ch go the way to an end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06 . August 133 websites . this was technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , through the conversion of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE told in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we realized how the locking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter content , which might have access to Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation will be made in addition to the fact that the ens@@ ur@@ istic decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using them before the court . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day for day , newspapers in all Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in country and country of numerous postcard designs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be rough pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , marine and air @-@ air to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and the financial situation in 2017 , the Rio de Rio has reached the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
&quot; reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 , at least the manager of a local newspaper . &quot;
&quot; for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; published on 16 August , published a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the paper :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crime that will happen in any big city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that is happening by the civili@@ zed standard , and what is happening in Rio , will be called the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we do not exclu@@ de journalists in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video which was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure is : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war@@ fare in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper declared that there are according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories , which are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the Editorial the newspaper continues :
&quot; we consci@@ ously aware that a war@@ fare rate , if it is dist@@ orted , also can be used to disgu@@ ise abomin@@ ations of the police , which is only shooting and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; get more than they benefit ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , however , argu@@ ed that violence as &quot; war . &quot; this was in their opinion a just@@ ification of failed security policy through the media and could make it harder to draw the responsibility for the police . &quot;
this is no war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ adequate investment in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ fake compar@@ ative service of public service . &quot;
remember@@ ing : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities are in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we watch the murders per state , Rio is at No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; an extra belongs to the Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly been repe@@ ating security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; one of the safety policy measures also included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police station and station@@ ed a unit permanently . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . but for some years , the U@@ PP had to protect the poor and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor churches which should be protected as a police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010 where he explains why violence in Rio would not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for human beings . &quot;
&quot; because this calls for the state , means of funds and ways , which are typical for a war . to this , a civilian point in the landscape is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape is and an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; one week now , it is now that the police captured the hill with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to raise the death of a police . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , this incident has also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shame that fired the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syrians to plant mushrooms
screenshot of the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blocking , mainly by the Assad regime compared to loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a common initiative of the Nobel Peace Institute PA@@ X and the Research Institute of Syria , are located in Damascus and surrounding , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b , at present about one million Syrians in a state of the siege . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack on chemical weapons resulted in hundreds of civilians with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on the basis of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these have stood by rebels controlled areas outside Damascus under siege , which led the inhabitants on local or by tunnel and control points for@@ ged foods . &quot;
&quot; through the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional food products have become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i are not part of conventional food in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many people of the besie@@ ged east G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the right of the project , plan Nabil , said opposite the French news agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivation the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been w@@ rest@@ led for three years to announce this project and pressed his relief , that it is now more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to con@@ vey 125 families knowledge to plant vineyards , Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of the expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel short@@ age , locally produced fuel imports are used locally to supply the generators with the necessary power . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of fung@@ us seeds , &quot; before they checked up their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project , and after further 3 months , they have spread mushrooms anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eila stated that it is part of a bigger movement .
&quot; we want people to contribute the fung@@ al for various reasons &quot; : breaking of the siege .
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self catering , by eating re@@ lics ( such as paper , tea , coffee house , cardboard , etc ) are used for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work home . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs for people with disabilities , bound to their home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea in all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to help people in crisis areas and we can help mankind .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
&quot; on 21 October , several hundred people prot@@ ested to many district capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that invaded the north of Portugal in the week . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of October 15th and 16th , so that the government proclaimed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state . &quot;
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks breaks , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European Forest Monitoring System , which supervised the forest areas by satellite photos , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
that you can make a better picture of the serious situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ ians ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread in the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the field :
the sigh@@ ted tragedy
the aim of protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to conv@@ ene the extent of tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
they did this Sunday : there are dozens of places of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could happen again , as the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits will be observed in Ã@@ r@@ t@@ ances with a high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a wide proposal on the forest form , which the government had brought to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was assigned by the municipalities which saw the new rules as obst@@ acle for investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the part of the case , if the applicant had been built over funds for self @-@ protection - that was a open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article by the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made sure that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a v@@ icious circle , according to the fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; these issues are added to these problems that the website of the Civil Protection Act of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , sought to review information or tried to contact relatives . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real @-@ time about the location and the spread of fires .
&quot; the project was created in 2015 by the developer of JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade , and was so crucial for this f@@ ate@@ ful weekend in October so that the server followed the attack of the 400,000 users who pursued the fires , not counted : here the website counted more than half a million . &quot;

&quot; during a night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , joined the Province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t tell it back then , she didn &apos;t know that she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ bs .

&quot; Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat leader was assassin@@ ated by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt protection . &quot;
the Taliban were getting closer to their hatred to the Haz@@ ara .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af took place in Pakistan . &quot;
a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ itation . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took the thing that was left of his low wages , and went in Iran . once again he was in a strange land along with other refugees and to@@ wed sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than he himself to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran were min@@ ted by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no facilities there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so we do not refres@@ h at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af brought his life without papers in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ el@@ essly , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that par@@ ted twice a day food in the needy . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special centers &quot; . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a admission centre , if they have officially asked a request for asylum - which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then there are people who have no money to stay , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it went A@@ shar@@ af .
but his infinite lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after he had made various works in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af burned his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel and opened a snap@@ shot .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now on the topic of documentary &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the first time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans started companies , including cutting eries , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the cellars and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu &apos;s menu tells of the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims far beyond the Italian food industry and retail trade , and aim to go back to the country that he had to leave un@@ gener@@ alized as teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , even possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my land , and I can &apos;t live happy when I know that my people suffer . &quot;
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country especially for women .
they represent the half of society and have to get the same options as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also decor@@ ate plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their appointment on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill of bill , which sees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users have to use themselves to use social networks within six months , following the most successful legislative decree on the website of the authority , as well as their reference number . &quot;
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months imprisonment or the end of a penalty payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently negoti@@ ating the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and will be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another Chamber of Dep@@ uties gave a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tou@@ g@@ her pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian right , the President of the President as well as state institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law of the law , a such deed would be ge@@ aring up with prison and fin@@ es , so right @-@ right of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would have been a political climate with which the right to freedom of expression and meeting freedom has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; an distinctive example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud plan Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while fighting violence against protest@@ ers who led the military coup against the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison administration failed to recall the accused of prison in the court room . &quot;
&quot; sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do@@ ers , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza gave the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who also were arrested at the previous incident , 25 years ago . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists to pier@@ ced documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been heard mainly on a for@@ get@@ ed action plan . the President of the Republic , which is explicitly backed a controversial legislative bill , to ensure the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April at the Na@@ wa@@ at website , raises a light on how the prepar@@ atory plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature look like . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Conference , Ben G@@ har@@ bia dismissed the right to protect its sources under Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Conference . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the District Court in Tunis on May 09 , he entered the case as a witness . &quot;
will China force social media to avoid their identification ?
&quot; according to new rules of the information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users social media in China require permission to write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the provisions , it is stated that the registration will be required with the full recur@@ rent name . &quot;
analysts believe that this should be reached by the Eli@@ mination of anonymous comments in entertainment within social networks . it &apos;s until now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese network citizens proposed in the social media to address these regulations only sel@@ ec@@ tively to protect citizens journ@@ alism and independence .
let &apos;s see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state c@@ ens@@ orship Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to the Ros@@ ary nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat to register at the state government as an &quot; organizer of the information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will organize a list of online services that make the &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the government also allows the government to make content responsible for removing content and to force them on request to compens@@ ate user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently selected websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ yar@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most common social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mailing .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has Sper@@ ing Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ruled the lock of Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to er@@ ase two English articles , the data that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication has been locked , the site has been locked up because they joined &quot; an information source that joined forces with groups in order to oppos@@ e a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey blocks the website completely . it is therefore , besides China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can &apos;t stop working .
&quot; after this week , the UK government has crossed the UK government in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to higher security powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install any @-@ time tracking programs which de@@ cryp@@ ts data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has cons@@ ul@@ ted telecommunications company and secret services on the proposal , but has other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continued until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Department of the Interior . &quot;
