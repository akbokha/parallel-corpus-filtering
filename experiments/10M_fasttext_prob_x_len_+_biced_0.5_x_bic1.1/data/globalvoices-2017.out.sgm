<seg id="1">Although I visited the United States since 2012 at least once a year I would now live for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="4">"how many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I've been dancing American music, read American writers and worked for his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who covered his murderous conspiracy with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Court with judges who wanted his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it, as if that is absolute Truth, forget all others, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the U.S. only."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in whom I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you can always be that you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very bad love letter on his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the hostile and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow-die.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he is saying exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague, express it, and publicly declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmericer and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his testimony and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number that ever reached a party candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not know Trump and his voters do not agree with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, people from all over the world, with whom I managed to entertain me about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Truman's worldview was also voted by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "by Peter Bhatia."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity, which I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for their lives, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"yet it fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues to accustom us to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser Council helped me a lot of my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those affected by them embodied my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump is a way to nominate Republican Presidential candidate, they offered me a halt and the counterpart of his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps not due to its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people voted for trump because they were either sharing rump and fanatism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, almost the heart broke me."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump electors as Rassisten.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to assign the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficially and respectless and suggests an inability to understand those who deal with another way, and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">"it shows people that their worries and fears will not be taken into account in their communities."</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these electors, from which most knows are, for Trump, because they would like to recover control over a country they are disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down differently with contempt upon those who look differently."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(bed of the WC.: as much as" Rejection of the White against all other ethnicities ";" word from white in play to the White and Whiplash, as much as chandtrauma), as it was the big Van Jones, exactly what America has made so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which belief or background it may always have America, America is every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of an Kenyaners, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America's promise and says: to Hell with polygons, religious freedom and the entire concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the rest of the rest."</seg>
<seg id="46">"at all I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who is in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud voice," No! "</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "roaring the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Americans have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and strong "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan completed his words:" God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Omar Mohammed is currently part of the ICFS Knight International Journalism Fellowship, and a leader of the Code for Africa in Tanzania, a continental technical and data journalism initiative."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">"that music, which is played in both places, has not only changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years, La Banda de Música (Music bande) has been playing in the church: one of the children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has found an opportunity for overcoming the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for their drugs and abuse."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, after a random encounter with a French pilot, a musical project started and the youth had always offered a rare hopelessness."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations toward the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they come and play with shining eyes and play in the turtle you will learn a day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically above the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - based on instruments which are made of recursive waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with readily prepared instruments, made from local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under the management of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste in instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments offered violins, viola, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayian and Latin American music as well as the Beatles music, Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez reminds of the children of Cateura, on the starting time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in trash, the children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown that he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today there is a complete orchestra, which plays on instruments from reprepared material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) features the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">"every year, the world produces about a billion metric tons of rubbish."</seg>

<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild fishing struggles.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices to shared use.</seg>
<seg id="100">"at that time, in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia before leaving the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised and slightly inclined to welcome a dementia of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the directors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised quickly against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to share it a fishing licence."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" suddenly, the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused anything, "" Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fisheries authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship during the day. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it did not succeed to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to the plundering of the country's stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"apart from Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are the six countries that then had expelled the Premier of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are equal and working together. they exchanged information and stand on each other where it goes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: the illegal fishing is hidden because it is extremely difficult to touch it. this is illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate abuse of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems can have balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snowfall empo, with the information between individual countries, these actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists existing licenses to suspect news about suspicious activities or details, which one noticed or experienced during a harbour spection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea through satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this enables the authorities to detect ships to fish in the banned areas - such as suspicious driving routes, such as suspects that a ship invites his own caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show if the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then use the assumption of such ships in their harbours. what means that the ships cannot be sold off their cargo. and that even the numbers of penalties could be forced, as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing catch is not worthwhile anymore."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Beraterally supported for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform has been created to win estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fisherman, who penetrate in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing trays that attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these are the same illegal fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other things, actions include such actions as the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of phantom enames, fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "you are targeted specifically to use the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-mosquito control system," "said Long." "formerly a ship could not fishing and a country could say 'You must not run my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'comm to me'. "and just this legale hole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">"to date, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 examinations."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that were fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing through large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that can help FISH-i, suspects even more precise ships."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be enhanced and helps to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fisherman use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. "" says Duncan Copeland, Chef Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO who also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, which can't be used by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"as a result, Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information carriers. it should help FISH-i help to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of african actually take influence on the unquestionably global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Reserve Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world by using any traceable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of it, who knows what to do - that's simply sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system destroy the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only sense criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that previously faded without license and hardly have consequences with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i involved a 33% increase in fishing revenues, since fishing boats can buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study project." "in West Africa, we will disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force in 2015. it is also fighting the illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH-i." "using security is the goal of being able to produce more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member states in Somalia could report its first major triumph in October: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was used without license, which are now banned in the meantime."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was still prohibited in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the provision of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed to illegal fishing." "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time, evidence shows that such special, collaborative study to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, New York Times and in The Guardian. situation in Venezuela spread themselves further: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of conquering the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of heavy demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They apply as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of the current president Nicolás Maduro the chance for a fundamental change; but ultimately the posture of a new choice was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in the latest articles in the context of the government in this context:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, the inflation of inflation and gesteers belong to the highest on all over the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a graceful and far-sufficient lack of food and medicine, the referendum was to retake the chance to retake its institutional structures and join a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had raised me.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times after La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">"during the first time, he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car."</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - simply all possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small in a ceiling pumping, and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day, I went to the other end of the Baracke where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted an open room and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I was paralyzed, and saw a song that were tortured on man."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field-bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same odour came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were pinned with handcuffs, and were bound to bind them."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian, who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a range of mattresses, on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"in the vicinity of the entrance, people still kept silence on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father said I saw to the prisoners, he said," Why do you guise so, asshole? ""</seg>
<seg id="254">I met "Why have you brought me anything else?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">"they were thrown into a pit, and killed by soldiers and buried them."</seg>
<seg id="257">"I know this, because my father was at home."</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms, which were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed a man.</seg>

<seg id="263">"look at the map, see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">"here, their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the process."</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra till the order came from above that they should be moved."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for shooting the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War of War'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things with home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time in the age I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>

<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I asked myself, like my father, head of security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer at the Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a crime, and I answered: and you, which you beat cars on the street?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"when you go so far, I will find you, and bring you strange."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else!</seg>
<seg id="284">That was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no sole memory to him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the trial, I showed a photo of that time, on which I wore a jacket and a turtle pullover from wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothing home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me to have been a criminal case with this crime. I said, no problem, they can put me on the load what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway I was there to say.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearances of the body is the last abhorous act.</seg>

<seg id="292">"I have children. if you only have children, one can recognize the value of one life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One further develops and recognises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"so good, you were excreted during the dictatorship of the dictatorship. but for what the bodies vanish?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children lead?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl with home, whose mother was killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have just been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but to let the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Had these people not even families who were able to pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">"the disappearances of the body is the last abhorred act, which one can do a man."</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced again, they used machinery to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed somewhere - no idea where." one will never find something, "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything stays forever.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you have killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to declare it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was in the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the idea to show my father was created during a meeting, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations because of all the abominations I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," I don't know. I did not kill anyone. "</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly, and asked me, for what the whole led patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they allegedly defended themselves were well."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me what to tell me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you have compelled me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he said," "Well, I forgive myself."</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I reimed the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>

<seg id="351">"the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also attentive to the local newspapers."</seg>

<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation of translation.</seg>

<seg id="356">"the faultful English translation was first removed initially. the name" "Drivers" "(German:" terrible car driver ") was later replaced by the appropriate as well as the grammatical name" Elder Drivers "(German:" older motorists ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police preapologized for the defect errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text, which they had been reviewed by the translator, and that the translation was not checked on their correctness before being published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we're sorry that older people felt through the inadequate correction (the translation)," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News provided some more detailed with the phenomenon of the "fearful" older car driver in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" fearbar "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved in accidents, but quite the occasion for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents of seniors. this equates to a 10% share."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation is varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">"one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text, and active language skills to transmit it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active mastery of the target language - something that is in the case of native speakers. in general the conviction that translator should not be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French mother tongue should translate the French translation by English - not from the French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no employees working with English as a mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this may be due to misunderstanding, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers who want to learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that have no foreign workers, leave translations, nevertheless, the Japanese staff, whose English language is considered the best, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrential and enigmatic sets that arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique can still not replace human translators. this applies to several languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulation in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints, often used to decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stilistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless. however, by major companies or by the government that have funding to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed a bill to "the regulations regarding the use of social networks and social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if he is accepted by the Parliament, users and users of social media must be registered in Egypt by a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"based on the law, then a place would be set up in order to provide permission to share social media, citizens and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with acceptance of the law, user would have to register users with their right names and personnel numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or cash."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, composed of six paragraphs and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defined social media as" jedwede application which is running on the internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video surveillance and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is passed when it is assumed, since the design cannot be imposed, as Egyptian authorities do not plan to register the user that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul saddle, parliamentary committees and sponsors of the law enforcement, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password to come through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a firewall at national level around Facebook. due to them, it would be necessary to submit information to the Egyptians, to access the network."</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, it is like that they could control physical public and private spaces can also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, then it means that they can submit a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not. and that is a mad system to monitor the activities of people, and also to bring it to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must initially be debated at the legislative elections and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung lies in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. prefecture Miyagi was a certain prefect ectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced evacuated; for the tsunami had vanished whole coastal towns from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition to this, Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view which progress in progress six years after the life of local communities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding agency and the survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses (in the area of the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the greatest success among the three prefectures could be Miyagi, here 80 per cent of the planned spare time were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"still, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by homelage accommodation (in the area of the war, Kazetsu juutaku), they are still trying to settle in final spare buildings."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in comfort accommodations."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, more than 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 per cent of the evacuated Fukushima in 2011 live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated ones who were travelling according to the disaster in comfort houses were converted into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>

<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of fisheries airports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fisheries airports have recovered its operation."</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident have drawn into the three prefect contours of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear waste, for only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima, are located in the nuclear plywood zone."</seg>

<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared to the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine a total image, the newspaper conducted numerous questionings under the local population and among the evacuated by. she asked them about the stand of reconstruction and even as you find, opposite the tsunami risk."</seg>

<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in the disasters prevention."</seg>

<seg id="576">"in its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has increased their attention also to the position of evacuated Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima has not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic-caused, atomic accident, who ever had to participate."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23 000 people, returned to Fukushima, moved into permanent spare time."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 state of 2017, there are still more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuation areas are most of the evacuated ones that are still in Beholfshausen, more than 50 years old. in order to repay the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima, they are competing for building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that are part of the Tokyo Olympic Games."</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">"youths of the first Nations communities in all Canada are involved with topics that are important for them. they do with hip hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshops have been working directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the pedagogues to David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in our conversations issues such as" cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable "or whatever it comes into the sense."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the ancestral area in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also known as" Highway of tears, "in which almost two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were generally not explained.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemati Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to mediate, as important to the traditional Sitten and customs, despite the influences of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in Indian languages, although the young people did not always master the languages of the first Nations languages."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation recorded, the refrain is sung in Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the youngsters involved a little help of Gary Jolly of the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the facebookside of N'we Jinan the verse is available in a transcript, as well as translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel when nobody ever got interested in me?</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on the earth</seg>
<seg id="707">"that is the day, in which you will take our cry,"</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">"but I believe, that we will rise one day"</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"so, they can grow and also prior to our youth."</seg>
<seg id="712">"thus, they can do what is intended for the creator."</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, one can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, you will be exposed to the shores of shokuhin sanpuru (," "Plastics models of dishes" ") from every dish which is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see this plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Kappabashi district of Kappabashi there is a variety of these small companies that use the plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders had documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"most of the Japanese are these plastic dishes as usual, they do not even invite them to them. however, a new trend is turned into current mobile accessories and other gadgets today."</seg>
<seg id="724">Near Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new with plastic dishes, decorated cell bands, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collection, as in this case, refrigeratormagnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin refrigeratormagnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essences will increasingly be elaborated.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a cell stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also produced this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">"and here is an apple, holding your mobile phone:"</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into coma.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon cheated are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" "Wow, cool, now I can make my mobile phone with laughing cheated?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetizing form, to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasantly."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the form of melody.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handmade salmon from dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"further quirrile plastic dishes can be seen below: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # (, as in the end of the hashtag #),"</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" fight against drug trade "in Mexico, the mischiefs and gearings occur regularly in statistics. however, these mirrored the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings together."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartells, urged the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"a day after a violent incident, anyone looks after a violent or on the communities that have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every sinking, behind every bone was in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds might never be cure."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has called the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with the drug trade live) that this victims will give a voice and stories of people who were in the fight between prosecution and cartels. "</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime makes us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if shops include because they are threatened by drug traffickers, and whole municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vivique cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fearful life changes") tells these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who is searching for a secret graves after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father only one day, her four sisters, her husband and two."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare for the job today, which we have set ourselves, go and go to the graves after the people we loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="767">"on October 13, he left the house."</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again. Emma Veleta:" it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training. "</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, which is also with me here."</seg>
<seg id="770">"at the moment, she has no income."</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father's insurance, but she does not get paid out because they demand a dying."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explains why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we have to show the international community of conflicts, fragility and government management."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a writer of animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that you should never see violence as normal, no matter what shape it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been able to know the disease and Sensational journalism since a couple of years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I am coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with images that are actually only from a textbook for criminology or files.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel as if I am the only one, I am disgusted or sad. it works as a lack of respect opposite the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equal or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin thinks he's great. and it is not normal that people listen to the" helplaten "of the offender, if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened too."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, if stories to be blown numbers in a statistic."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified, that they were" walled. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to talk to themselves, that they are spared from such tragedies, when they are not stirring and still."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" Four months Erpressant in the main city district: like a family with threats of threats. it describes how armed criminals was destroyed for month of money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business, but also their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you've lost and remember how many people can completely change your whole lives in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain never passes away, the sadness remains, the fear comes back again if you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers also changed."</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the further we walk from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will lead you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days, if weeping would dissolve my profound feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the second generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to rise in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other young ones of his age, whose parents take care of her."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a Waise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to live an egg, potatoes, tortillas, and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence, and who had to learn to live thereby."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was already over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody suffering of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a driving car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like that:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder of civil security and government of the United States government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 murders. this equates to an average of 8,5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and enters into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only few stories live in view of the new headlines, but this project reminds us of those who we don't forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "project, Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against the drug trade which has tortured the country in the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the years dipped for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, inclines to exist further."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it was misleading to be used to imagined tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of image and event -" false description "or" false context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - Don't deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire to pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tanker wagons the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte around and exploded. 230 people were killed."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region have become a dangerous pile of impact that were difficult to befall."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the Tankwagen fell victim to the victims."</seg>
<seg id="828">"correspondenier described a fireball, the dozens of houses included, including a cinema near, which was full of people who illustrate the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses forged and forged bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the imperfectionality.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria". "from Imgur-user Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015. more photos of the incident form the atrocious scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">The above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">"it shows the rows of carbonized body, which are spread on the ground during persons."</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find her end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo expires several times on social media, blogs, and other platforms, but may not be attributed to the related tragedies, especially in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what was not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the entleakian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">"eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities, before they had to flee."</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were burned down in streets and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"however, the figures could not be confirmed." no one remained back to count corpses, "said a resident on Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were broken, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only based on satellite images, the follow-up period was illustrated."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the army of army in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here, the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, as soon as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented:"</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris, two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abrupt use of the image from the DR Congo is just one in a number of failure; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>

<seg id="852">"even one step further bring personal comments, such as the example from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments."</seg>

<seg id="854">"according to a flashlight, published by the United Nations those who were able to flee battles, rape and some dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported by violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following, who brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="1135">"story tell story, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"can you give it a way, here and now, despite a language barrier with someone?"</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Incredible blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve the language diversity of big cities and appreciate it."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the born children."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"mass mortality of the world may be avoided, if we do cities, accept diversity - safe spaces, in which residents do not have to forget who they are."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often associated to understand" "these events" "instead" "listen to the audience, to appreciate, to link."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storyteller represent their history first in their own language and translate or explain it in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation will result in this way that the listeners can be embarked on it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou took account the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative of stories."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fork of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after having explained the importance of his fatting, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is that speaking to an audience that will not understand your language? "with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of exclusivity:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard them!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and organisers hope to extend this. all that are inspired by the project can be found in contact with TLS in order to organize their own story stories."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a new examination of public debts of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march began at the puertorient capitol, the government buildings of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>

<seg id="1160">"we call for financial examination and a tap committee without personal interests in public debts, with a firm, our working conditions, corresponding to the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt not her.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book which has been published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of the oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book, like movements for free knowledge will be built, and what the real costs are, with which this is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have a site to view over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something in our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Basle Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the Adra-prisons directory where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1195">"the introductory portion of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushing him to his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel has paid a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own fate, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporal beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and Digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police bases laid on the basis of a military court of his cell in Adra. "</seg>

<seg id="1204">"its place of residence and condition remain unknown, but remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Basle played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge about public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently transfer the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes was more prospective than the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to redesign the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the junction of numerous civilians and merge Greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel didn't know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would put everything to the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strike in the digital archaeology and the preservation has created a time cap, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel was unable to exclude this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream and Bashan taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">"I am overwhelmed, when I call his name."</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel brought me English, even when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with each, who has asked. he has taught other detention to read and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened me the gate for technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other detention, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without thought it was in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prospective that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she mourned the lyrics to him, when she visited him, and he translated them out of the Arab into English."</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmeric word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or age-up.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took its posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although it is still discussed above the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to humans East Indian origin or generally used as Adjectively" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook has addressed the word" Kalar "or" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the ascent of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely aborted connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's may normally be associated with racism, but the word is not automatically calls for Hasselt."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same accounting sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(camel),' Kalar OAT '(Kamel) or' kalarcaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaat stated the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, if they knew how he could relieve his back pain, he made a vocabulary."</seg>
<seg id="1302">The ku ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the questioner (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Huns is the opinion that they must be a radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be informed that Facebook has had to spread out all posts, suspicion in suspicion, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you write on factual ook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"instead, what it should be done, the mail is carefully analysed and control him by checking the following words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spiders).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these three-old nationalists who have received hate language, receive a rather good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the promotion has a strong signal to all send, the hate language might be spreading, the efficiency of this strategy doesn't stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of percussion often is a catcher and mouse game, whereby users social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative way of censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to express his friends only that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... "when I was attentive to this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post has been removed from Facebook and I was subject to the liken, post and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post" "Facebook community standards has not been dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a wide variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate-speaking nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasselt from Facebook is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author distributed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are in the country bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more than ever before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community asked questions:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma due to their platform, but it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words will only work even more hate within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support, and so words like" chair "or" peas curry "have forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not tempt them, falsely deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit, they would have a huge turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun and write the word 'Kalar' in the context of Hasselt, to see if their posts will be taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no Hasspronunciation, but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmical text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch hersencurry with a Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for his failure, who would speak blasphemy messages to his burial sites under control."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"instead of just trying the word 'Kalar', it would have been better running to see more in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where he would already make a simple majority to the law."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women will avoid women with greatest care, the name of their husbands or even of older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should be given the norm to life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced to the Indian State of Ocha by a pseudostems and had promised by her family and the village community, after having addressed a married relatives with name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not call her name, is also common among men. however, they have far less access to fear if anything, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health subjects, and housewives, came to a unique club thus quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>

<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and set up for the mining of the Patriarchs."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"since seven years, Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of her video camera on the rediscovery of practices, such as children's headers to the ban of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and heads the clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">"it reports about how these clubs are created a safe place for these women, and they were made at the same time to ambassador."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in their discussion, acted by women who did not call their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she decided on this topic, because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can identify easily."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the names of their husbands, not according to pronunciation, is a spectacle which they have pleaded not guilty and have never questioned any question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who doesn't stop this, is regarded as a woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"the tradition is so deep rooted, that we have never made any thoughts about this discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband, had never had the name to try out at home, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">About the Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started its first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoying, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, means that they don't respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on the lips," "Rohini Pawas out of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Brest of a centuries-old tradition, in which women married the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">About the Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise, there was just stoned away; another one decided to cast out the whole frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in Adrenalinert about that, with an ancient fire also broke, the women decided that they would really try to call their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a multitude of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she sat in the head: his wife couldn't stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she grabbed her, she was afraid and told that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini meant I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understandable and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as Tragen's interest in the forehead, indicating the marriage status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the cayberred dot if he would like it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not complete this, but mean, they are now in a better position to choose, even to bear him in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at any discussion sketlub.</seg>
<seg id="1520">"usually, we have lunch and water, and go out into the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to worry about women who could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives, they sang and sang about things, which they had never done before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on this problem for so many years and yet I have been working on some things, for example like our identities to our husbands, never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great, certain things can say noisy, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion case, we have entertained us about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most of them that is okay, but some wanted to carry a saline cta, a wide shirt of a pants, they have not dreamed."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of its own clothes choice, morality linked to the Saris and much more, decorate Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (upper hemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now decided to plan an excursion to Goa where they can carry Jeans, and Rohini is sure that they can do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion of discussion, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly entering the roll:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but stopped again to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some of them included me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in discussion lub know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the Feiling of movement, or its own clothes-choice - at the end of a hard to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw is explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman is going home in the club, and other people are told what we are talking about and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the International branch of the State of New York, the Minister said that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">It is supported that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked me if New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that is, with most people go an error."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," the logic to turn "to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable country, you should say that we finally have not been a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons led by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he appeared unrefuse."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"however, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as you reach the core point of the subject, the good old bodies of the authoritative feasibility is once again to be democrats, abandoned logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"during the final week, the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to its American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions he cloaked with non-answer rational style.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam on his opinion, because they didn't understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country is our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our advertised K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point where he was paid high, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog his comment posted, it points to the reviews that you should start to understand the entire commemorative publication of the conference, so that one might understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city, and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more a" city "than a country," "he declared why the elections in Singapore are so uneasier for even if we are looking forward to free and interested elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He joined Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" is not a country, "he obviously doesn't mean in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan reveals his disappointment over Shanmugam who makes a leader of a heralant generation that makes such polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am talking about what was said to the Minister of Justice of Singapore,..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which is expecting me - may I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes, right and what he is defended."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review defines the weaknesses of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam 'committed an error' or was it a friger speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is no country, we are only considered independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role in the government's government, the statements of Mr Shanmugam plays on serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the Singaporedom afford their military service, they defend their city only their own country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade for the affirmation, Singapore is, and always was a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have many Singapur of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" the defence of the country especially "," but that is not quite right. "</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of a continuing series with rumors of certain parts of the world uncovered and a different facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is asked me most in Japan is: "are you an American?</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," "I'm coming from Canada." "since 1994, I live and again in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation takes place the conversation, it is considered polite to show interest in his talk partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"at my clarification then follows the standard reply:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians do perhaps cooking in front of anger, if they are kept for Americans, but I do not disturb me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know, there is little, which distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">"this is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian banner clearly visible on their backpack, when they are travelling."</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">On the other hand...</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was, when I began 20 years ago, when I began to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>

<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadian are nice.</seg>

<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, as" nice, "means" nice, "is basically to be skeable - as the good-tired, gentle, but tragically unsignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(who has a Canadian double devils)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the actual problem exists in it that" nice "doesn't have personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">"be harmless, means inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to deserve."</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this may be something good when you want to stay unnoticed in the background, fernb of things that pass around."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go far as far as to say that the wish, free, and to be alone, is a key of Canadian."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula he is located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a coral-pink Brass frame and golden-coloured earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. yet they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for around $2.50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells us to get people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast to call them:" mom Africa! ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would not refuse to reject.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are ill, they buy them medications which they can't pay, they massage them with a balm that are exhausted from the long journey."</seg>

<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other signs from Mama Africa." mother Africa is a well-known name on the route, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that Haitians and Afrikaner can often travel to the route and that, the Africans already speak on WhatsApp of Mrs. Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of its waymen, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will be contact with Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we never leave them again," "he answered smiling." we will always be in touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they went away to report them about their journey or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known, but it is not the only sparking hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>

<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests can do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his working place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had fled with his wife and his three children before people who wanted money from him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he was asked to find an accommodation and a Unknown, a omnidirectional, has offered it its roof."</seg>

<seg id="2092">"the picture was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib brings the majority of his time inside; sometimes he sutters his screen to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"what you can rely on, there is a cigar between his fingers, or with nicotine spots to discover."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the chief of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they had lived as a felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist, which has been transferred to the conservative majority of Yugoslavia, sexuality and free expression of opinion through art and rapessings."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"but with his music that is often conspicuous with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian militants, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find in the city's hometown, but also in cities that from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted to its mind, and he can participate in his mind, with the most devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he doesn't turn it open, he sweeps on the US foreign policy for a special issue."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib believes not that his compassion for those who try to do in war zones, that he was born in Jordan, even if he was born in Jordan, and yet never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life circumstances so," emphasizes Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a person, "while in the water, Nesadan. it is the holy month of Ramadan; this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten to sunset from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot Junitag has little to do against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the snaps speak warm coffee and the scarves of the Kent cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you throw a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it avoids basic things to do - as in the public while the Ramadan is drinking water - to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, Jordanians had cancelled a show of the band Mashrou'Leila to the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontiängers contradicts Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former press conference of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert" just had to be cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singers. "</seg>
<seg id="2113">"in addition, many claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents the altitudes' legitimacy regime in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continue to take up" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not easy to be a kind of rhetoric, but actually an evident-crystalline reality contradictory in Jordan, clearly reflected in Hdaibs factory."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib was a traditional gender norms to body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vowed sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a evidfolded woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them, which they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'Honmorant' - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honour in 2016 reached its peak; however, Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law of Crime control from the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner violence," and for their release is often a year-long bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to repel the topics covered in his country for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib strives to deny that his work is politically, however, that he is not able to separate his music that is full of explicit anomalies on sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, a man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was intimidated for me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" the focus will turn on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically politically, can continue."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get what you want" - be faith or belief, Hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notices that, in Jordan, he is talking about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian OnlineProgramme Roya, to remember that his comments were torn from context, twisted and had been censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a working version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals did not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuvo, a poet of the eighth century, which still remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuoro, who would like to work in the order of the Caliph in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the actual problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Semitic Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government's attacks on freedom of expression was sanctioned and that progressive votes will be put to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service ordered several former government officials and members of the teaching staff, with the reasoning, they had expressed himself on comments on comments in social media that were related to corruption in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the concert Hdaibs, according to only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress, Mashrou'Leila arrived for him for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and internal changes. he is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from a Arab world without intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he did not only dream about his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is managed by music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not led by bombs, spreading, and on artifical ways. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time is done, Hdaib is continuing to pass, according to that resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was presented by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman has been referred to as a student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2150">This large, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!! "</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the reinforces, the drums and dancing over a thousand years have been invaded, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force Emishi into the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two pushers are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nonetheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival, the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug dealers are daily."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the fallen hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the experienced hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity even has an annual event inspired by the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there are experts to join each other in order to show who of them can create the eccentered Looks, as you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"education institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to share young people with their weapons against hairdresser tools and instead of bad advice a training in hair-art, which enables them to find work."</seg>

<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the working version of the Beitrags "Liebesmessages to guerrilla fighters" which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve has published.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel guilty, opposing affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) who encourages young people to write guerrilla's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the Guerrilla Movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombia), which forms the battle point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of Peace President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before Colombia is still a long way, until one can speak of an effective reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrillers who lived for many years in illegal camps, subjected to war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society again, who had accustomed itself to life in constant anxiety and in some cases deep hatred toward guerrilla fighters, must now hold them into their ranks and support them in the building of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly that they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's goal is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighters - that will then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as a inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Peace Laureates which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this declared that we love those people who love to write on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those who need to have much unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he told further to share his love with people that needed this year."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now can find their place in society and a new life is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2,000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never thought that someone would be forgiven</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bogotape to transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC on how they had done before, to oppose the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters full of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear up to happiness and everything that lies between "" told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had given the letters, a former fighter made me by the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because in addition to him there was a MGL pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the thorn."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I asked him, saying," Hello, what do they do? "he answered," I answer a letter that someone has written to me. ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life, someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." then, I suddenly answered the tears about the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I embraced him, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggle, and would help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of hunger. "I have never thought that someone would be forgiven for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there is waiting for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have learned only how I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the start, students and some of the FARC came together in a discussion group."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all up and grew up as a war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years we have experienced, as we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country more righteous. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never found heard and no election law, and to know that the people who were often seen as monster, and even hate people who were shot through their lifestyle and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"reality, in which the country lives, hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and so much harm to us, and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote as Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombia was made evidence that after deforestation peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to rise up and to protest against their rights. and that's also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"from the FARC now we rely on peace, a policy without arms."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defender of peace - no matter which breed, religion or ideology they hear them - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring victim, because we know of our own experience that nothing is easy. among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way, there will be many obstacles, but in common we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with dread, activists have experienced the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">"but the threat, such as a Damoklesworth about the LGBTQ community, is not just over night."</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who has dealt with us some of her experiences and talked with us about what is happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines in several months after reports, which were published reports, torture and torture, queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities that suspect suspicious men and they were in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was growing, she became aware that Chechnya was no safe place for her, which was why it moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after having experienced a group of Chechens from the gender equality of her country wife, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"for fear of her life, she attracted the last endition to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper for human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took them without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone thought of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no men to eliminate these shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos taken from my documents through the WhatsApp round."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing so, some shopping fans came up from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying:" here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechen:" how long will you honour the family yet? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up the final end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had given everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two youngsters in my right lung wings."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid - in men's men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got the threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, and wrote me - Related, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nighttime.</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the desired to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all that was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they created absurd demands: some told me, I let it prove that I had not changed through the streets and I say that I had not changed my sex in the official television that everything was only bad speaking, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baseline size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic is disappointed. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we can not touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she was wearing a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a darkened window and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after the third time, it was clear to me that there was a little lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number of human rights - it turned out to be persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to share their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something unbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without register, without identification, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe, you warn in security, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">You know in which hotel you steckert. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality. however, this is a table theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"some traditional Caucasian elements, I still bear in myself."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish it, this secular barrier can't overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I am really trying to look like the person, to which she remembers them from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who received a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also, that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"that, as I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they will take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end, a proof that the so-called" honour "has learned through blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are you still arrested even gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it wasn't too many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relations, or those of their relatives have been left to place the Kadyrow court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there to present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they had been attacked in any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but systematically submerged to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a assumption or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after their beard had grown."</seg>
<seg id="2339">"since then, there was nothing new of them."</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and so-called Lord, this person was even involved as these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now they were not presented as bandits, in addition there were no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why should I not allow this people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutations and kidnappings of people, who were invited to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already took place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I believe that before 2003 I was already familiar with a lot, when I was still living there - and I had never encountered problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia initially wanted to bring us to the" civilian "," but ultimately put us back in the stoneage. "</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were pumped; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of the Scharia has never shaken me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and all the city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that means "Spotte not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it often says to children, when they are making fun."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes from you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never have insulted me, never hunted, and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these gifts work?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he started talking about morals on morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he didn't talk about us, but above the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless - one could sense, as the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had vowed and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic increased steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity will you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waiter.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"besides, I am still active as activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I come unidentified with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we perfectly organize Teetreffs, collars, I gifted them to the hospital and help them to get eating cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't leave a cent.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered this man himself when I ablute the varietal varietal.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alworking.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Tschetchens, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no oscillation with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestan have who, the Kabardiner, have those who have Russians also; on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going into the mosque and while the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"do you know, many think about transpsidy of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry I am here so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I don't know that I am myself.</seg>

<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community based in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to contest its native Arab population."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power over and in 1925, undertaking great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women react, especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought well-thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women today still earn less money, despite the same education."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"however, women are still under strict observation, when it comes to do what they are doing with their body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards are still responsible for women, sooner or later in various areas of life to a glittering blanket, and that discrimination based on the sex is still across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is conscious and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and triple them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to talk on skin color, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I agree on what kind we have been physically active, sealic and verbal abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, made many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">But still all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing "their voices and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexual violence, there is an institutional form of motivating violence, which we suspended black women on two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or above, black women and women of other ethnicities and women are less likely to earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the other hand, I want to consider all men, all men and all men, neither any skin color any other rights; on the other hand, I cannot consider as a black woman, in whose center the white woman is to take into consideration unjustly, unjustices in their thinking, as well as to the skin color one person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and I won't fight for my belonging, in a white-feminist-oriented spies that always has always rejected me and countless other black women and again."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner was beating in 1851 in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a deserted and marginal essence."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to advance their egoeccentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will not try to try white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different approaches, and rendering the white feminism, still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of myself full of feminism and to join me from feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of being a white feminist paradigm, which is so stubborn than a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we will define black women according to our own ideas and go into the Sphubs, which are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which they can be able to defend ourselves and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered to make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately separatism and exclusion after having read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift the black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized because of my dark skin and due to my being as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life neither outdated, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine published in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content-sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"in the past 7 years, Nabil Musa traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special issue through the region of Iraq in Iraq. its mission aims to consciously improve the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa that explains us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I definitely wanted to do something for the river we had lost than I was a child," "Musa tells."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dust extracting, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterfall Alliance - which works in it and works to protect the rivers, streams and water routes in Iraq as well as the local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the honesty and importance of his work in a question:" if we wouldn't have any water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced for Ensia von Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq and multimedia journalist, filmed and published."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the emphasis on their work is followed, some considerable subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video photography and new multimedia techniques that can tell their stories to their stories."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and processed version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" by turally. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilichine Women) that reports about violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"Ada Báez, a police commander, said that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time has passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the files, but more could not do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as a further wife Balbuena, due to abuse, profit also benefited from Ada Báez nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife moved back their ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">"to break the vicious circle of violence against women, it is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are reimited at all, they will not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men that they misuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women admit to be victims of violence at all of the prosecution."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"holding 1 punches and statistical analysis, 2 unseen failures and a legal system that has nothing subject-immt3 of the laws: good approach, deficient realization and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women really are abuse, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports that show not even the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the figures available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Court of Attorney passed 9600 ads for domestic violence. at 70% of it, violence against women went on."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements came by the police.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace dishes. here, 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">This statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi only few of these crimes are actually indicated. "on any woman who are refunded in Paraguay due to psychological abuse. come 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this will be refunded to every woman who do not do this," "said the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a separate crime, the prosecution authorities cannot document appropriately, how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">"the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violence."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible Missions and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Hardítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera it was insisted that she called his name all of her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but nevertheless, however, this should always regret it."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos. but two years she carried the psychic violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier this, I thought that only women had happened to submissive, because they are fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he was isolated."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever had the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long from Carlos, and left him not before."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost the way, when they wanted to say that victims of abuse are at least a certain complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which does not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner they blended."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all involved in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can speak with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorias, everything began with psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">"after all, their wealthy partners eventually managed to convince them that they were worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads with the authorities stayed without a result and also of their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a trial against their former partner who developed into an inconspicuous jurist struggle between Paraguay and their home country, where it was mainly around money, power and the influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"law laws: good approach, deficient implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way of residues and a struggle against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great problems with the application of laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the paraguayischen parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porter (# Principal)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiftMenos (# non-inless) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">"the original design of the law looks forward to declare Female d to an independent perpetual crime, as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia."</seg>
<seg id="2532">"so the legislature was changed in some points to win the MPs for the Law, that feared the way for the decriminalisation of abortions that are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment."</seg>

<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need on-site medical research, there are two reasons: for one missing in the offer of global health, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"illnesses such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread effects as elsewhere, and lack of investments for exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research, which will be carried out by African scientists themselves, with its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conveyed for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India, such as" Open Source "plant producers change global food production"</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which offers solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton breed lettuce into the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company provides 114 sorts, such as Outreddish, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work has been made only by its own intrupulsion and the question how many salads of salads can get borders."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented, and that he could not continue to be used for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents have not only used for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green or crispy leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more such patents have been filed for ever more plants such as cereals or carton sites. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security to ensure the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton still breed lettuce, but he needs to do so much longer because his work is always more effective."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if a rock brownstone would lie in a river, in order to get up."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents have to go too far away."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new type of perfumes, because all the features are patented." he makes it as good as possible, trying to breed those characteristics which he would like. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is always bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds like this, as it would come from the IT-area and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software for alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called to life in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property, and so suitable for plant breeders permanently."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, briefly called Ossi, US breeders can also undertake care of them that others are able to freely use them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they can't continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seed, and not immediately out - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security as well as for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, a role in greater interaction such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to stick the latter not or only little by using them seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not employed with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, we need control over the plant in global agricultural industry, which, for example, should also be able to buy food locally locally and sustainably producing vegetables, as it should be cultivated on farms in the global agricultural industry, as well as to know how this vegetable is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food-confident, without seed-confident, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative is obligated to provide other seed companies freely. thus, their purpose in contrast to patented, seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available Genpool is due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always limited, shrinkable."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, a Director of Ossi, has been engaged in her doctoral variation with genetic variation of carrots and their availability. it found out that about one third of all box features are protected as intellectual property, which is either unsuitable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates are not yet, but experts such as Luby suspect that massensely inned plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so far that they have targeted features - from such as improves their flavor or their color up to such as they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is growing through increasingly more patents. but genetic diversity is currently unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse prior to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Spreader Carly Scaduto realize that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Monsanto activities. with a total of four genbanks and the cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company establishes the company for the preserving of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it does not contradicts that intellectual property of other breeders, as" patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan to follow everyone once the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection is not inhibits innovations, but promotes them by being able to provide more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different way: 20 years for waiting, until a patent strap, certainly don't support innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for so long, to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one should have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general well and should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetaries are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what we do, and it is impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interfere with the concept to patented plant features:" we do not create the characteristics itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants are formed by themselves, as breeders, we finally have no idea how plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" he who breed a variety, also breed its own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in the industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, which are required for the cultivation of herbicides, breeders in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exact. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, it will create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject it or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile, or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders in avoidance of plant patrons, would be:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than the company that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to constantly need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years self-competition," "he says." "with a patent one is really easy for 20 years before the competition." "worldwide resonance"</seg>
<seg id="2683">"indeed, the US seem to be a leader in the" Open Source "cattery; the concept itself spreads rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the center for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed programme. for obtaining the seed crops, the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports her to come to "open source" seed and sell her own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agrecol works on an open-source license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from land to land, absent due to Ossi obligation not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in early November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally farmed plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, a statement is not yet no law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement these new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the" open source "plant movement and worldwide trend towards the orientation of seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for the open source" "Open Source" "program for Open Source" "seed systems, is responsible for the scheduled next year of the official starting signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a combination of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC) and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide in order to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, a Verbund of Aid organizations like the WK Kellogg Foundation, including McKnight Foundation and others - a report that farmers may have to share, share, and improve the seed policy, so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report also the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphasises - a connection, by the Luby von Ossi, hopes that soon more people will be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has been considered, where and how some is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role, so Luby." we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their foods. "</seg>
