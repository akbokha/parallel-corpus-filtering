that is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it was spectacular that the NSA illeg@@ ally owned Tel@@ eph@@ ones by Americans . &quot;
&quot; it is another chapter , which should leave a permanent impression . &quot;
&quot; in this case , he describes a cat@@ astro@@ phic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally delivered dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t liked the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified R@@ isen and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became the symbol of the patterns of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; however , it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect this information , and if they can not protect the identity of the Mu@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so , when the government headed by R@@ isen , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters had already dealt with him : he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was therefore living with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government had dropped to R@@ isen . &quot;
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring the rep@@ orters and sources always hide less .
&quot; instead of failure and roug@@ h@@ ens to make statements , this could do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , concerned his telephone calls secretly , &quot;
&quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ kin@@ e information , its lending , and even travel tips with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and cra@@ fting . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has convicted more than all US governments in front of him .
&quot; now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government has taken a lot of work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we are setting the press coverage on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more possibilities to address all . &quot;
&quot; but as the technology of the government allowed to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; indeed , they can receive this from the moment in which they are contact , rather than in the desc@@ endant , in the testimony . &quot;
&quot; today there are communications software that had not been written , as R@@ isen had written his book , and it is essentially more secure than normal emails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source conversion system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s Internet , which was developed by us by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working , developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to an news page , like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents , or send documents , as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot find more information secretly , and many of the information they would like to request would not be available from the out@@ set . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments develop new spy technologies that are all endangered . &quot;
&quot; it is to ensure that not only supplier of technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to kill abuse . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; who wants to know about ab@@ normal@@ ities in the supply of soldiers , and from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alert to the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ Street @-@ Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks . thank you .
&quot; &#91; 3 April 2016 &#93; &#91; the &#93; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; will reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; the &#93; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; have been hidden in tax haven . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to give an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a rectangle of 11 million documents in the Panama &apos;s based law firm . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small view into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we will receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you address that ? &quot;
&quot; in fact , we see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a bund@@ led of brutal Syrian dict@@ ators Bashar al @-@ Assad post@@ erior companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous for the next publication , and the next revealed documents . &quot;
now this sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems cry from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address it ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens , not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few , their assets to hide and swal@@ low -- something we have been discussing and un@@ veil . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax haven &apos;t work . &quot;
I always imagine like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; thus , one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the US .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , that sc@@ andal to this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans , who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle , after which these tax haven &apos;t work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a lot of data from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more inst@@ ances and examples that have connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to establish a company than for a library to get a library . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees to prevent school children .
it has allowed frau@@ ds to qu@@ ench especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that everyone concerned us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers , who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; it really sho@@ cked us , that all up to a lawyer &apos;s lawyer did make suggestions as he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ positions . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course not anyone handed over money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer which comm@@ ences to our uncovered investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single top pole , involved in sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , established through corruption , tax cur@@ ses , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; to manage this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules in order to make this type of behaviour .
&quot; this may sound very much as usual , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if there is nothing ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as borro@@ wed optim@@ ist I can certainly see that something has begun to change .
&quot; during the last few years , we have seen demonstrations to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been recorded at national regi@@ sters at national level , who really stands behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ations , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as means to worry in the US and global for more transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people who will fur@@ ious , if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind different companies . &quot;
we need executives in the economy that arise and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem , and deplo@@ y it through laws this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the in@@ transparency , which now makes this kind of tax cur@@ ses , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after being completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my matters .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just met him only ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know whether he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das . &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me saying : &quot; I have an air mat@@ rat@@ ze . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ red the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken down ? &quot;
a wild sleeping in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , at Z@@ eh@@ en@@ pointed at the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not mad .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he bought from me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view angle .
&quot; maybe people who were sold in childhood than strangers were actually sold , actually friends who were waiting for it ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air mat@@ rat@@ ze , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mat@@ rat@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; let us take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ xed , my ro@@ omm@@ ates , and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked out .
&quot; I think creativity can do it , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new Mit@@ bewohner Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something . our apartment is included in a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and established as &quot; air mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mat@@ rat@@ ze on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ettes were completely different , because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we talked to our last guest , the door fell into the castle , star@@ red Brian and me . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay for our rent ?
things came into the rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ates , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
&quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors is done when you visit . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite strange people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missile would be ign@@ ited .
but she did not do them .
&quot; no one who is still in consol@@ ation , would be investing in a business which allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
&quot; because we all have learned as children , strangers are dangerous . &quot;
&quot; if you have a problem , you can talk to things that can be good . we could design@@ ate . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust in design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design be so hard ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
&quot; I would like to give you a cost @-@ sample , which is the degree of confidence . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in the hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your left phone on your left seat .
this silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door .
because the only thing is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger to the hands ?
most of the people feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
but who actually has Al Go@@ res mobile phone now ?
&quot; could you pro@@ claim on Twitter , that it dict@@ ates for the office of the President ? &quot;
you can return the cell phones now .
have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor could only be presented with his name , when he would tell whence he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine that they would have 150 findings , who say , &quot; &quot; he can really hold very well ventil@@ ated cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ done feedback system strengthens trust decisive .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
&quot; it was hard for people to give negative subjects . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest appearances , before we put them online . &quot;
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are about age and homes . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ ference .
&quot; exciting , it will be exciting if you add the call to a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments . &quot;
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ essments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation sti@@ pen@@ ing simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
&quot; moreover , we knew that trust is dependent on how much one can be priced . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you say too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells us too much , such as : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request also is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , e.g. &quot; t@@ olle works of art in your apartment ! I am doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to create this degree at op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of text field to recommend the correct quantity text . we also give tips to which subjects you should write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the correct design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; with which we had not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than prepared to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need which had not been covered before .
&quot; for us , business is very good for us . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
&quot; there were guests who have been qu@@ eting parties , or have devast@@ ated homes . &quot;
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these phone calls . I &apos;m sorry if I just think about it .
&quot; dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the An@@ c@@ fer , and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us further . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction had a problem of 123 millions , but had a problem . &quot;
because people trust one another .
&quot; if confidence works , it may arise . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel that save one life even though they are not really familiar .
&quot; you ride a hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel sol@@ itary , they bring books . &quot;
&quot; you can stay one even longer , without charge the extra nights . &quot;
I recommend it only ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay will run . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
it is about an economic retail here .
&quot; but now just call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; will not just be justified . &quot;
Share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people lay a part of itself open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is to be compared with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would , however , if traveling would be a rich buffet from local import ? &quot;
&quot; what would be when on every place you visit , a group there would have to wait a place there , to place a thor@@ ough and a pub @-@ pent@@ our quarter , one of whom you have never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn to cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to make homes of reason for inter@@ pret@@ ations ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have the thought of a common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow ourselves to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and sc@@ ot@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government , &quot;
&quot; residents are offered now . students who were looking for a stay , &quot;
&quot; were treated with people , whose children were out . they have been incub@@ ated programmes , &quot;
&quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a fore@@ igner or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
there were also hospitality before .
there were already similar websites in front .
so why did our work exactly ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the correct design with the inventory of trust . &quot;
design can help us to overcome deeper pre@@ ten@@ te pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I think that &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about every time when a red Maz@@ da went over to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design can &apos;t solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks . thank you .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; supp@@ ressed or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ vest , a terror ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the airport at the airport .
that is really true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; so , the media people represent , that look like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
they probably do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslims : it is great , you know . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double Espresso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a se@@ al@@ ant @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ cian ;
and I am a practic@@ ing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to take this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
&quot; no , not as homosex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ust@@ ige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , although the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only passive the faith of my parents .
I have the Qur &apos;@@ an .
&quot; I read it , thought that he was in question , doub@@ ted and believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow de@@ vot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ ans .
sometimes the beauty of the rhythm brings me to weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone is perc@@ ei@@ ving you , you understand completely , and what loves somehow ? &quot;
so it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in essence the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had taken place at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Express News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ crafts in buildings , people spar@@ ked out of the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should I do something ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and heard , &quot; ... &quot; Muslim &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; not only my country was attacked , but in N@@ u , the deeds of others turned into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West in the USA to move into a new town and begin with the construction studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove me -- as we were silent -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment this night , in a new town in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Do not reject you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday in the week -- the day when Muslims gather for the prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this very first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were holding for Muslims , in the open air , and struck . &quot;
there really were Bran@@ dan@@ ese on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something really felt right .
&quot; because people who had attacked this country , attacked our country . &quot;
I lost the rage of people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain continuously itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and join Muslims .
they are talking about my church as of an tumor in the USA &apos;s body .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is considered as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor only stops under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is in@@ correct .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital body . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , narr@@ ative and Olymp@@ ion@@ ities . &quot;
will the closure of the United States be safer ?
maybe there will be a few parking spaces but not stop terror .
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant , and show larger ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; during the radical process , it has found that he will start online . as the first one assumes that the person believes that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their role world when they recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology grounds on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you throw a look at it , it doesn &apos;t drive on what they are blo@@ wn in their &quot; Holy Scri@@ ptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding im@@ am told me recently an amazing history :
a girl came to him because she had previously decided to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit , with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her mind for iniquity in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger , it was a major goal for the instrumental orchest@@ ras by extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke about a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam set the connection to God and her church again .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , they kept it to join the IS . &quot;
it was an insight like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family .
but how does normal Americans work ?
how does it affect anyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption affect our democracy every day ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies - show : if we fear that happen at least three things .
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you submitted testing messages , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they would rather agree to Muslim attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood for Muslims had shi@@ fted upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this was three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as first but the toxic air of fear harm us all .
&quot; with the assignment of collective blame , it is not only about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
&quot; he was very promising in dental Faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the most sweet , most generous man , whom they knew . &quot;
she visited him and he showed her his CV . she was bl@@ ur@@ ned and said :
&quot; when has become such a sealed young man from my mouth ? &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne &apos;s visit to her brother and wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered her , just like the Sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had been in the afternoon , as with an execution , after he posted utter@@ ances against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ at@@ ism cannot be only in@@ mor@@ ally , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to start .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed safely at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not a light decision , because it was about what America was going to do with our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in whom we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and moved my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw I left . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement to thank and welcomed our guests , because half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I have collapsed . &quot;
&quot; these people were there , because they had courage and compassion , and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
are you going to go for sure ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thanks a beautiful place !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a nerve hit . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a memorial with deep @-@ depth , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did it with the greatest ever @-@ carried out study on Muslims around the world , people want to use normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work , and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no way , I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people like an exception as a rule , the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is short to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before the air @-@ package set up in our social awareness , a autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ro@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in eng@@ aging room . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ corro@@ sive structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ence and in general to react on natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility of an autonomous flight .
&quot; thus , a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it must be colle@@ c@@ tively know where the mobile objects are in space . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alizing technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine which the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest image . e.g. , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ;
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ vol@@ gler , it is efficient in the advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most powerful whis@@ kers , it can ho@@ ver , and thus has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a flip side . &quot;
a limitation of tail@@ oring is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ences such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which location the optimal position can be improved and the performance can be improved .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which leads to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about machines with a thousand movable parts that are gathered together to inj@@ ure you .
&quot; before decades , pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled flight devices that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ or . &quot;
we discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only an event@@ ful part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no c@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ des , no further actu@@ ators or checking surfaces , just a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although mechan@@ ically simple , it happens in the interior living very much so that it can fly stable , and moving around in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear . to bring it to flying , I must throw it exactly properly . &quot;
&quot; the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood , to throw it exactly if all is looking , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in Gen@@ u@@ el@@ iness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ ence in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the effective ability , &quot;
&quot; in space to move in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; much is shown in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft engines .
this revol@@ ves in clock@@ wise .
and the others against clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , a bit wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or one battery -- can fly the machine if also restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration explo@@ res synthetic swar@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units offers a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we recorded commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and st@@ alls it with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
&quot; every unit knows where it is in space , and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
&quot; on Broadway , Broadway wants to exercise a flying lamp @-@ screen on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , the wages in development and the rh@@ einf@@ o act lies . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creature , to form them in so spectacular manner . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive professional and economical potential is the bag on the i .
thank you very much .
&quot; just 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes turned around in a very far distant galaxy , so they turned into pure energy so that the mass of three s@@ uns in a tenth degree in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , she lighted up more brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe . &quot;
it was a very big hit .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was given into space @-@ time feelings and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events first .
&quot; ago , 1.3 billion years ago was a multi @-@ cell life on earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God arise with us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; some 25 years ago , a group of particularly mu@@ sty -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of C@@ alt@@ ech , decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ating black holes . &quot;
most kept them for crazy .
but enough people recognized it as a mad gen@@ ius so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vit@@ ation Ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increase what the recognition performance improved enorm@@ ously . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zed black holes through the earth is through . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector through .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the goodbye to my father &apos;s father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked for , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investig@@ ating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their symptoms such as lig@@ o measur@@ able signals for 23 years . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cr@@ us@@ k in the feelings of space and time .
&quot; while passing the shaft , the room and its entire content will be stretched into a direction and in the other gest@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; to illustr@@ ate , lec@@ turers in courses for rel@@ ativity was often a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; de@@ fle@@ eting and du@@ cks , de@@ fle@@ eing and du@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , everyone was stretched by us during the wake of the waves and gest@@ ed . the re@@ proof of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the coma , followed by a 1 . so , one explained the lig@@ o @-@ staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear career . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text on gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os described the hunt after the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are huge . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cist are inv@@ entive , and with the support of public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial covers , the size of your cell phones . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or map of things , by aware of that of several points coming light around you . &quot;
&quot; in the killing , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things to make you very much : &quot;
child &apos;s face is about .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume , to close behind the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; number Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t work with them simple images of objects in all .
&quot; but by doing changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area . &quot;
&quot; thus , when we convert wave pattern to sound , we can literally speak the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has already been busy . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , cir@@ cling simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two body very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound change . it sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu . &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; Some@@ one , who knows what he must hear , knows this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar weight , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each other a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the All and the In@@ visible .
much in all we can -- practical or basically -- do not see .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why massac@@ red stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about all .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon , and silicon . &quot;
we will never see where these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves pier@@ ce iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the pri@@ st@@ ion is covered by his own neighbor . &quot;
through gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimi@@ stic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen , we will never see , and from which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover that we listen . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Lig@@ o found the first stop of things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as lig@@ o they observe , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . black holes are so to speak the sour cream for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us to get a completely different view of the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
&quot; AA : the challenge is now to be , as cour@@ ageous as possible . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and All .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine itself ? &quot;
now the time is great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks . thank you .
some time I tried out an experiment .
&quot; one year I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; , &quot; I was afraid of that . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I be live on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I begin with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , feared my fear . &quot;
&quot; keep my fear , keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life to a un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for all &quot; Sch@@ itt@@ ens &quot; for un@@ explained reasons . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it would be a wa@@ iter out of the south . &quot;
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my mu@@ til@@ age . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me whether I could play with her , when I was at the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new life setting in my family . from then I swear to play with them as soon as you do , I am saying , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I stri@@ ve very .
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a stunning side effect : only recently I was fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; approach to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think things from , raise up to life . &quot;
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create Cre@@ ire TV . I smoke television .
&quot; I have TV , in a big style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for this , 70 hours of program in the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
every broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that does not exist before .
the budget for a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million TV , four TV programs , four TV channels , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , simultaneously four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments which I created yourself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ able . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who this is still doing ?
&quot; no one , this is why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you all of you who work so hard to whether you &apos;re now a company , a country or a class@@ room , so that I tell you that I don &apos;t just talk about the computer , so that I say : I understand that there is no dream of dreams . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I &apos;m moving in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I introduced troops , I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as a dre@@ aming of a high tone , one takes a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and stiff@@ ness , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing is that sum@@ s . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working goes well .
&quot; a Sum@@ mon starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could always ride on it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people take care of that , when I speak these sum@@ s , I speak writing that writing to me joy . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong . it does .
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- as I began working with TV production , when I started working and work to work and work , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s ! &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you can &apos;t get different than size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , do not feel different than to stri@@ ve to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ mon .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ to be .
maybe it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it &apos;s called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it in question . &quot;
&quot; to set a clear thing : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more the more superior , the more things are at the same time , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations I have . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this Sum@@ mon ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; rev@@ amped , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their Mama is an only working title .
&quot; Har@@ per tells us : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son said , &quot; Bi@@ bs , I would like to go to Sh@@ on@@ da . &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a titanium .
they are baby equipment .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work no longer . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s didn &apos;t come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekend , no re@@ mor@@ se , not deleg@@ ating , don &apos;t sleep , don &apos;t sleep , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just didn &apos;t have fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some like thinking : &quot; hypo@@ cr@@ ate yourself , the author &apos;s author . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you are doing , you are working , you &apos;ll love to be a teacher , a mother , to be a teacher , a mother loves to be a teacher when you know the sum@@ s , and knows how to stop the sum when the Sum@@ mon stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song li@@ stens to my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ in &quot; represents me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to outside , late and she says : &quot; &quot; mom , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to tell no more than two things :
&quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here all changes my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; mom , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
we play and enjoy their sisters and we laugh so much and I &apos;m very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum@@ mens , I can &apos;t do anything except . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , they exist no longer . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are stick@@ y fingers and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , tender voices , juni@@ per pins and the song , in which it &apos;s about , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen leaves . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy ub comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel when I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we forgot .
&quot; the sum , the work um@@ ming , the titanium dioxide , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I say you who I am , if I am managing my brain using the broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not working specifically .
it depends on joy .
real sum@@ s depends on love .
&quot; the sum@@ s is the stream , which comes from the vitality . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
&quot; real sum@@ s igno@@ res the printing of history , which are experiencing the experiencing tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; true sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered to me God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it just is love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I am doing this for a fixed rule , so I can set myself down as workouts from any fault . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the Sum@@ mon again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not an@@ sat@@ in so how to work .
&quot; the truth is hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to be at work as a home .
&quot; this agreement is painful , because what a person is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , none of them . &quot;
&quot; we shave around the garden , back and back , moving and round . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we cut down soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel predominantly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children tell me how to live , and the sum of the universe ful@@ fil@@ s me . &quot;
I play and play until I wonder : why have we stopped working with the games ?
you can also say it ! let them always say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you &apos;ll keep me na@@ ive for a day@@ dream .
&quot; well , you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at the most of 15 minutes , until they fall into something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ae@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and speak my te@@ ens daughter for 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need it not . &quot;
anyone can open 15 minutes even at a Bad @-@ La@@ une @-@ Day !
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no steering . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children should make your bed . &quot;
but 15 minutes are there !
&quot; my children are my well@@ being , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I victories . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got abandoned when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why do not get full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to be returning when I &apos;m not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without any games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it meets me and my soul . she runs out to new ideas . I don &apos;t use it in full trains and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like this sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the Sum@@ mon that Sum@@ mon is not me ... not anymore .
soap bub@@ bles and stick@@ y fingers with friends .
that is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is s@@ no@@ zzle , that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything in handle . my brain is still working yet . my bon@@ fires burn yet .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier are me and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land that I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more it makes this unusual , un@@ ning , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel like this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things , I aw@@ aken for life . &quot;
&quot; it belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more .
Titan@@ en found no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surg@@ eries .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from a second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us , neuro@@ surgery is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor that tries to improve the nerve functions through different surgical interventions .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the best @-@ known , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ ary stim@@ ulation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deeply in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improved . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which l@@ aths satisfy with high @-@ quality trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I want to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at the moment I was a Senior Physi@@ cian and worked day and night in the emergency .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that the brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a is an@@ gled and incl@@ ined with skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a .
&quot; to save life , one needs to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
sometimes you need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throw away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
&quot; to increase cells from a tissue , comparable to a small children who are taken out of your family . &quot;
&quot; you must find the correct diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve it . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded . &quot;
he looked under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; maybe you still know from the Bi@@ ological Less@@ ons , that stem cells are in@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small knots of brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
&quot; they never die , they are immort@@ al . &quot;
but these cells were different .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks they died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell @-@ population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand how they came .
they come from these cells .
this blue and red cells hot Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ery cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the fo@@ etus , they ensure the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find it at higher concentrations near brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of bra@@ in@@ mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells that Jean François did
and then mark colour to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re@@ im@@ planted them at the de@@ position of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transpl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ plant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ plant the same cells in the damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a couple of weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they van@@ ish . &quot;
in the second scenario we had an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
&quot; the evidence that they show , these small points are these small points . these are the cells we paint in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; here , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot;
does these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injuries ?
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual skill task . &quot;
they had to take feed pellets of one tablet .
they made it very well .
&quot; when they achieved a stable skill level , we passed the mot@@ ic Cort@@ ex of the motor @-@ mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; then the monkey were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it was done with people , they re@@ covering spont@@ aneously at a certain degree , just like a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree just like the monkeys .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey reaches his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , they see the monkey that was spont@@ aneously repeated . &quot;
he can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ m@@ pl@@ antation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we found much more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; but our dream is still , they are im@@ planted with people . &quot;
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the resources to cure itself . &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do this . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I am definitely . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
&quot; BG : it is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take to get to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you must perform this study using a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate treatment , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study . &quot;
&quot; first , you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we make a big mistake , as of course . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing ge@@ vity .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great Nach@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely democratic .
&quot; actually democracy is in us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared that the democratic process in the Euro@@ group was un@@ mistak@@ able that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - do not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ad@@ missible friends who would have repeatedly said that democracy would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy .
&quot; I beg you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ ous democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are dar@@ ken@@ ed , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twins @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt of the debt , which throws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the debt of debt , &quot;
but only few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous , who would be anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one might produce the debt , and even all the things that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , the US invested 3,4 trillion US dollars invested in all the wealth of wealth , such as industrial plants , machines , office building , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 trillion US dollars sounds a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars , which was at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions ; and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ changes and real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which do not dis@@ agree with the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not invest in which they could not invest in which they will not kill him that his son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
&quot; un@@ intenti@@ onally , the circumstances leads to it , that o@@ pus kills him . &quot;
that is my shar@@ ks with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely waste art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
is democracy now the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a company form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally got too many .
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the job value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ makers on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms , but not only the right to freedom of expression , but it is important and crucial that they gave them right to political co @-@ determination in questions of the public authorities . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy is not long kept --
&quot; like a candle , which light@@ ens very light , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ democratic demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; during the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizen and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on Magna Cart@@ a &apos;s values , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came first , when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was transferred to politics , while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- a Democr@@ ati@@ e@@ Free Zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democratic demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ her@@ ent fight between the two , and the economy gradually mig@@ r@@ assed the policy . &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are not so earlier than before ?
there is not a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is that one can be in the government today and still not in power because the power from politics into the economy is separated and the areas separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is in about as a herd of pir@@ ate who feeds on so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated that they were hungry at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized that it grows through the self @-@ caused depression itself . the power of corporations increasing , the ine@@ quality is rising and the management of the corporations are anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their company . &quot;
&quot; the successful capitalism &apos;s successful &quot; demos &quot; increased from democracy , the higher the twins are , and the greater the waste of human labour and prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and the fore@@ igner . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had an idea just 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t matter .
the teaching of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robot .
&quot; the problem is , as long economy and politics separate areas , the automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we need to combine the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics again , and we consider that we will recover the re@@ unified area , otherwise we will end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy which can be published in the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is not , whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements , which he will survive . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism are going through a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to those in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines are serving , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations the sense of life . &quot;
I think we are optimi@@ stic .
&quot; so what need it , so how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in the practical implementation I want to tell you , in all things , some examples call . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : ask a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what man is working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there is no distinction between those who belong companies , but not in it , and employees working there , but the company does not belong to where the company does not belong to capital and labour , and ultimately no emp@@ iri@@ v@@ ous twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : please just imagine that our national currencies would have a free gay exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 biggest developing countries &#93; , in interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; continue to imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country , into a joint fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment is rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
&quot; the problem was that , at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it . &quot;
&quot; today we have them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe you is at the same time liber@@ als , in which they privileged persons preferably , and mar@@ x@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or are we going to sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; the answer depends on how we decide together , together . &quot;
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks . thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you agree to yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do that , the technological development is a massive decline in economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers are known as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ ful Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the supper of the Red@@ ner , you have told us very clearly what you keep from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the license of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of the economy is , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democr@@ atically @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain extent , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; -- Do you remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s an error , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , How John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical for the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; so , China is now to take to do what the West has done in the 19th century , cra@@ wling with hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as Finance ministers in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say goodbye to self @-@ commitment , and the continuing den@@ ial that a massive decline line through the euro@@ zone went and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are trying to get a business system that is not viable , can be found in life through political will and auth@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed . &quot;
BG : what transformation will you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change their setup .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- harvest@@ ing ...
&quot; if there is a Minister for Finance , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , particularly in a so @-@ called situation , claims that he did not have any mistakes , then it &apos;s a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to be subject to the extension of the cancellation of the cancellation of the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the monetary policy to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to put our government in case , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the conditions that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have passed a cat@@ astro@@ phic programme for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the Bank@@ ers who imposed us this policy , was stressed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive door of conversations , you still seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone , opposite to someone who lives and loves . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro zone did not survive .
&quot; for if they are not survived , the forces of the forces will be ro@@ om@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this won &apos;t have been dis@@ astro@@ us alone for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we send ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be well toler@@ ated to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having been at T@@ ED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for making the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , it is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows , how many shows this evaluation . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted , where , after you have looked after a s@@ quad@@ ron , your brain asks : &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that was enough to tell you what turn off at this end . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry , on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor badly , they simply do not delight . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the print is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something like that , therefore Roy Price will not risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he will hold a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses by a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode each of this shows , and puts it online , where she can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives free stuff for free , one is access@@ ing , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are viewing this episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are watched during watching this shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; when you start the show , when you start the show , the parts you will ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
&quot; collect millions of data to decide on these dates , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com more about four Republican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many to remember that show , because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 -- so on average , but not exactly what &apos;s Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly how Roy is he always searching for this super show , but he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of running a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so on the reviews they like shows , their course , shows them etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience : which shows them , which producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went into a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series over a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know that show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; two very competent , data sealed firms . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is it that lies ?
&quot; because the logic said somehow , that all should work with everything . &quot;
&quot; if one collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years to statistics as a back @-@ up .
they are optimized by very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good television , right ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is a little frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time in which we are able to meet more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health System is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software . come in touch with this software you are in prison .
&quot; if anyone is here in the US in prison and to dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al is done or not . &quot;
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show will be good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always creates the best results . this is not aware that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data will also be considered in@@ correct .
&quot; yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can be predicted due to data analysis explo@@ sions from flu , the worse way - by data analysis of the Google search . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was great news coverage . the success of the success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it was simply not working , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand anything .
&quot; despite all these mistakes po@@ uring data in decisions of life an -- at work , with legal en@@ forcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gen@@ etics -- a territory , where some very smart people have un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some samples about the difference between data and non @-@ successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; to take up this problem in its components , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as second , you put the single parts together to deal with a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to take apart and re@@ launch . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help cut a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
&quot; they are not suitable to assemble the parts again , then to a decision . &quot;
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , parts and pieces come together again , even if the information is incomplete , especially when the brain is an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they are also involved in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to understand their audience better , what else would they have been unable to understand . however , the decision how to make all these parts again and make it a show as &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they went to a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a secure decision because they always could say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better choices , but I think things are wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it will also be called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ - or no question you must only shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will leave it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far , I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should listen to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis , to make better choices . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is to meet making decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data still pays off , make decisions to be an expert in which you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; at the end , it is not the data , but the risks where you will land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
