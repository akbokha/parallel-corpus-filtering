<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it was spectacular that the NSA illegally owned Telephones by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is another chapter, which should leave a permanent impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this case, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally delivered drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't liked the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became the symbol of the patterns of the government, Whistleblower to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"however, it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect this information, and if they can not protect the identity of the Much."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so, when the government headed by Risen, he did something that many brave reporters had already dealt with him: he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was therefore living with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government had dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and roughens to make statements, this could do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his understanding, concerned his telephone calls secretly,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like its e-mail data, financial and bankine information, its lending, and even travel tips with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and crafting."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead the judiciary has convicted more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government has taken a lot of work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a Whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we are setting the press coverage on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has more possibilities to address all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but as the technology of the government allowed to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"indeed, they can receive this from the moment in which they are contact, rather than in the descendant, in the testimony."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communications software that had not been written, as Risen had written his book, and it is essentially more secure than normal emails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source conversion system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's Internet, which was developed by us by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working, developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to an news page, like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents, or send documents, as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot find more information secretly, and many of the information they would like to request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments develop new spy technologies that are all endangered."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to ensure that not only supplier of technology, such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to kill abuse. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to know about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers, and from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alert to the contaminated water of Flint. or a WallStreet-Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[3 April 2016] [the]" Panama Papers "will reveal that rich and powerful] [the]" Panama Papers "have been hidden in tax haven.] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to give an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a rectangle of 11 million documents in the Panama's based law firm."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small view into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we will receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you address that? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in fact, we see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a bundled of brutal Syrian dictators Bashar al-Assad posterior companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous for the next publication, and the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems cry from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address it?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens, not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few, their assets to hide and swallow -- something we have been discussing and unveil."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax haven't work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"thus, one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations, that scandal to this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now it is not that there are no rich Americans, who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle, after which these tax haven't work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a lot of data from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more instances and examples that have connections in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to establish a company than for a library to get a library."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees to prevent school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed frauds to quench especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that everyone concerned us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself as African ministers, who wanted to bring money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really shocked us, that all up to a lawyer's lawyer did make suggestions as he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all prepositions. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course not anyone handed over money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer which commences to our uncovered investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top pole, involved in scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, established through corruption, tax curses, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to manage this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules in order to make this type of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very much as usual, as if we could do nothing against it; as if there is nothing ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed optimist I can certainly see that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"during the last few years, we have seen demonstrations to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been recorded at national registers at national level, who really stands behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentations, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as means to worry in the US and global for more transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who will furious, if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind different companies."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy that arise and say: "intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem, and deploy it through laws this kind of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the intransparency, which now makes this kind of tax curses, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after being completed my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my matters.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep today? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," I don't know. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just met him only! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know whether he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me saying: "I have an air matratze. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," uh, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I starred the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what have I broken down? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, at Zehenpointed at the door, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my view angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people who were sold in childhood than strangers were actually sold, actually friends who were waiting for it?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air matratze, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air matratze."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let us take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost plexed, my roommates, and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can do it, fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new Mitbewohner Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought how we could earn something. our apartment is included in a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and established as "air matratze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air matratze on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure, our cheese ham-Omelettes were completely different, because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we talked to our last guest, the door fell into the castle, starred Brian and me."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommates, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented the investors:" we would like to create a website, public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors is done when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite strange people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not do them.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in consolation, would be investing in a business which allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">"because we all have learned as children, strangers are dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can talk to things that can be good. we could designate."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust in design, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be so hard?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a cost-sample, which is the degree of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your left phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell phone of a stranger to the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of the people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">But who actually has Al Gores mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you proclaim on Twitter, that it dictates for the office of the President?"</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">Have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor could only be presented with his name, when he would tell whence he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine that they would have 150 findings, who say," "he can really hold very well ventilated cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-done feedback system strengthens trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">"it was hard for people to give negative subjects."</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest appearances, before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are about age and homes."</seg>
<seg id="178">"surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">"exciting, it will be exciting if you add the call to a person -- in our case by assessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stipening similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we knew that trust is dependent on how much one can be priced."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you say too little, like" Hi!, "you get no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells us too much, such as:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request also is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." tolle works of art in your apartment! I am doing with my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to create this degree at openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of text field to recommend the correct quantity text. we also give tips to which subjects you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the correct design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with which we had not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than prepared to put these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, business is very good for us."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">"there were guests who have been queting parties, or have devastated homes."</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these phone calls. I'm sorry if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"disappointment that you hear in the voice of the Ancfer, and will always be our biggest motivation to improve us further."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction had a problem of 123 millions, but had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence works, it may arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel that save one life even though they are not really familiar.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you ride a hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to feel solitary, they bring books."</seg>
<seg id="220">"you can stay one even longer, without charge the extra nights."</seg>
<seg id="221">I recommend it only! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay will run."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic retail here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now just call" "rental industry" "will not just be justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people lay a part of itself open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is to be compared with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would, however, if traveling would be a rich buffet from local import?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be when on every place you visit, a group there would have to wait a place there, to place a thorough and a pub-pentour quarter, one of whom you have never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn to cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make homes of reason for interpretations?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thought of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow ourselves to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and scotation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea, Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"residents are offered now. students who were looking for a stay,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were treated with people, whose children were out. they have been incubated programmes,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There were also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work exactly?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the correct design with the inventory of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeper pretente prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about every time when a red Mazda went over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design can't solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"suppressed or suppressed, a bravest, a terror?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">That is really true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so, the media people represent, that look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">They probably do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslims: it is great, you know."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double Espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealant-fitness-fanatician;</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to take this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, although the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old felt to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only passive the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought that he was in question, doubted and believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">Sometimes the beauty of the rhythm brings me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone is perceiving you, you understand completely, and what loves somehow?"</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in essence the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had taken place at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" Express News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircrafts in buildings, people sparked out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the television channel and heard,"... "Muslim"... "... in the name of Islam..."... "jihad...,..." "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"not only my country was attacked, but in Nu, the deeds of others turned into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West in the USA to move into a new town and begin with the construction studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove me -- as we were silent -- as deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment this night, in a new town in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," Be careful, "" be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Do not reject you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in the week -- the day when Muslims gather for the prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this very first Friday, the mosque could be a target."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were holding for Muslims, in the open air, and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There really were Brandanese on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who had attacked this country, attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I lost the rage of people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain continuously itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and join Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="323">They are talking about my church as of an tumor in the USA's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is considered as a whole and a benign tumor only stops under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital body."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, narrative and Olympionities. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of the United States be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe there will be a few parking spaces but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and show larger civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"during the radical process, it has found that he will start online. as the first one assumes that the person believes that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their role world when they recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology grounds on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you throw a look at it, it doesn't drive on what they are blown in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had previously decided to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit, with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her mind for iniquity in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"nothing inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumental orchestras by extremists who spoke about a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, they kept it to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight like the Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does normal Americans work?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies - show: if we fear that happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you submitted testing messages, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they would rather agree to Muslim attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood for Muslims had shifted upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this was three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as first but the toxic air of fear harm us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective blame, it is not only about to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was very promising in dental Faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the most sweet, most generous man, whom they knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him and he showed her his CV. she was blurned and said:</seg>

<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne's visit to her brother and wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the Sister of Yusor, Razan, who had been in the afternoon, as with an execution, after he posted utterances against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not a light decision, because it was about what America was going to do with our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in whom we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and moved my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw I left."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement to thank and welcomed our guests, because half of the meeting were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at this moment, I have collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">"these people were there, because they had courage and compassion, and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go for sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than that.</seg>

<seg id="404">"so, in no way, I am an exception."</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for Basters, is short to become a billionaire business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is possible in research institutions around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before the air-package set up in our social awareness, a autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in engaging room."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-corrosive structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry burdens, deal with turbulence and in general to react on natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility of an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus, a system autonom works, it must be collectively know where the mobile objects are in space."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localizing technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine which the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest image. e.g.," start "and" land. ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter;</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrvolgler, it is efficient in the advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most powerful whiskers, it can hover, and thus has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a flip side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailoring is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't matter in which location the optimal position can be improved and the performance can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which leads to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about machines with a thousand movable parts that are gathered together to injure you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"before decades, pilots were able to fly remote-controlled flight devices that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tailor."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only an eventful part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no capping, hinges and cross-rudes, no further actuators or checking surfaces, just a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although mechanically simple, it happens in the interior living very much so that it can fly stable, and moving around in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to bring it to flying, I must throw it exactly properly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood, to throw it exactly if all is looking, is low, so I'll show you a video filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in Genueliness, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambience in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the effective ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in space to move in all directions, no matter what direction it rotates or even as it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"much is shown in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves in clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, a bit wrong -- a engine or propeller falls out, the electronics or one battery -- can fly the machine if also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration explores synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units offers a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We recorded commercial Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and stalls it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit knows where it is in space, and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully, motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Broadway, Broadway wants to exercise a flying lamp-screen on Broadway."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, the wages in development and the rheinfo act lies."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creature, to form them in so spectacular manner."</seg>

<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was given into space-time feelings and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events first.</seg>
<seg id="476">"ago, 1.3 billion years ago was a multi-cell life on earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God arise with us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"some 25 years ago, a group of particularly musty -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech, decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliating black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most kept them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as a mad genius so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometry Gravitation Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo could significantly increase what the recognition performance improved enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collized black holes through the earth is through."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my father's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves of black holes and their symptoms such as ligo measurable signals for 23 years."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a crusk in the feelings of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"while passing the shaft, the room and its entire content will be stretched into a direction and in the other gesture."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses for relativity was often a really albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"defleeting and ducks, defleeing and ducks."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of September, for example, everyone was stretched by us during the wake of the waves and gested. the reproof of an average human being was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after the coma, followed by a 1. so, one explained the ligo-staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured at less than a thousandths of a nuclear career. that's grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs described the hunt after the waves:" the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are huge. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicist are inventive, and with the support of public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial covers, the size of your cell phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or map of things, by aware of that of several points coming light around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in the killing, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things to make you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">Child's face is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume, to close behind the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"number Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't work with them simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by doing changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">"at least, the measured frequencies are in the audible area."</seg>
<seg id="521">"thus, when we convert wave pattern to sound, we can literally speak the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has already been busy."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circling simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two body very quickly, you hear the same circus with an additional sound change. it sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu."</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget: [Surrender of sound] Someone, who knows what he must hear, knows this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar weight, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each other a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebnet a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practical or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massacred stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of iron, carbon, and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see where these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves pierce iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the pristion is covered by his own neighbor."</seg>
<seg id="541">Through gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen, we will never see, and from which we don't have any idea. things we can only discover that we listen."</seg>
<seg id="543">"indeed, Ligo found the first stop of things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as ligo they observe, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. black holes are so to speak the sour cream for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us to get a completely different view of the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">"AA: the challenge is now to be, as courageous as possible."</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">"for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine itself?"</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>

<seg id="561">Would I begin with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I was afraid, feared my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"keep my fear, keep talking, my social fear -- puff."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes, changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life to a unexpectedly. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for all" Schittens "for unexplained reasons."</seg>
<seg id="570">"as a result, it would be a waiter out of the south."</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my mutilage."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me whether I could play with her, when I was at the jump. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life setting in my family. from then I swear to play with them as soon as you do, I am saying, I say always Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect but I strive very.</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a stunning side effect: only recently I was fully understood that the "Yes" approach to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think things from, raise up to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create Creire TV. I smoke television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I have TV, in a big style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV-season I am responsible for this, 70 hours of program in the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that does not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million TV, four TV programs, four TV channels, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, simultaneously four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV-hours are shipments which I created yourself, and not only produced, so still obendable. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the camp and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, this is why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think if the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you all of you who work so hard to whether you're now a company, a country or a classroom, so that I tell you that I don't just talk about the computer, so that I say: I understand that there is no dream of dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"if I'm moving in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I introduced troops, I painted on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a dreaming of a high tone, one takes a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and stiffness, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing is that sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a Summon starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could always ride on it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take care of that, when I speak these sums, I speak writing that writing to me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong. it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- as I began working with TV production, when I started working and work to work and work, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you can't get different than size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, do not feel different than to strive to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summon.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workato be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it in question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to set a clear thing: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more the more superior, the more things are at the same time, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations I have."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this Summon?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revamped, exaggerated, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their Mama is an only working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells us:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson said," Bibs, I would like to go to Shonda. ""</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby equipment.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no longer. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15 hours-day, worked weekend, no remorse, not delegating, don't sleep, don't sleep, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just didn't have fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some like thinking:" hypocrate yourself, the author's author. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you are doing, you are working, you'll love to be a teacher, a mother, to be a teacher, a mother loves to be a teacher when you know the sums, and knows how to stop the sum when the Summon stops, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song listens to my heart, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-Kellnerin" represents me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to outside, late and she says:" "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to tell no more than two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my sums, and here all changes my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says:" "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and enjoy their sisters and we laugh so much and I'm very dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the summens, I can't do anything except."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, they exist no longer."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender voices, juniper pins and the song, in which it's about, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen leaves. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that doesn't immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sum, the work umming, the titanium dioxide, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I say you who I am, if I am managing my brain using the broadcasts and TV-hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not working specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums is the stream, which comes from the vitality."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the printing of history, which are experiencing the experiencing tasks, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to me God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It just is love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I am doing this for a fixed rule, so I can set myself down as workouts from any fault."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the Summon again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not ansatin so how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this agreement is painful, because what a person is working rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I am."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we shave around the garden, back and back, moving and round."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We cut down soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children tell me how to live, and the sum of the universe fulfils me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we stopped working with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let them always say Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you'll keep me naive for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">"well, you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you're not Rihanna or a Muppet-show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at the most of 15 minutes, until they fall into something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkaefer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teens daughter for 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more need it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">Anyone can open 15 minutes even at a Bad-Laune-Day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no steering."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children should make your bed."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are there!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my wellbeing, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I victories. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" is short for everything I got abandoned when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why do not get full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to be returning when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without any games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it meets me and my soul. she runs out to new ideas. I don't use it in full trains and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like this sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the Summon that Summon is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is snozzle, that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in handle. my brain is still working yet. my bonfires burn yet.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier are me and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land that I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sum, the more it makes this unusual, unning, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel like this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think things, I awaken for life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"it belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen found no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeries.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from a second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us, neurosurgery is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor that tries to improve the nerve functions through different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the best-known, the" Tiefenary stimulation. "it implanted a electrode deeply in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which laths satisfy with high-quality trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the moment I was a Senior Physician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-Hirn trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain-brain traumata is angled and inclined with skull-brain traumata.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one needs to reduce the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throw away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to increase cells from a tissue, comparable to a small children who are taken out of your family."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you must find the correct diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive it."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François succeeded."</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"maybe you still know from the Biological Lessons, that stem cells are inmature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small knots of brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell-population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">This blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellery cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the stage of the foetus, they ensure the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find it at higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brainmass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells that Jean François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark colour to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimplanted them at the deposition of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplant the same cells in the damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a couple of weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they vanish."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show, these small points are these small points. these are the cells we paint in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here, we couldn't stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Does these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injuries?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual skill task."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets of one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they achieved a stable skill level, we passed the motic Cortex of the motor-motions."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkey were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it was done with people, they recovering spontaneously at a certain degree, just like a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at a certain degree just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey reaches his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side, they see the monkey that was spontaneously repeated."</seg>
<seg id="874">He can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturmplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we found much more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream is still, they are implanted with people."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the resources to cure itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">"anyway, I am definitely."</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take to get to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you must perform this study using a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate treatment, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we make a big mistake, as of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging gevity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great Nachahmer in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely democratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"actually democracy is in us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared that the democratic process in the Eurogroup was unmistakable that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - do not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my admissible friends who would have repeatedly said that democracy would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I beg you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenous democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are darkened, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twins-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt of the debt, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the debt of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious, who would be anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one might produce the debt, and even all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, the US invested 3,4 trillion US dollars invested in all the wealth of wealth, such as industrial plants, machines, office building, schools, streets, tracks, equipment, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds a lot of money until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which was at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions; and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which do not disagree with the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not invest in which they could not invest in which they will not kill him that his son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally, the circumstances leads to it, that opus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely waste art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy now the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a company form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally got too many.</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the job value of the Athenian democracy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision-makers on the Athenian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms, but not only the right to freedom of expression, but it is important and crucial that they gave them right to political co-determination in questions of the public authorities."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy is not long kept --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which lightens very light, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-democratic democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"during the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizen and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on Magna Carta's values, which was ultimately a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came first, when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was transferred to politics, while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- a DemocratieFree Zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democratic democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an inherent fight between the two, and the economy gradually migrassed the policy."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are not so earlier than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">There is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is that one can be in the government today and still not in power because the power from politics into the economy is separated and the areas separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is in about as a herd of pirate who feeds on so sustainably the animals, of which they feeds, decimated that they were hungry at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the politics is so far cannibalized that it grows through the self-caused depression itself. the power of corporations increasing, the inequality is rising and the management of the corporations are anxious to invest the cash of their company."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the successful capitalism's successful" demos "increased from democracy, the higher the twins are, and the greater the waste of human labour and prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy again, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and the foreigner."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had an idea just 100 years ago and it didn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long economy and politics separate areas, the automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to combine the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics again, and we consider that we will recover the reunified area, otherwise we will end in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy which can be published in the movie" Matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not, whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements, which he will survive."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism are going through a Dystopia, similar to those in" "Star Trek", "in which machines are serving, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long conversations the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we are optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what need it, so how could it look like this" star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" "matrix" -similar dystopia? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in the practical implementation I want to tell you, in all things, some examples call."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: ask a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what man is working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"there is no distinction between those who belong companies, but not in it, and employees working there, but the company does not belong to where the company does not belong to capital and labour, and ultimately no empirivous twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy: please just imagine that our national currencies would have a free gay exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 biggest developing countries], in interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos "," in units of "cosmos" "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country, into a joint fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment is rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">"the problem was that, at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it."</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially in front of the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe you is at the same time liberals, in which they privileged persons preferably, and marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">"the answer depends on how we decide together, together."</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You agree to yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do that, the technological development is a massive decline in economic demand, which Larry Summers are known as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, this is why I am a libertful Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your presentation, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the supper of the Redner, you have told us very clearly what you keep from the view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the license of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most of the economy is, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratically-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain extent, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"-- Do you remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that's an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, How John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical for the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"so, China is now to take to do what the West has done in the 19th century, crawling with hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Finance ministers in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to self-commitment, and the continuing denial that a massive decline line through the eurozone went and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal to reveal this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to denounce the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you are trying to get a business system that is not viable, can be found in life through political will and authitarianism, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destroyed."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what transformation will you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change their setup.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Finance Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- harvesting...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister for Finance, or any Minister, who after 6 months in office, particularly in a so-called situation, claims that he did not have any mistakes, then it's a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to be subject to the extension of the cancellation of the cancellation of the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the monetary policy to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to put our government in case, only because they didn't want to deal with the conditions that ran through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they have passed a catastrophic programme for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika of the Bankers who imposed us this policy, was stressed:" that was a colossaler mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive door of conversations, you still seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone, opposite to someone who lives and loves."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the euro zone did not survive.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for making the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, it is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are located right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows, how many shows this evaluation."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted, where, after you have looked after a squadron, your brain asks:" where are there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows are shows like" Toddlers and tiaras "-- -- that was enough to tell you what turn off at this end."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry, on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to undergo" Toddlers and tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle output, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor badly, they simply do not delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something like that, therefore Roy Price will not risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he will hold a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses by a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode each of this shows, and puts it online, where she can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon gives free stuff for free, one is accessing, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are viewing this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are watched during watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"when you start the show, when you start the show, the parts you will skip or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"collect millions of data to decide on these dates, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom more about four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many to remember that show, because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 -- so on average, but not exactly what's Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company, another manager has plazed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly how Roy is he always searching for this super show, but he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of running a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so on the reviews they like shows, their course, shows them etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience: which shows them, which producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went into a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom via four senators, but a drama series over a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know that show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"two very competent, data sealed firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is it that lies?</seg>
<seg id="1084">"because the logic said somehow, that all should work with everything."</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if one collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years to statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">They are optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good television, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is a little frightening, because we live in a time in which we are able to meet more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the Multi-Health Systems company?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health System is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software. come in touch with this software you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is here in the US in prison and to dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show will be good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always creates the best results. this is not aware that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data will also be considered incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can be predicted due to data analysis explosions from flu, the worse way - by data analysis of the Google search."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was great news coverage. the success of the success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it was simply not working, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the journal Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these mistakes pouring data in decisions of life an -- at work, with legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- a territory, where some very smart people have unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some samples about the difference between data and non-successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"to take up this problem in its components, so you can analyse the individual parts; as second, you put the single parts together to deal with a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to take apart and relaunch."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help cut a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">"they are not suitable to assemble the parts again, then to a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, parts and pieces come together again, even if the information is incomplete, especially when the brain is an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they are also involved in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to understand their audience better, what else would they have been unable to understand. however, the decision how to make all these parts again and make it a show as" House of Cards "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they went to a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas then they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they always could say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better choices, but I think things are wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It will also be called "Magic 8 Ball". it's amazing. for decisions using a j- or no question you must only shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will leave it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should listen to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis, to make better choices."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is to meet making decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data still pays off, make decisions to be an expert in which you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"at the end, it is not the data, but the risks where you will land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
