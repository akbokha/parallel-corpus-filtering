&quot; Munich , 1856 : four maps that change your eyes to the city &quot;
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where people are supposed to meet young people today .
&quot; a tomb , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small hus@@ band@@ men domin@@ ates the first reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch encour@@ ages exciting stories to days .
it annoying if maps are not currently available .
&quot; this knows , everyone who had been very exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historic maps of the digital Bayern @-@ Atl@@ ases , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - yet very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
&quot; then , in the 19th century , the towns and municipalities have changed since the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; the digital Bavaria Atlas is a tile @-@ carpet , which is not the same as such . &quot;
&quot; in the great overview card , maps and communities for more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ positioning She@@ ets . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian Sur@@ vey@@ ing Administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first survey@@ ing Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; in the spring of 1800 , the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the second coalition of war with Austria . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes . &quot;
&quot; finally , when the French troops invaded the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 , it was the current neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project ahead , the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and hence the Bay@@ erische Sur@@ vey@@ ing Management . &quot;
the pre @-@ positioning sheet for Munich is dating back to 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; compared to early / today , the state capital is the most impressive . &quot;
&quot; the city has expanded in all directions , and has grown together . &quot;
&quot; an example of this is a sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after creating the map , i.e. 1877 , in the Munich district . &quot;
today he is in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of the refugee camps are concentrated along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing as a fields - at the first glance : in the inside of zo@@ oming appears a small part map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots are not present there today no farmers anymore - but small gar@@ dener in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is drawn to the north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 place of the October Festival , was actually a meadow , and no concrete dest@@ iny in the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the pre @-@ positioning sheet in the area of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads only the street names &quot; at guest dough &quot; or from the height &quot; At the fan &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße they once bul@@ lied with men once . &quot;
there was 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &quot; At the Au@@ er Lü@@ th .
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the facility - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the Cha@@ ins of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has signed the personnel to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; first place for 280 patients was first place , later extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ Institution in Hair in 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
&quot; the Order took the building complex in 1920 , and walked into a youth home with training . &quot;
&quot; located west is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses in the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , one built the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in an architectural appeal to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance , which was destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 , as &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ branch office called &quot; Kauf@@ inger lane . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
&quot; the Allied bombs broke out in December 1944 , many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a tomb in the Middle Ages , stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days work on and on April 5 , 2017 , will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn trunk line . &quot;
the old Munich map displays the old Munich map with the air picture of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Council published travel funds for Missouri
&quot; the National Association to promote Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people , due to the discri@@ min@@ ating politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri , which shall come into force by August 28 , 2017 , urges af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a number of frag@@ ility , racial @-@ based presence in the entire state , and here , &quot; says it is in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Missouri Law of Missouri , which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution of the state , and the prosec@@ utions of the State , the NA@@ AC@@ P , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of civil rights , human beings . &quot;
&quot; they are killed or killed because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Missouri NA@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incid@@ ents such as rac@@ ist betra@@ yal against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and by the police of Missouri , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also reports on a recent report by the Office of the Office of Missouri , which is shown that black motor@@ ists will be more common than white in the state of 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and informed about their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people must be willing to bring you to me , or the relatives know that they are travelling through the state . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 Hass@@ elt , after the latest numbers from the hate @-@ breaking report of the FBI , which accounts for the state in terms of the number of such injuries on the 16th ranking of the country . &quot;
the travel agent is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company because of residential or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued a travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the States In@@ mig@@ rant authorities agreed to ins@@ ure people for mig@@ rant workers , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; travel@@ og@@ ues are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have the measure of reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA . &quot;
turn@@ key project is elementary
the Fis@@ b@@ acher Wei@@ den@@ aun Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU Bundestag member Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have been creating a picture on the spot .
representatives of the fishing village of Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two delegates together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EPs .
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into his farm , where he supplies 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 mil@@ k@@ cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens supplies and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is the alternative way of aging for the milk of his cows , such as Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; at the table of the Feri@@ h@@ ist , exclusively regional . &quot;
&quot; as he also has BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach , he described the turn@@ key project as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot; &quot;
I can not win a steep land on that way .
&quot; the green@@ ery care for a lot of work , much to be edited with the sense sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann emphas@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ ranean operation and rep@@ aid these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not lead to bio operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the dec@@ imal project and is glad about the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers have to be supported . &quot;
&quot; one hope , that the view of the surfaces could still be carried out for a while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot;
the farmers are often in the cr@@ iti@@ que of criticism
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the open area amounts to 40 hectares , which can not be applied until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; the total cost of 71 500 Euros was funded by the total cost of 71 million , a quarter of the municipality of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers had to spend 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stated . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do have a really good job , without farmers and land women don &apos;t go . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White , the best food was produced here . &quot;
the state of land@@ sc@@ ans ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of f@@ ences .
the goal of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald is the dis@@ closure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
pre@@ condition is the presence of one of the p@@ p@@ r signed conveyor .
&quot; in addition , the in@@ adequate area may not be dra@@ stic ( hanging over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by means of view . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ b@@ acher Wei@@ gh@@ aun@@ t Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots would like to build up close to 16 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the display area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the corresponding costs are more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
&quot; the saf@@ est character of a regime change is , when they start to attack the statues . &quot;
&quot; Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the supply of Saddam Hussein &apos;s going down on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , did not know what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a heated battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN about the proposal of the President to dra@@ stic immigration in the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have gel@@ ding him if he had done it .
&quot; but he touched their importance , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom which light@@ ens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller lies true , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the asc@@ ending words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the arms of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ds , your poor , / your poor gri@@ ds to breathe freely , and the ending waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh garbage &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller was not committed to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict is part of a wider political and cultural con@@ frontation : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after her death on the base - knew very good that they were doing a highly political action .
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republican @-@ Rep@@ ublic@@ ism , portra@@ ying the feminine representation of the freedom of freedom . &quot;
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and they themselves have a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and exactly as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to go back from the right wing this long time . &quot;
&quot; the great write @-@ like Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty finally invite the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it should carry out the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
&quot; rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh went on something here . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is quite and a question of perception .
&quot; the great great fact of Lazarus was there to see them as they saw from the exhausted , el@@ eventh , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , the world is going to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; her statue speaks to them the words of hope , and of the welcome you need to hear . &quot;
&quot; and that is , of course , not to recognize the perspective , Miller and Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but hate the hatred , which is the only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle remembers a time when only two sh@@ all@@ ots of the UK were part of the UK
&quot; the power director of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of World Championships &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , starting Friday . &quot;
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special was developed &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue it until we &apos;ll find out . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on road corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ p@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah during the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ dh Doyle &apos;s team was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
her cap@@ tains speech was unbelievable . &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the li@@ ili@@ ie , of course , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner that will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle says that it is &quot; unbelie@@ v@@ ably &quot; is that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots in the British team are .
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ distance for@@ erun@@ ners Mu@@ ir sets out five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1,500 m , is another b@@ otte , which one should watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anniversary Games . &quot;
Doyle remembers their first world championships as the only other band in the Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team cap@@ tures says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots have not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be team cap@@ tains in it lies that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as an established athl@@ ete , athletes who want to rise to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what is related to my speech as cap@@ tains ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; so , it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete there , and it simply will be so great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking the critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public ministry when you cannot cover the heating of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from inner policy up to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he ch@@ imp@@ lied with the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t leave his critics to silence .
&quot; for the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and dum@@ b , as sheep are led to the battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union promised him , therefore , at the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the staff of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as a free@@ zeout , and the online comment was full of counter@@ action with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary H@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of its state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
&quot; he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters , to deb@@ ating his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons that come on the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially referred to and by employees that are paid with public tax @-@ dollar - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse rescu@@ ed the actions of the Governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing further than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ t or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ass@@ hop@@ ed people , which vibr@@ ate online . &quot;
the Post spoke with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the parish cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
&quot; attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ ented , but she asked for Hass@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; I said , cour@@ te@@ ous that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate breaking and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take on the same topic , then they are accepted by some rather than so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the employees of the Govern@@ ors called &quot; concentrated spam assault &quot; would probably call others &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic , or delete a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in early days when you have done the same , that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guiding and burn , and to silence them . &quot;
but exactly that happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servants that critic@@ ises that he imp@@ lied the Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the first am@@ end@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Before ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers increased between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters to his lead . &quot;
&quot; and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ition@@ ing that critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t leave her to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , opinion of opinion , and discounts are on the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty , in the next three days , hope to hope the Renaissance Club in East lot@@ hi@@ an the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the final round in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links until he lost against Paul E@@ ales in the past year , and acts as a tournament message in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reached his fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best page , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job as he put this place .
he is a eager supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it was taken in the year after I had won it out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the action on home . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also felt this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it happened .
&quot; with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ulty . &quot;
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six vill@@ i on the field which others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
less people have died in the past two decades due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
&quot; at this outcome , scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come into a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases were due to passive smoking , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , he went up to this topic in 1994 . &quot;
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ connections prove themselves as very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and are reason@@ ably happening in time , &quot; says the ladder of the court Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of household connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected because in the underground there is much mo@@ ist , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which always ob@@ struc@@ ted the construction work , represents a huge problem for the part of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and bul@@ lock is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , it uses no cooker . &quot;
it even uses a pot .
&quot; in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the co@@ iled Kn@@ olle is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swallowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - it has no furniture , where they also carry out their daily work , for example clothes with dim water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of her husband &apos;s wife , you have not assigned any fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work is dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody likes it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare view into the daily life of the Hochland von Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that touched independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which includes control over the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal wat@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially split in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea was the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with around 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo trees , and converted from corrugated plates that were converted by rust in various gel@@ b@@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only a few decades of Indonesia have done their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an inherited a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and suggests her vibrant , hand woven tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; before , we only had leaves to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is of Indonesia &apos;s poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high territory in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed in the value of 3.1 billion dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua provides wood resources worth US $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these rich@@ ness , however , are a source of affliction for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves its initial presence . &quot;
&quot; a report from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military occupation and units between 1998 and 2004 , paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
par@@ u@@ an demands for larger autonomy this golden g@@ ans and will be treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped since 1969 from the Indonesian military , tortured and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; mass killed in Pap@@ u@@ as stem cell in the 1970 @-@ 1970s , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers last year alone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will say &quot; &quot; it is written in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities in the previous year are included , such as un@@ healthy exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incid@@ ents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have intensi@@ fied , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a state of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing , since Muslim economies of the popul@@ ous islands are Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ e@@ ins sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado served a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting for here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has cost the local Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market .
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crowds and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke about ine@@ qualities and legal injuries in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann @-@ secured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little and today the loc@@ als feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that righteousness is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children said to them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took part in their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued , and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was struck so difficult that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things were escal@@ ating on the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field before the local police station and the Military Command Center to call justice . &quot;
&quot; they carried out crushed fighters , and conducted the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle , and a bird @-@ cat@@ chy - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm . &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators started to@@ wing stones in police and military posts .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers sent a command to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TIM@@ E , which has not released the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the amount to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E at the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; kay@@ aking still doesn &apos;t know who was fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired &quot; , &quot; he adds . &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times so his cousin who was witness of the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just carries a name , the TIM@@ E was in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him .
&quot; the Che@@ es@@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ orters said that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; &quot; because it would be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ers were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i kept a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he vo@@ wed sympath@@ ies for the families of victims , and gay , to tackle the historical problems in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case is immediately solved , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Secretary of Security Wir@@ anto said that it was a foreign mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the talking began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to go these bre@@ aches , but there are processes that need to be run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he did not plan any plans in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
&quot; instead , everything is governed by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto was accused of accused of crimes against humanity by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were already laid in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
&quot; in the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims , such claims were contrary to influenza . &quot;
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sh@@ ries have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between the residents and the manager of a building , which refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ v , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
ra@@ ining vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers had cast stones on officers , which re@@ acted to them by removing warning shots . &quot;
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed a killed .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness , as the last one was delivered here quickly , the TIM@@ E . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai always was a ru@@ ined stove for the Indonesian government .
&quot; lack of meaningful development strengthens the in@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by removing spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of the Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some will never fall again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als . &quot;
bread is just as range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , which can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot;
&quot; most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a spent only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived at the Nab@@ ire Airport in larger numbers since the opening of new air routes . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which exist in the region , go to the better educated and wealthy migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on coverage of international media will be sc@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attemp@@ ting to report from Indonesia un@@ pret@@ ti@@ est eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa ref@@ us@@ al to a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six @-@ Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ots and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir proved the accus@@ ations of the group , and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people in the place want more foreign governments to know this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura left their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they might not agree not again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good int@@ entions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe . &quot;
&quot; he hopes that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a common military , is in ar@@ ming heating and health services . &quot;
&quot; g@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , has to consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they only want righteousness , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai pl@@ uss@@ ation resulted in a final symbolic act of interest : the bodies of a victim was buried on a terrain just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that there may never be righteousness to them , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with direct head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
&quot; a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest neighbor@@ hoods in Dubai in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants , out of the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps out by the high @-@ house only two years ago by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we have stood at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
&quot; we burned down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished the building .
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accomod@@ ations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used for safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ quality hospitals in all over the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 , revealed that the largest part of the damage from the covering , the outer cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates used to insulation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire of fire , with which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis court ( IT@@ F ) has passed with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; during the Ho @-@ Chi Minh City meeting , the meeting was supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single and only two @-@ thirds by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; the often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classic remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries agreed to reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; we will continue to work , to improve the values . &quot;
&quot; not only for the vote , after many objec@@ tions before the proposal passed , the final in a neutral place was added . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the first round .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs of the promot@@ ers , requirements in training places etc. are facil@@ itated and the players will have to complete their official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; over 1 of 5 US travelers , prohibited objects into the plane , finds a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among air passengers showed that over 20 percent consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously prohibited items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration passed , among them at least 6 per cent who entered the plane , while they accid@@ entally prohibited knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; fewer than 1 per cent claimed they had been dis@@ astro@@ us that they have jour@@ ne@@ yed with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a Jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather desp@@ ise the rules . &quot;
&quot; of those surveyed said that they have attempted to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately to@@ wed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent agreed to wi@@ pe out items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents have also confirmed that they were forbidden to forbidden drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have questioned travelers throughout the country to find out how many accid@@ entally Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware had brought out how many accid@@ ental sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware had done and how many things were intenti@@ onally done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who were at most sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware - wi@@ ped or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by safety , those who were most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company indicates that T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confused . &quot;
&quot; people are often uncertain , which liquids they may take away , or how much of it . &quot;
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the biggest crowd of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items prohibited . &quot;
&quot; a time for the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k it doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are happy with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; until now , he has under@@ estimated that a part of the clients has already withdrawn their un@@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the constantly triumph@@ ant numbers , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has betra@@ yed one another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number , the cancellation of the new mass market Model 3 for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k was frequently advert@@ ised with the more than 500,000 orders for the new car , whose extradition is straight forward . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is a : of the total 5@@ 18.000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 has already been withdrawn again . &quot;
critics always noted that it &apos;s only about non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) . &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 of such un@@ binding reservations made available in a telephone conference with analysts at present . &quot;
&quot; however , if cancelled up to 12 per cent of all orders to date , the Tesla boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; 2018 - all models have to be combined - 500.000 , 2020 , a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1,800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; will be ordered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new , never in practice tested production lines without any longer inter@@ ru@@ ptions with maximum load capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but , however , it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the Un@@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tesla . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not hin@@ der satisfied customers in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA Group CEO P@@ ru@@ itt draws for reducing emissions due to the execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a
&quot; a day after he had been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , had delayed his earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency turned to the needs of public environmental authorities as far as former administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeals .
&quot; it is about a time limit , which ran on 1 October for States to keep the standards of 2015 for under@@ lined o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would be able to start accept@@ ing a year in order to study more time to study the plan and to hin@@ der itself in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of demanding environmental legislation . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block regulations or delayed the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the youngest legal turn for the cross @-@ section regulatory agenda agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA car@@ et@@ akers have exceeded his authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in a report published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ er at o@@ zone standards simply proposed the read@@ iness of the EPA to co @-@ operation with the countries by the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards reinforced . &quot;
&quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA often has kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting for the implementation of consolidation groups and others , said P@@ ru@@ itt , who promised the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take fri@@ est seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; however , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; evidence for delay and all other legal entities provided to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are pushing onto a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; in the last month of approval , the bill should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States , who had attempted the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - after our Kl@@ agen - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , which flows directly from the smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;

Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the church is invited to the old cemetery @-@ A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. to a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its id@@ yl@@ lic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique style . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ischer Rundfunk in the first time : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with that of the parish church at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the word document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain , besides the former parish church , a beautiful courtyard , belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , who is still to recognize today in the village of Tum@@ our , the &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 exposed to these history areas .
the pat@@ ron@@ ym right arose from the early medieval mon@@ k law .
&quot; one Lord , who built a church , retired , and occupied with a priest , continued to inherit the owner of this church , and could also inherit these y@@ enk@@ ir@@ che . &quot;
this was the right to send a priest or bishop a new priest .
three alt@@ ars there were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Big@@ ger of the Two Dec@@ or@@ st on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell was first published in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window frames were stolen and the bell ro@@ pes were stolen .
the roof was dense .
&quot; in 1796 , French troops arrived in the vicinity of the church . &quot;
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church bells and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to be destroyed in 1809 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead in horns . &quot;
in 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the stor@@ er@@ tower left .
&quot; in the new Year of the Year of 1834 , a storm sun@@ k the cherries and half collapsed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was canc@@ eled . &quot;
only the existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ ut@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ IN care of the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ ual pension@@ ers &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant . &quot;
&quot; as organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Kepler School in Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with Word contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
near Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the programme starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
&quot; to the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk will be held in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , the organis@@ ers provide the fantastic views . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters of the acquisition of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is important for tum@@ ours and horns . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organizer Walter Mart@@ ini , the friends and convey@@ er tum@@ ors feel particularly committed . &quot;
Verein wants to test permission from Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ dern
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim are we@@ aken &quot; does not see legal requirement for construction , and has therefore turned to the land council . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; club we@@ bin@@ ds , &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ded ( CDU ) invited his approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , N@@ ette could no wind turbines have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only on the town border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal existed a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within the concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , however , concentration zone causes the concentration of wind power consumption for the rest of the city area . &quot;
such zones are to prevent a &quot; deteri@@ oration &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided by a change in the area for a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the district government in Düsseldorf was not approved because of a formation . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the auth@@ oriz@@ ations of the approval is modest , and therefore , Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , said , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens . &quot;
&quot; current state of things : the city council has decided in front of the summer break , at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval of the district government is still standing . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of an approval for the construction of wind energy systems plan@@ ation is excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the view .
&quot; the corresponding writings have entered the circle fourth since last week , &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to check the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the administration of the administrative court , the circle on Thursday would not be responsible for the reas@@ oning of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high winds . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company has been involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen has been involved , P@@ eigh@@ ties with the owner of about 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of four wind turbines , electricity demand is to be covered by around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to roughly one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ grown households . &quot;
the NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; in the last summer , Vier@@ sen Municipal coun@@ cill@@ or green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ nich near Aachen , as well as participating in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor together : woman dies at horri@@ ble accident

the state road remained locked over hours .
&quot; according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich passed away with her passenger car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bathroom Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping center in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on the 8th and 9th of September to attract the inhabitants of the shopping spre@@ e in downtown .
&quot; as the chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , the &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; will sensiti@@ ze the customers that offers its own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training plans . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite for the &quot; mit@@ ter@@ night shopping &quot; shop . &quot;
this action is not only in the residents of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag that refer to the stock weekend , as Christian König . &quot;
city administration and commercial organisation cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the commercial club and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive Center . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to Brun@@ n@@ en@@ fest , with sell on Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ ders and hosts to move it to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the ren@@ unci@@ ation on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential customers should be new or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include tourist guests and tourists .
but many natives have also lost the city center when shopping was lost .
&quot; at the end , all to contribute to revi@@ ve the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; in the spring , King had spoken in the spring with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Centers in Mü@@ hl@@ hausen , shared with that the third &quot; &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time five Thuring@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , So@@ v@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should be entitled &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and its significance for the community of our cities , &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK , and with many partners , will also make clear that every citizen can influence his own @-@ right environment itself . &quot;

&quot; among the dead , it was employees of the school . &quot;
as un@@ lucky cause the authorities suspected work on a gas line .
&quot; during the holiday season , few people took place in the Min@@ ne@@ haha Academy . &quot;
tr@@ ump suspension after deduc@@ ted tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump carried out on a phone with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned boundary . &quot;
&quot; the US president imp@@ lied him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to that , he said to him , &quot; This can &apos;t you tell the press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and gay to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first stop with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an attack sharing .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia were ridic@@ ulous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which by the government Obama would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on refugees from refugees to the USA . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after being said to Mr. Turn@@ halle , &quot; this is the un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a niche suit - took a long train to his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the st@@ icking in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; cry to the silence , when a young black man was torn down by passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one night . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop has thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them in the audience were very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civil law@@ makers come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey , were syn@@ dic@@ ated from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody ever was indicted for murder .
&quot; it is truly in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no one person was arrested , even though we know them in our congregations , though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps with the organisation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spots on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of the state of Georgia and a living citizen .
for him it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that was never corrected .
&quot; we want to prosec@@ uting the prosecution , we want the end , we want the healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get righteousness , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to the healing and reconciliation , until we receive righteousness . &quot;
a judicial medi@@ ator puts a towel about the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files that were received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Monroe and the surrounding villages in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody ever was charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot since decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in all the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time in the summer battle for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; at the same time as the election , according to the FBI &apos;s choice , Roger Mal@@ com faces a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly due to a woman . &quot;
Bro@@ oks said that it was rum@@ our of the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore is not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they were then turned away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b were converted into the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison that has prepared and arranged the mor@@ de , conclu@@ des from an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in murder , dis@@ counted evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks makes it more fun .
&quot; it was a voting right massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black men in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; its representation is vivid , att@@ acking and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he does not exist in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to look , and yet more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confron@@ ted with his hem@@ at@@ ern@@ ity in us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me , or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - entered into a room and l@@ ur@@ ted when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ ode@@ gh is here Gre@@ et co @-@ director .
&quot; he played the role of chef @-@ Cl@@ an@@ co member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room proven actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester is crying and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ asted away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a answered the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud voice .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ki@@ dy . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ched , one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly , the energy in the room , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this correctly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed persons . &quot;
the scene will begin once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a tells the N word , it says it sharp and with a re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is cry , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with a funeral dress , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors , and leads to Billi@@ e Holidays , &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it caught a group of about four dozen viewers and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
&quot; a pair has come from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the road . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced for almost eight hours of Georgia , when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point , the kill@@ ings have stayed an Ane@@ cd@@ ote , but now , when you find on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels wi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to inspec@@ t the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cks at their heads , register the counter@@ feit blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ky a little boy , when he wants to remind of it . &quot;
&quot; after some minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly it &apos;s over . &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x and wi@@ pe her tears .
&quot; by Brad@@ sha@@ w , Mar@@ ode@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the Cl@@ an member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ con@@ a h@@ ugs two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of the performance finally breaks with it . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this out of one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sit together with the actors for dinner together . &quot;
&quot; a white couple from Atlanta excited about the follow @-@ up with a black pair , which they had just met . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski started to find words , which has left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you look and do that , because it looks like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what that really does with me does believe me that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; added , &quot; &quot; today , the only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone holds Bro@@ oks Hof on his table , he eats and remembered the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; the evidence is inspiring , because she describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; id@@ ol@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sits on a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production of gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop . &quot;
&quot; the script platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ atter@@ ned road corner with the wall left and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine le@@ thal was pos@@ ing as a Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
cap@@ tiv@@ ated oil thread remin@@ ded of cast@@ ors of cast@@ ors - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rh@@ en@@ vy - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke L@@ oll@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since then , Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , they have been co@@ iled in Hollywood man@@ ier a body in the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious in Hagen that surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weights .
brutal the scene when he proposes Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) also has to believe . &quot;
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who de@@ hum@@ bled himself modest and bent his hands for the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; big appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which shows up for the first time on stage - in view of the big heat again in soft leisure clothing . &quot;
the gig was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ent flute concert in 2013 , and five years later , in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleased about that .
&quot; one not@@ ices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also a understanding of its visibility . &quot;
I prefer a positive res@@ ume .
Max quantity works as volunteers
they work with several sites in their volunte@@ ering year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once in the week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open all day at school .
how are your experiences there@@ with ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , or a late @-@ day volunteer . &quot;
how does it come from ?
quantity : I made high school .
&quot; and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; I recognized for myself , that it &apos;s a false thing for me and I want to do something else with people . &quot;
and then I asked me what do you do .
&quot; a social year there is a social year , there &apos;s a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social industry .
&quot; I will study dual study , do probably do a social worker education and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not unusual during the volunte@@ ering to have several different uses ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where to make his FS@@ J .

I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
differently than in civil engineering ?
&quot; amount : well , here it &apos;s not about to ex@@ ert ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; it always has other people in front of the head , each of which have a completely different story behind . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a youth which has been picked up out of the family - you always have to enter into action . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no need of contact ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; a lot of love , a lot of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life . &quot;

EPA returns to the delay of the smo@@ g rule following complaints around
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delayed a regulation of the government of Obama , of which the states are obliged to kill the Smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was one day after 15 States accused the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone Rules 2015 , &quot; and said they show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the int@@ ent of the EPA , the o@@ zone regulations - in which part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions are to be fixed to consoli@@ date where entries must be taken to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ wind a wide range of environment , former president Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ back of the Democrats and protection groups that are concerned about the effects of bigger emissions to public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and increases the respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
Mun@@ der@@ at wants to shared common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : when two counter@@ voices decides the community of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ds decided to set up a joint space in the future hospital . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic part was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last , until the date of the church community of the county is owned , there is no planning evidence for that of private investor to more secure project . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living area - around 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with a 70 square metres floor area for a special price available . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the community coun@@ ters pending , such a common room will not be fore@@ seen as the meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ously living room , but open into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by providing funds for the current budget has already been decided in the past fall , by funding . &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ up looks to sign@@ alize the investor that you don &apos;t want to throw away from the legs in this regard , that , in this regard , it is due to artic@@ ulated - as well as for the ambient roof - as well as the pace @-@ level and construction of economic power - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; un@@ necessarily , not only Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanimously he happens the panel .
not as easy as it goes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of its own buildings , with which you do not get it right now , it is said : &quot; I do so hard to do so . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger talks to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal stake .
it looks behind a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y on assets or foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no supply , but will receive a real , in @-@ field @-@ market counter@@ feit market , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers proposal to con@@ serve the orders of orders , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; for example , it remains with two objects in the original program that summar@@ ises Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step down to close a giant in our infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six test stations , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his crew . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
that was last not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in power in the first official match of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of both German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans into their sp@@ ell .
&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , the German football League ( DF@@ L ) shared on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the Har@@ z of Star , &quot;
&quot; in the Har@@ z , the nationwide &quot; star trail &quot; will be created . &quot;
this is planning the Verein Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet road in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star trail &quot; will be to meet the information needs of many har@@ p@@ iers .
&quot; it offers binding nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set up along the planned route boards and inform about stars and star images .
&quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the association is planning to reach &quot; &quot; well @-@ reach installations in five to six places &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; en@@ quiry into St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards are to be completed by the Internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of a good mobile network reception . &quot;
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star@@ path train should be extended by train .
&quot; at the star@@ path , the viewer learned a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the club . &quot;
&quot; they also learned , why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although he is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constellation is a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany . &quot;
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany according to the federal national park .
&quot; often , from there , the milk road and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy has clearly seen with the naked eye . &quot;
&quot; in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there has been something similar to the planet@@ arium initiative since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary way leads up to the Hain@@ berg and to the ob@@ servatory , as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( Community Equ@@ ines ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the St@@ amps with the individual Plan@@ ets - including the d@@ warf @-@ planned P@@ lu@@ to on the end point - are exactly at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ ank so on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 75 meters from the sun . &quot;
the planet &apos;s total distance amounts to a good four kilometres .
&quot; during the light of sun up to P@@ lu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to St@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to . &quot;
so pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in space .
the march to the next fi@@ xation was last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the thr@@ illing boxing contest in the near future among 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ owned World Bo@@ xing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , down the corridor down to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ suspension Champion . &quot;
&quot; according to Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through one @-@ of @-@ the decision on the former four @-@ divisions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters were members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Garcia put forth his right hand and said , &quot; How are you doing , Champion ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his gir@@ dle against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 : 00 PM EST .
&quot; when the couple was pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters will be the &quot; perfect size . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remin@@ ded Garcia . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come on Ligh@@ tweight Her@@ bs .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound debut this year in order to make a date in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell , following their lightweight @-@ weight battle campaign in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans wondered after him , &quot; &quot; said Garcia and pushed forward later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Garcia , Garcia , Garcia was called Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a tremendous fighter , &quot; and he may be able to participate in his Saturday fight . &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he was thinking the three @-@ fighting champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side . I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ Off .
&quot; Garcia has said that the focus is to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the moment@@ um , which was built for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the battle that needs to be performed .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; said Garcia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four last after ty@@ re plat@@ ters
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the connection of the market , presumably after a ty@@ re plat@@ ter , lost control of its vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger car hur@@ ried to the right to the vill@@ ain , where he turned over and then lay on the roof in the grave . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first power supply by the rescue service , the A7 towards the north for about an hour was locked , then the traffic on the left lane was passed to the accident site . &quot;
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 at the end of the season open@@ er , Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optim@@ isation of def@@ enses with Au@@ e points takes place . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , they would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must still watch in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge , the thres@@ hing chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a fool after a freedom of freedom , the Fort@@ unas also want to inv@@ ade more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be so no longer next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also comes to the experience in preparation with the three chain , than with the quad@@ ran@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we are acting in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we &apos;ve just got in the turning chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well . &quot; &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; requirement is , but that we are still better harmon@@ ise and we do not afford so many kinds of playing . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , if you decide to speak after a dis@@ concer@@ ted start , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could certainly be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are standing on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season open@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of that , his trainer wanted nothing to know . &quot;
&quot; the start in the season I was only after six to eight games &quot; , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , who would not speak of a advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony had to be canc@@ eled due to a non @-@ weather . &quot;
&quot; now they can begin the season quasi with a home play , &quot; &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even have something fresh , because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a rise in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Internal Defense of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhineland will go to the Rhineland as easier Favor@@ it on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is stup@@ idity , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance is only a positive defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2 . Bundesliga , which one needs to beat from the out@@ set , &quot; says Fort@@ unas Chef . &quot;
&quot; arro@@ gant , arro@@ gant , and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Fun@@ kel wants to experience his player on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
&quot; the latest findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Car@@ ri@@ cul@@ in@@ al@@ et ) has started with the implementation of tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , you should be more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration authority ( migration sales ) were crit@@ ici@@ zed by lack of the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ational sales sent 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency affir@@ med that the person might be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old .
tests are carried out only in cases where the person is asked in question .
&quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly resistant to recent months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high percentage of cases where the person has been assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers has been lied to over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there was 4@@ 42 cases that we propose that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet , the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly , that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , being made at X @-@ rays of white teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which then were analyzed by dent@@ ures and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had the reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
&quot; to assess the biological age in this way , is very uncertain . &quot;
&quot; if we cannot be sure we should not do so , as if we could &quot; , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk , a child is in@@ correct as adult , is minimal . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in this case , if the person is less than 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very well in the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction manager at the department of road and traffic in the gover@@ ning department of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work at the same time began working on all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the construction is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is clothed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in the year 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , she has come into the years now . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were erected in 1939 , twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on Wednesday morning , a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called br@@ ück@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; this is a random version , which is also used as a factory road . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the southern part of the bridge is expected to be 2.@@ 20 metres wide . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way out .
&quot; the special thing is that there are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tips has the wiring of cables through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a glass fibre cable , which many companies are connected there . &quot;
the indigenous people were informed about the project in advance of the plans .
&quot; furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
for bridges between the building farm and the collectors in direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg is the traffic over@@ lap due to a traffic light .
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s main entrance , the road in the area of the bridge on the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; was closed . &quot;
&quot; the costs for the three bridge units are 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
it is financed by the country .
Af@@ ol@@ stein in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it &apos;s not so common that parties move to a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the C@@ ret@@ um Vol@@ can@@ arian parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on that day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell to the &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start , like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice president of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already in front of the event at the beginning of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ eng@@ ths , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel stays colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city pic@@ nic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; is planned on the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ platz , but is now on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus just before the eyes of those who come to the African event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that provides itself .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the relevant organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , among them a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him with . &quot;
&quot; the police has taken many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence of all the railway station , just a few metres from the venue . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported about the African volcanic cubes in order to get such an event and get the surcharge .
&quot; the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there is not enough parking spaces . &quot;
&quot; so , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says , &quot; This is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : at about 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various Red@@ ner , among them the Rhineland @-@ p@@ fal@@ z@@ ic Af@@ D leader Uwe boy . &quot;
&quot; in the hall , about 200 listen@@ ers , which are waiting for the top @-@ edge of the federal election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice president of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch have kept their speech@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officers had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than one hour takes the African event , the guests on the pitch have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can leave off - no special incid@@ ents .

&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; , &quot; or &apos; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &apos; meets a classic German training with roots in the brass music . &quot;
&quot; both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and pri@@ ze@@ winners of numerous international competitions , and have held Sol@@ op@@ os@@ itions in European &apos;s history . &quot;
this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the lust , not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also to merge the limits of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like the two such as in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ lau@@ re@@ ate N@@ ils W@@ itt , mix classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating complete art work . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed in this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ itt wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with their special acou@@ st@@ ics is conscious of the concert with included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and they will eat it until the end of her life . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart completely openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood @-@ stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who ultimately went bitter .
&quot; in spite of all this , the brunette student portra@@ yed opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with love that I &apos;ve had . &quot;
or do you think you have played it ?
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten said that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived with du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ der me .
I just liked it not to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , I suffered &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but at school time , as she felt like a Bu@@ b dress : &quot; not all the girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , I told me the children I would look like a Bu@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
now look back and think myself : &apos; girls &apos; be proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; especially the public , they don &apos;t like to love her love life : &quot; people are waiting for you to become a certain way and anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps call me some more than und@@ one , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
&quot; West Virginia Governor , announced that he changes the party &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and lots of thinking ... today , I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic Governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; he added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a great announcement at West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice held not the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; according to Forbes , the only billi@@ on@@ aire is elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Forbes states that he possesses Kohl@@ em@@ ins in five states , and he inherited carbon business from his father . &quot;
he is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us than we would work to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ s and the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last ref@@ us@@ al of a party that is not able to find a positive , agreed message , &quot; &quot; the R@@ NC chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
&quot; the world &apos;s world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , comm@@ ended on Thursday , what he described as a manifest debt from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he was not the moment for the country to be taken again in the sport . &quot;
Russia Athle@@ tics @-@ Chef Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that the ban of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to combat the d@@ oping .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all the athletes , those with competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress agreed on the maintenance of the Verb@@ ots in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) has found evidence on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the Rep@@ orters . &quot;
&quot; the whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation is aware of it , that they have experienced quite a hot times , and everything is possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
CO@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think progress was achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin with the Athle@@ tics Championships that will begin on Friday in London after the strict ILO criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfill some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited or prohibited . he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
tragedy for in Mali fro@@ sted soldiers
&quot; at a funeral service in the northeast Fr@@ itz@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two were thought on a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place in the Dom@@ stadt in the Dom@@ stadt on Thursday .
&quot; for even un@@ clari@@ fied Ab@@ stur@@ geon , Secretary of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing . &quot;
they described the two pilots but as &quot; C@@ ould of their expertise . &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest victim , which they have accomplished in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ ili@@ man from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
&quot; their kill@@ ings were transferred to Germany , and on Thursday accompanied by a defeat of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter . &quot;
&quot; at the noon , only the families in the church was farewell . &quot;
&quot; after that the funeral service began in the circle of family , closest friends , representatives of the German army and politics . &quot;
&quot; among them , H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; sad@@ ness laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood in arm in his arm . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
Secretary of Defense from the Le@@ yen described the soldiers &quot; highly decorated &quot; and included in a sat@@ ra@@ int .
&quot; the Chief of Staff had built the flight operations of the helicopter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , which the soldiers also belong to which the soldiers did not turn off , &quot; &quot; if this crew could not waste the crash , there was no one . &quot;
&quot; doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen was not : the deployment is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of high importance , &quot; for a country where we are separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are att@@ acking , the Bundes@@ wehr made no data . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried after his death in addition to his wife . &quot;
that shared the king house on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen &apos;s decision was understood with the decision of their husband was it further in the message .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he does not have the intention to join in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a h@@ eh@@ l of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the thr@@ illing of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he retired to reti@@ re , and also sets the title &quot; prin@@ cess Su@@ pper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark didn &apos;t get the title and the function he wanted to see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be placed in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked in the past 50 years .
&quot; born in London in 1965 , Mar@@ gre@@ the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met in London . &quot;
&quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had always flo@@ ated with the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 @-@ year reg@@ ression with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography commented Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was s@@ wollen , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoke instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and the reputation of being able to be the brand of social intellec@@ tuals , I couldn &apos;t hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
they were like two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; defe@@ ats Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is returning to the loss of the red @-@ green government for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to get back . &quot;
&quot; because of the parliamentary resolution , the Parliament spoke out on Friday . &quot;
&quot; previously , the unexpected exit of a Green Party in Lower Saxony was over@@ thrown by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the country @-@ election the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its short@@ fall A @-@ votes majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets founded their step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for election 2018 in its election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday . &quot;
CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record it .
&quot; there@@ with , CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Dutch @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; to date , the ratio was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new national day is elected regular on January 14 next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government had to decide whether they could continue in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Weil , however , believes it is indispensable for indispensable that the national day decides its self @-@ resolution as possible . &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the state will also see the opportunity that the governor of the Prime Minister will withdraw the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities needs to be fully checked , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said . &quot;
&quot; you will answer all questions , if they are legally tested reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very well . &quot;
they described themselves as a tag of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called the ab@@ dic@@ ed members to return their country watches .
&quot; of course , we assume that they have received their country code that has received it over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; the National Chair@@ end Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said , &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
she decided to make no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; even in front of the background , that there was no in@@ correct differentiation , we cannot perform this step . &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the takeover of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ests to CDU out as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behavior of the former Green members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re@@ activate the Land@@ tag quickly .
the Austr@@ o @-@ green in Lower Saxony costs the majority .
&quot; in her past E@@ it@@ el@@ ity and in her Fr@@ ust their personal interests in front of the country &apos;s interests , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ation and tries to beat out political capital .
precipitation of the CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ uties to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CDU .
&quot; the SPD head of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets with personal car@@ ri@@ ors , thinking the outcome of the 2013 landing election . &quot;
&quot; the CDU was the strongest force , SPD and Green had a hau@@ gh@@ ted majority in the land of the SPD . &quot;
&quot; agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect against Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ gh , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses the contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect the consumer .
&quot; in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Federal Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) . &quot;
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect the consumer from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer goods and consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the plug pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to all that we know , an health companion is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance from the Federal Minister of Agriculture was not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been shut up immediately and since announ@@ cing the suffer@@ ings of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all the information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
&quot; the trade , as well as the manufacturers are worried that the sold @-@ selling products are bu@@ si@@ able and health . &quot;
&quot; when for eggs of the back@@ rest content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to such knowledge , the production companies does not meet a direct guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to calculate due to suspected illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are little checking in the harvest . &quot;
&quot; does it only lack the staff , or at the narrow jurisdiction ? &quot;
&quot; there were just the official controls , that have exposed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , food fraud and criminal energy could never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; just therefore , a consistent statement of such events and the hand@@ over to the coun@@ ties in the cases , in which crimes can be present , are of crucial importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made several times already , that I expect from the responsible authorities a joint declaration . &quot;
is the regular alarm clock in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer goods and consumers have the right to get solely safe and bu@@ stible food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are too righ@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; manufacturer , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation , which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
basically must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds fi@@ ves in post@@ ure animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it must be consistent consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact would be swi@@ vel@@ ed and appe@@ aled .
how to move to Paris &apos;s financial rules on Ne@@ ym@@ ars to Paris
&quot; the rules on which targets to prevent un@@ loaded issues of European football matches , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona will not distur@@ b the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; some consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which have been launched in 2011 by the UEFA Cup , make sure that PS@@ G has to point out , that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ym@@ ar is received a salary that will amount to $ 10 million a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can do the money with safety , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar signs and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , in view of the financing of the teams by the rich rul@@ ership family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply a lot of money for acqu@@ iring players a lot of money , but must ex@@ ert with legitim@@ ate income sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; in 2007 , FF@@ P has been designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs that had enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ky to recru@@ it , when banks or owners went back their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P increased from concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model used by Roman Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich originally used 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the team and build a global brand - to a harder matter .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , Clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 came from the presidency in Un@@ g@@ nade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to deter excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will still strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ de@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package fee , it may distribute the amount of invoice about the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the read@@ mill for the next five years can be reported in the amount of € 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G got a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the European Champions League for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to over@@ lap their financial vision by making their income by companies , which are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could spontaneous the PS@@ G if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not be regarded as legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings of PSA by the Qatar Tourism Authority was blo@@ wn up . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments could come to Ne@@ ym@@ ar via payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have disputed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM amb@@ ass@@ adors will be just to find out such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA Reg@@ ulations Auth@@ orities .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEFA will be more attentive , to consider every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEFA has no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of the An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were unable to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million , achieving a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars is a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases . &quot;
&quot; the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature . &quot;
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ars , claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financed d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of the last owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose organisation is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des La League for a state that has financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years completely , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country owns an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
&quot; during the past few years , choc@@ ol@@ ate Fre@@ y is manufactured on board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the k@@ is@@ ses collabor@@ ates in front of a possible end : the Air@@ line writes the order . &quot;
&quot; on request by the news agency S@@ DA , Swiss @-@ Spre@@ aders Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; on request . &quot;
&quot; according to recent planning , airline airline will conclude its new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be reviewed and subjected to quality control every two to three years .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current suppliers Fre@@ y Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; at around 17 million small red @-@ white pla@@ ques and 14 grams per year , the flight att@@ endants were distribut@@ ing to passengers a year before landing . &quot;
&quot; about the cost , Swiss did not want to make any information . &quot;
&quot; industry insi@@ der estimate the order volume according to &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 @-@ 2 million Swiss francs , an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the promotional effect : there is a prestigious order for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ous company .
&quot; as many candidates in the new tender bid , Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in question , but only Swiss manufacturers are coming . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ ates Fre@@ y wants to make an amendment to the Treaty establishing the Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for opinion . &quot;
chocolate boards distributed Swiss since 2006 on board of its flights .
&quot; before the Swiss Life concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss led two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocol@@ ates Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ distance trips , customers of the First Class with treats are spo@@ iled by the conf@@ ection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gl@@ i , in Business Class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi by Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

&quot; it is the moments of random mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a sort of repe@@ ating &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; shows how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its east @-@ against @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;

the main tro@@ t - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt to be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some beautiful tags to view ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess in television , how Americans may do it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of the famous speaker - among them Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; voice &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so very much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda campaign - a mur@@ derer who carries a Reagan mask - is often referred to as a single one .
&quot; at six long episodes there is gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , who has been re@@ dig@@ ged on a lower length , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef once again visited the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who shi@@ fted a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food .
the fic@@ tional Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it even with our own younger history and with their generations .
blow against drugs in the country
the police has succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konst@@ anz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous exhibits were searched out on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 15 certificates were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and has already issued arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials introduced major amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same Raz@@ ces in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Italian , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are therefore probably extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the promotion .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia is accused of drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s public prosecutor formally established the public drug trade in southern Germany . &quot;
between the state bars in Constance and Palermo there was a re@@ active exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
so the Big Day on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo tomorrow .
&quot; in line with regard to the investigation , Italian nationality was added to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; even a incident on May 27 , in hips , in which morning several shots were fired at a restaurant in early morning , is likely to go into the gang &apos;s account . &quot;
way compl@@ ains large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; the data of citizens who should not appear : &quot; according to a report , the fore@@ igner @-@ register in Germany shows substantial defects . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ ding defects in asylum procedures .
&quot; the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has been att@@ enti@@ vely attentive to a media report on large mos@@ quit@@ oes . &quot;
&quot; defects in the data registered there may result in asylum procedures and deportation &quot; to partly gra@@ ding failure , &quot; warned manner in an analysis that is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the properties , there are estimated 10 million people with foreign nationals , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data will therefore be administ@@ rated by approximately 600 applicants of country agencies in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been kept sufficient , the data quality in parts have not been good since so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens and are not allowed to dive in the register . &quot;
&quot; faulty data set can significantly slow back processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on out @-@ out humans , the EU citizens must be recorded , that would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; however , such false statements led to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with trav@@ ellers , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government began to send refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when traveling from there . &quot;
this is the result of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re@@ es Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible to write the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin agreement , the EU government is responsible for refugees to reach first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back into the invasion . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the office now write : &quot; meanwhile , the reception capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
Italy have given guarantees for the recording and accomodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) keep this commitment to sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the inter@@ iors of the Lin@@ ks@@ fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatened because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of human rights and an endang@@ ering of the child &apos;s welfare . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have increased spec@@ ulation about an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; orders will remain , when they kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fied pressure . &quot;
&quot; in this month , the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) voted to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month , because the economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its fourth annual rate of inflation , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that inflation would continue to rise to almost 3 % in autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they reported that in the next few years , interest income would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of the Bre@@ xit , and said that the borro@@ wers would have to rise more than expected to rise to the financial markets . &quot;
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut @-@ business package that was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will require a time for financial planning to provide funding from the upcoming February budget financial aid for banks , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion Po@@ unds Sterling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because pressure on the real wages are still bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
&quot; on the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cooling down inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent as the markets await . &quot;
the markets forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
&quot; the bank emphas@@ ized however , that increases &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bank forecast down@@ ward growth forecasts for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May . &quot;
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change occurs after the most recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth rates have increased the increasing expectations on an interest rate and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by increasing inflation and low @-@ level sal@@ aries , since the disappearance is first even worse before they can repair themselves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they added that monetary policy in the next years does not prevent &quot; &quot; income &quot; , &quot; but added that wages were clearly to recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods which is attributable to the weak Po@@ unds which will compens@@ ate for a proportion of lower consumer spending .
the decision comes from a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the S@@ inken of the P@@ eas@@ ing .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the final judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the reputation was increased after a interest rate , because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected to re @-@ wear it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the aims in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; to attribute to the weak pounds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ ale , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ise Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent return of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive more competitive , as the lending was strongly looking for stores and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is especially good for those in which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with free @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to rub HIV drug to 10,000 people
patients will benefit from September following a fight against funding of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV prevalence treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one recorded the prevalence of disease progression in high risk cancer by around 86 percent , now supported by health service over a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he was willing to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal uph@@ eld an appeal by the Supreme Court in the past year , according to that N@@ HS had to pay the evidence that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; published on Thursday , chess was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first to meet the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 . &quot;
a result of HIV medicine ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV @-@ transfer@@ ring in infection areas .
p@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; among those who come to question , are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified to be identified in hospitals , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to have anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a domestic physician , can also apply to a possible participation in their local participating sexu@@ al@@ clinic . &quot;
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medications in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study is intended to assess the total potential of Pr@@ EP by using clinical evidence as it is targeted at a large scale , incorporated , and implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should add the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
there is another milestone in the more than three decades of persist@@ ing progress in managing one of humanity &apos;s largest health challenges .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if targeted on needy and endangered people , provides the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with a high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a partner will be subject to improve many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out throughout the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was established , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , Sha@@ ver @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delay . &quot;
prove the evidence as trans@@ ative that drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger area , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
&quot; in love , I fell in love and made a bid on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1.000 square foot was over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed completely . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room property with a snow@@ sho@@ ok layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom , wanted to add Jo@@ anne D@@ oom and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home that was not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the task .
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other , without having to g@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but put the steel so that it had the right height above or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enables Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of sk@@ e@@ wers plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to allow him to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror felt like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; thanks to perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the kitchen of the living room may include the kitchen , if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ ated MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so that if you push the door up@@ stairs , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ diment@@ ary form , real estate agents will enter and carry out a calculation based on ground @-@ size . &quot;
&quot; here , they made it to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that make the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself into the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be turned out through good design and increased square @-@ met@@ er@@ count of some standard in something completely .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
brothers strug@@ gling for a US dollar property because of a 500 million US dollar property
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the largest real estate of Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul away . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its business must be split . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth of more than half a billion dollars , and since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the West@@ co &apos;s family founded je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Colin - from Paul is described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a judicial authorities says that Colin is owned by $ 316 million and Paul in value of $ 176 million .
the allocation of property and cash has proved to be a pro@@ found@@ ly point for Paul .
&quot; those of Colin proposed th@@ ie@@ ves have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed delay , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting over the existing business - including Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but throws Paul in front of managing some owners . &quot;
&quot; in an early affair that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to determine the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs will rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held a lawyer . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950s and bought a business in Bruns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
&quot; they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood lovers , in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans charge in the family . &quot;
Colin says that he started West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , had hop@@ ed their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me , that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is company group , whereby Colin claims that Mark were paid for $ 10 million and € Luke 26 million . &quot;
&quot; for both Luke and Mark , Paul says , &quot; &quot; said Paul &quot; &quot; has become bitter@@ ness with the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Colin has kept himself very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography in 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took part in Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to take our family name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in writing to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father didn &apos;t wish that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he was still in a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the pre@@ sidents of the media .
others tried it and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met a major problem in president Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that come into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would meet better choices if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to talk tr@@ ump by monitoring its media . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television is enough for decades - and now , where he &apos;s in the White House , its TV signal is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when a candidate was off@@ ended because of the un@@ fair reporting it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs , &quot; said the former campaign advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter followers came under control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption has a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom is ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps T@@ we@@ et had not included any more ignition material without their interventions .
we will probably never know something about the T@@ we@@ ets who didn &apos;t send the dump .
&quot; if his employees have made it a few times , anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has consistently prevent cl@@ ump contro@@ versy .
&quot; part of the problem exists , that people in a white house that are composed of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by introducing Tr@@ ump Material , that possibly promotes their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - primarily busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , pre@@ sidents of strategic reasons of desper@@ ate information . &quot;
this was an example written by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press releases , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he insi@@ sted out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president of the president of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of the K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap &quot; at the White House . &quot;
&quot; even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he has expressed false evidence in the past and has vo@@ wed them . &quot;
dump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ smith added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and General Secretary of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the dump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly attempts to do the same three months later .
&quot; maybe he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his imp@@ ul@@ sive Self , and his counsel@@ ors are still growing . &quot;
this un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master &apos;s seeking crimin@@ als get the mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the aid of the people will pray and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all over Europe will be sent to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
&quot; as the addresses of the requested sword crimin@@ als are not known , they are hop@@ ed from the population and pray . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion to follow the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
&quot; the experiences had shown that many vol@@ atile on holiday resorts , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
there were 21 postcards collected for selected de@@ crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online request could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website . &quot;
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate on a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands have been negotiated with some resol@@ ute travelers in the foot of war which have dug out of the church dra@@ gged a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
&quot; passengers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after having been cast out only in May , without stopping by one of the arch@@ eological excav@@ ations , to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pressed their vehicles by a section which remained un@@ impe@@ ded to find a path .
&quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it is &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley Heath , where they have been thrown onto the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced through shame to implementation , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved , and are now back again . &quot;
&quot; more than yesterday evening , more likely today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to do so , by keeping long sub@@ instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ et@@ brook Road and I am not happy to pay my plan to pay , if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a resident who would not be called , said : &quot; it is ridic@@ ulous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of the camp beyond the Stre@@ et@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our image collection , it is very important that as possible , many people are aware of a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior at the police by calling on 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation , in which the judgment must test , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise takes place .
the house in front of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
that &apos;s good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the former ambi@@ ence of the company GmbH on April 13 , 2014 , about 30 000 nights were lost each year , and proceeds through the local tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees benef@@ itted in the county , the hotel building offered as a collective accommodation , provided for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the order of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous at that time .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Upper Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and said already by serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
&quot; Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ancers , with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the earlier hotel of Birken@@ hof there have been a longer time building blocks in front of the entrance , and when you ride the house , it will be clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; floors were torn down , blank@@ ets are dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the whole hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; until March , there is much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be re@@ done in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are fitted with large @-@ walk showers , the input area is re@@ designed , there are new windows installed . &quot;
everything should be &quot; beautiful bourgeois , &quot; just like Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; not to move on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher downtown level , Sch@@ erer st@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms , wide set up , explains Sch@@ erer continues . &quot;
&quot; both holiday homes , groups or business people are to feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , he already led the loser . &quot;
the performances of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to precisely determine . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; external services are also brought to front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Representative to Grand Jury
&quot; in Russia &apos;s affair , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump should have used a special Jury Robert Mu@@ eller according to a report a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; the panel has recorded work in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal to the matter . &quot;
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller have expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; the station CNN reported that there was already first preliminary charges of the gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
the US intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps Ele@@ ction Bal@@ aam and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men are supposed to compete in the election campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the magni@@ fying glass . &quot;
&quot; the Washington Post , wrote some weeks ago that the Sonder@@ komm@@ ando Tr@@ ump personally wrote in the centre and examined the accus@@ ation , whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to examine and decide if the charges should be charged .
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore also called count chambers .
&quot; mostly they are switched on , if there are bigger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process is always done behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge individuals to the inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
&quot; according to the radio station CNN , pre @-@ charges were issued around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps advisor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ hner and his dam@@ s election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the interview . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on Thursday evening in the US television that the translation show that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date in his work , and that it should be necessary to beat quickly . &quot;
&quot; but , however , that the Grand Jury must be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the en@@ forcement of the gre@@ ek was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the subject give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; to feel good , because they have nothing else than they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special adviser to T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he kno@@ weth nothing of the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; these , however , usually have been working in secret , stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent on &quot; fair &quot; mode .
&quot; the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey told three times , that not against the President . &quot;
&quot; there is no reason to accept that something has changed , it was said in the declaration . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this ra@@ fts , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump became no@@ isy , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump gave him a attitude of investigations against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under big pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to the US media , the White House collected material against the Sonder@@ komm@@ ando and its employees . &quot;
the spec@@ ulation of spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump is dismissed Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent special congress of the Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , said Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has fired a position in which he could be fired in theore@@ tically to the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republican and Democratic sen@@ ators issued the bills on Thursday , after which the Sonder@@ komm@@ ando could no longer be released . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Ice@@ berg drives in the Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic iron mountain has solved just under seven times the size of the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the more than a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large Kol@@ oss now operate after the north , and will probably take two or three years until he melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice@@ bergs who have registered researchers in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; in what extent climate change played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice@@ berg , is un@@ clear to research data . &quot;
&quot; a total of 30 years , however , there is a series of unusual m@@ out@@ breaks in the region , the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) writes in a fac@@ tions background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , the global warming could depend on global warming . &quot;
now the broken fl@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra so far .
gravel swim on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it still grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is located south of South America almost on the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
&quot; north of this sho@@ vel , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ ort was disturbed some years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete whi@@ st@@ le to be broken there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there are some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is in danger , because the front edge is never so far withdrawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice board drops under voltage and could be crushed in case of a piece of keys . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and ice@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the shr@@ ink causes that the gl@@ ac@@ iers are directly flowing into the sea with much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small size , the British research project writes to the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s of Antar@@ c@@ tica after A@@ WI @-@ data with almost 50 000 square kilometers . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 metres . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural place and no direct connection to climate change , the iron sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; in scientists have disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s again grow again or go back in the long term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these scientists do not return to climate change , so in the past decades , many king@@ fis@@ hness of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are destroyed during the past decades . &quot;
this long skir@@ t of Antar@@ c@@ tica stretches towards South America .
&quot; following data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the iron surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has risen in the past 50 years by around three degrees , with it to the areas where the temperature is fastest growing . &quot;
CDU wants to stay pet rate during personnel
&quot; because it is still more difficult to occupy vac@@ an@@ cies , the CDU requires the CDU out of the employer &apos;s association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k takes 41 new jobs in administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the apprenti@@ ces at the circle are obviously very sought .
some 620 applicants have been to be paid for this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still lacking staff to tackle the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are currently 50 offices in the district M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought . &quot;
the CDU would now want to join the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG as well as experts in the administration .
&quot; according to the desire of the parties , the administration is to work as a concept for personnel production and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term constra@@ ints on specialists , but to make future orient@@ ated the applicant means to counter@@ act it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should look forward to inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training initiative , call CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has to do with personal problems , they did not know it earlier . &quot;
other cities advert@@ ise good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is written by a regular &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age of age , comes out of service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CDU faction , goes beyond the common motion with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had already gone out in the chal@@ k day for a break @-@ up surprise when he publicly presented the public personnel in question , and bl@@ oss@@ oms the rest of the parties . &quot;
nations would like to be reviewed all possibilities that allow all possibilities to make an exit from the municipal employer .
&quot; if we do not expect short @-@ term solution here at short notice , the round@@ about administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular towns - aim to achieve a pet rate , &quot; says peoples . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CDU tries to pay more employees and officials to pay better than the tariff for the Public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , increases or more money only if you changes in a higher level , which is oriented to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle has grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law . &quot;
not least through the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers the governor Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : you have too little personnel .
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue their own rules if they do not keep up new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said interior minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ n@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organization &apos; Youth R@@ ed &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way which facil@@ itated illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organisation , which has been in operation since one year , refused to express itself in exec@@ utions of the Italian state @-@ ordin@@ ate Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we &apos;re very sorry that in the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can evaluate all alleg@@ ations that are currently collected , first assess after we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ets &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , supervised since October . &quot;
&quot; it is presum@@ ed that his crew also takes place on board , which can be delivered directly from men &apos;s traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can recover , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; this meeting was supposedly found only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the no@@ des of the State of State , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected to have taken over the authority of the Italian coast @-@ guards , the lif@@ egu@@ ards in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves taken away . &quot;
under the code of code you need to have boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a in particular an Italian police officers who monitors their activities .
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far explained to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , because they do not have any &quot; essential amendments or disability &quot; of their lif@@ esp@@ an inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ n@@ iti also said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy , in the last weeks , the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast @-@ guards and cooperation with the local civil society . &quot;
&quot; during the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; the Minister said . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens , this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
An@@ gli@@ de and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ ing Bik@@ ers , the &quot; &quot; Berliner outside posts &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in Northern P@@ fal@@ z , for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed scenic spots , partly on towers where one could look beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing pl@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; between there , there was always longer inc@@ endi@@ ces , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day they went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Pop@@ ular Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; the look@@ out spot to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ tim@@ eter were predicted . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters offered . &quot;
the bi@@ ker in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ ched the bi@@ ker in the open @-@ hand medicine .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga suits for e @-@ sport
&quot; the Sport @-@ Stars will be sitting in front of computer consol@@ es , instead of strug@@ gling with wind and weather across the stadium ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long been to a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high prices . &quot;
&quot; they also recognized the first federal lig@@ ament , who increasingly engage themselves in this area . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 , V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and two professionals for the computer game of FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire the new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Managing Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certainly , &quot; that there will be some clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; at the next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; with which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven will be qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt &apos;s also great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football player .
&quot; the real soccer must be dealt with in particular with the 14 @-@ 30 year @-@ olds that young people are still going into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to capture all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sport athletes under contract you could be online far more often on these markets , as only once a year to send the federal government to Asia . &quot;
what about it ?
&quot; in the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA on competitions . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sport , they have long been established , in which professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in Asia play , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a real sport type ?
&quot; for many , the performance is certainly used . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y has also dealt long with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German sports school in Cologne , E @-@ sport is a sport , because he &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classic sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; besides , cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast responsi@@ veness . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not just take advantage of the console but also exercise their body on nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte Player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ bers can also see problems : &quot; D@@ oping is always a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult in online games , and in the scene failed the structures of classic sports . &quot;
&quot; a positive effect , the scientist raises the high integral effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are international on the way , which is like a great global family , there is no inter@@ cultural shirt . &quot;
a study by the management consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport is a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , it has been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales will be at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football league , it is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
there are many countries going on .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
some things in Europe also does a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first @-@ league clubs in France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany declined &quot; , &quot; V@@ f@@ B directors declares R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , was sentenced Conrad Roy to suicide . &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through lyrics and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole . &quot;
Carter was convicted in June for negli@@ g@@ ent murder of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the vocation .
&quot; she was confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy had played at a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ use , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ wards @-@ related eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; the State Prosec@@ ution said . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility for it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said , it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance she is completely de@@ pl@@ eted . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find that their age or irrit@@ ant or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no one day in which I don &apos;t use the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be proud of me and how I am with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will bear for ever and for eternity , to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be persecuted by the realization that she would never be able to take part in the wedding of her brother or a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this one person , with whom I was together in my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep my life for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a righ@@ t@@ ful preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to comm@@ ence suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mono@@ xide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case went on national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging up , spring of a building , restore yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she was sent to his family in two weeks before his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything that you need to do is the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was seeking attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case by some media .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; the few we defended Carter , belonged to Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced to Italy in 2007 because of murder of their British co @-@ residence in Italy before being acquitted of two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain , is no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern p@@ utt@@ eth the winner Cup winner of a great season - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even when the extra piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel New had to be seen , he made him an ad@@ ren@@ ch to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment , as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot;
good that could have been better than at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also interpre@@ t K@@ imm@@ ich .
&quot; not the eight years old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen in the youth player , de@@ but@@ ants , and just out of the holiday of the professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he was chosen as a player leader . &quot;
&quot; sugar is distributed to those who want to grow much , to those who want to keep in mood . &quot;
&quot; so those who have chosen , the inheritance of Lah@@ m can be found , a small extra motivation is only used . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want to accept as a player : responsibility .
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old served as a mini @-@ lame on the field .
&quot; right behind , that is now its position , the White Bin@@ de at arm did their rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ o worked in this starting position as the one who can take the rowing also best in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to draw the trou@@ pe trou@@ pe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were engaged with themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal thus makes his lack of fitness ( fol@@ ks@@ y hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil come out to link out the achievements of the Asia @-@ Travel ( immediately only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as have no negative effect in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
it all worked very well .
&quot; in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y ran in front of the defense , both agile . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ing Nap@@ oli storm often did difficult , in addition , Sü@@ ver tried again in playing a few times . &quot;
his colleague Rud@@ y gave me that the result was not as we &apos;d hop@@ ed for .
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; playing time , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style , I was fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ used this Bavaria @-@ world is still available for new access , one looked after the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Rud@@ y for example gave not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cr@@ un@@ chy testimony at his back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; what is happening here I &apos;ve already noticed .
&quot; in Bavaria you need to win any game , too . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ FB ladies

companies satisfied with Rhineland @-@ p@@ fal@@ z@@ ic ministers : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ au@@ Tempo
&quot; it was often un@@ reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still a Minister of Economics from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wiss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
&quot; from the region , the chambers and companies from the region speak to T V request by a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the old minister . &quot;
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; knowledge is att@@ acking the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
&quot; the biggest flip @-@ turn looks at Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the priority list of the country . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Ministry is hoping to establish a planning procedure , until 2021 the building is supposed to be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays in Trier , which is in the prev@@ ailing demand of the Federal Office of the Federal Office . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the route in December 2020 , says the Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann says . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competitive companies .
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier , as inspired by knowledge , in the wine a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we have an open ear for people who want to start their own company , the I@@ HK pra@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; Trier is looking for an additional inc@@ entive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master @-@ bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro for the official master examination and 2,500 euro is intended for graduates within ten years after the master training . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; at the same time , there are fast facts at the planned street construction , while Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust the knowledge in state @-@ operation mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied . &quot;
the HK demands to have more orders to external offices .
&quot; CDU faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations on the grounds of the invoice , investing in 2017 and 2018 for more than 20 million euros , less than proposed by state roads as suggested . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country as it wants to solve the skilled professionals in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the old wide range of broadband in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had given the power supply in a I@@ HK survey only with the Note 3.4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding Internet connections and out@@ bur@@ sts .
&quot; in contrast , ex @-@ economic minist@@ ress E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still standing in the Supervisory Board of wind turbines Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens @-@ group left Lem@@ ke for April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they were already admitted into the field after four months . &quot;
&quot; Audi is to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are faced with counter@@ action &quot;
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW President said , &quot; &quot; the company is the opinion that &quot; it is smar@@ ter options as driving limits , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to offer or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler was announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes vehicles to modify Europe in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the companies as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however , nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines apply as car@@ c@@ ination and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , installations for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases , also assume what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the mighty car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen that were able to regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ devices to regulate the rules when a car was tested , but in normal handling conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , former director of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected for extradition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities had installed Audi to deal a system in order to circum@@ vent emissions standards in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi in the examination could be heavily loaded in Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is over @-@ proportional to win Volkswagen by Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ uck@@ les and the laughter against the B@@ ane
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most @-@ released carto@@ on drawing , the buttons of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he struck himself among other things as sig@@ ner for happiness cards , which fru@@ str@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the most successful day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded him at the end of the 60 &apos;s of the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
artists have always inspired the artists of the cities again .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo pieces tum@@ bled in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting on the drawing today , almost ten hours daily . &quot;
&quot; over cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches can still find a lot of spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ am@@ eless any one animal in his drawings - who has a thou@@ sand@@ al h@@ acker than opponent .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which will come to the movie wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script will not be written of him .
&quot; this is why he rather reli@@ es on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is never produced . &quot;
lavender from Provence &apos;s climate change threat@@ ens
&quot; he became a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lavender is due to d@@ rought of d@@ rought conditions and because of the disease transmitted insects , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find great headache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change during the past few years , and in the autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small zoo , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf zi@@ pper , and very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
&quot; lavender oil is not just for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very asked for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with eth@@ eric oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution and slow@@ down of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also that spray the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are resistant to dry quality . &quot;

the Ass@@ assin@@ ation of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ ce will usually meet Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for reporting over the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ heard drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them at home in 2009 . &quot;
&quot; security experts have three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ ral , ally . &quot;
&quot; you ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal cav@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; there are drug users , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the salary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make chaos dangerous of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there are no ru@@ dence from violence , and while in all the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto have come to attacks and threats under Federal guard and until now there were at least seven killed in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editor and their inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist in Mexico , wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is deeply perceived , although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , wearing T @-@ Shirts , wearing his sm@@ iling face with spectac@@ les or typical Panam@@ anian . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a special case was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murders , which are linked to drugs every year with drug dealers and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely charged . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without righteousness , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce in the regional capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was killed by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot; &quot;
the shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly out in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but to the theme of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing to silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans began arrest in the past year and the extradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , because rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey maus@@ ole@@ een for drug @-@ rounder , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ don@@ ce , was able to blame his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival competition fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have inherited the sons , presum@@ ed ga@@ it members bought each copy of the issue when she was extra@@ d@@ ited to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the def@@ endant of another newspaper that had published the same history , leaving the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar particip@@ ations in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without taking into the Rau@@ sch@@ ism problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the newspaper served a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orters loved it to publish hard working tests without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by one publication , in which they could read stories that nobody else did not deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ stra@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot &quot; &quot; award for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for its courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where she always led them . &quot;
he gave himself up to that he had fear .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October . &quot;
you need to take the task that you get as a journalist - either this or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who , like a do@@ ck@@ man , was a friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and coun@@ ties , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there are always sitting at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine use his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
&quot; his death also forced them to ask their own requests in question , how they can do the best and remain in the life . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it , if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self @-@ heating . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ ths .
&quot; when it smells wrong , away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ atives , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where people met Ri@@ o@@ ce for security training , there were suddenly no phones allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware who is sold exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; standing outside , two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were t@@ asked by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a middle class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who described the governor itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the reporter had gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug ad@@ minister de facto are under control . &quot;
&quot; for the output of this week , Ri@@ o@@ or@@ ce has carved on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known cabinet Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the State &apos;s expend@@ itu@@ res concentrated on the home of the Governor &apos;s home .
&quot; there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s Office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about it , who was kidnapped or as it happened , so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician who ruled the reg@@ ent institutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) that prevailed over the whole century .
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of severe cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous events in this restaurant , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military over@@ h@@ aul . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez would have been the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body composition . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers that prot@@ ested against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the staff had become something that they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; commenting on the next morning , Rep@@ orters Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez s@@ add@@ led a few signs and went to a demonstration by another journalist in the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and civil servants say , based on DNA tests , that it is . &quot;
journalists have become stronger in the whole country by having written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking and building blocks .
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez went away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities and rep@@ aid journalists , because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has therefore asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is concerned that their anger has injured their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , involved government officials and a equality society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug candidates , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , who were on organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media coverage group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody forg@@ eries the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and head@@ sets in addition to its separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border , Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to do as El man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez openly addressed the drug card with a Editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are escaped from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ d@@ ently the photographers of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to continue and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poets , gives to that drug dealers are troubled . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I was rep@@ orters . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do were sitting on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer when all its phones started . &quot;
a series of shooting and security forces with band@@ ry v@@ als and security forces near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the Bord@@ stein@@ kan@@ te , they released the news on the site of Ri@@ o@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens in the vicinity : a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers to see if they were in willingness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ dys@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day , at the Javier murdered , the practition@@ er asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to stretch out his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ or@@ ns of an Canadian min@@ ers were so good preserved , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his created skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something from a &quot; un@@ peaceful past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the be@@ stered din@@ osau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has expl@@ aining it as &quot; truly remarkable , &quot; bl@@ oss@@ oms &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the bre@@ wed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Shawn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he hit something out of the surrounding rocks at the square , and decided to look more precisely . &quot;
the F@@ ossil discovered that of him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all these hard work , the ready result is ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re only a bit blind with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the main director Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ rell Museum where the creation is visible . &quot;
&quot; it is going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters is resem@@ bled , although it is resem@@ bles with a arm@@ our and resem@@ bles a convertible tanks , probably threatened by meat ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage used to hide themselves before pre@@ dat@@ or , and used a barrier technology that is also known as counter@@ f@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix himself better in its surroundings and to devi@@ ate his enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creation from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have studied the wild animal and studied Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the astonishing conservation of specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of she@@ ds and arm@@ aments over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sha@@ dy , a widespread use of defense in the animal , meaning that the top of the creation was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the application sha@@ dy is common , the results surprisingly , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far from the today living animals . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure through meat e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of con@@ frontation was fav@@ oured as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sha@@ kes - do you think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous than prey , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavi@@ ors on a massive , strong mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ bs of the chal@@ k have to have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs bay was red .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate evidence of his life , including its con@@ ser@@ ene Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and was pushed into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further land@@ wards than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ serving skin , but also in three dimensions remains , and the original form of the beast maintains , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you only have a little with the eyes of Sch@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , which stood on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the King of them who lived Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings were published in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ med in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creation was found by Shawn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle up to hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips covered by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ e@@ aters was w@@ em@@ med by Western Canada , until a flooded river is flooded into the open sea until a flooded river . &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs with@@ drew its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
&quot; the rem@@ nants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the hood still cover hol@@ low tank panels along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ vation is as rare as a win in the l@@ otto . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the hol@@ low Tank plates , which carry the skull of the beast . &quot;
his right front foot is on his side . his five fingers crossed upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age to A8 : many injured persons
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured mi @-@ long bars - and G@@ aff@@ er .
&quot; on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A8 ) on the late Thursday morning , some 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the connection places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm barely 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , in@@ succ@@ essively . &quot;
&quot; above the exact number of the injured number , no data is stipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are light until moderate injuries , a polic@@ eman said . &quot;
a great host of rescue vehicles was on the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the Munich crossing of Munich , a round of ten kilometres was formed . &quot;
as a AZ reporter says it was also on the counter@@ road to massive Dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ fighters not@@ ated the characteristics of the vehicle be@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers that now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock then there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car driver and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing can sit on the train and sleeps .
or one gets deeper into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
&quot; comes the creative and we@@ aves an unclean , or ri@@ ps the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
&quot; at present , the Deutsche Bahn test@@ ers currently test@@ ers the best ticket control . &quot;
&quot; it is simply confirmed by phone , taken to make his seat and evalu@@ ates the ticket . &quot;
&quot; at present , a test operation runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we offer it out . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany in early coming year on many other remote traffic routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; to use it , however , some conditions have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to be booked an online ticket - what you already do already do most passengers already .
&quot; you also need to buy the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of the ticket booking . &quot;
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : one clim@@ bs to the train , calling his ticket to &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
&quot; their mobile devices have a message on their mobile devices , that the g@@ ast X has taken on the train and taken the booked seat Y . &quot;
&quot; comes the train conductor of the ticket inspection at place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already existing online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , keep on , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the subway - which turn to take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel without a ticket inspection through our train personnel , check out in the DB Navigator . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to design their travel time on the train of personal travel , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing executive board . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our staff have more time than today to take on individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often train , knows that in addition to delay and missed trains , the ticket controls are among the biggest troubles . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , one of the passengers don &apos;t need all documentation , which one needs for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be submitted .
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between train conductor and drivers , which leads to bad mood in the evenings , or del@@ ays in the control of their own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
even a small number of test customers can use the new service .
&quot; and this also applies to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE , Stuttgart @-@ Essen . &quot;
further access numbers on the same distance are not un@@ locked .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her heart . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of a air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post of someone from High School .
&quot; the police had just killed a 18 year child , and it still lies on the street , &quot; it was called there . &quot;
&quot; pu@@ zz@@ led , since nobody else was post@@ pon@@ ed on their feed , she finished Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Bro@@ wns and bl@@ os@@ em body which was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and their community .
&quot; she made her mobile phone , later to return to T@@ we@@ et on people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive . &quot;
&quot; there were photos of the police book and people , the scre@@ amed , and from a man who claimed to be a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebellious dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , &quot; Another polic@@ eman , his gun , cried , saying , &quot; I will kill you ... &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and we can call it typical .
&quot; at that moment , I felt shi@@ vers . &quot;
I was angry and wept . &quot;
&quot; they booked a return flight , and went home next day . &quot;
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival , love and losses , the power and power of power , which consists of the power of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered that which she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; she could not take her away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you need to know it and see it and tu@@ cked up .
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organisation , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have lucky enough to give you an experience at which she personally experienced non @-@ lat@@ itude rac@@ ism , she is not unlike the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel the feeling , I would have a bad service to hold them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ al Road , a place opposite the police administration that was waiting for a camp site when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Offic@@ ers Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped them to go to protest@@ ers .
slowly a new way of acti@@ vism began to accept the fer@@ ous form .
&quot; after 9 August totally changed , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ ses Association and focused on Ess@@ ens Justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell ran during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to document &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot;
a question came Fer@@ rell into the meaning : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ?
&quot; this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often from white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area responsible for his acti@@ vism around his death toll . &quot;
&quot; his commitment made the project closer to Fer@@ rell &apos;s project , along with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the objective was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rell@@ o &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but in order to be a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participants in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rell@@ s Life , how she loves and marry her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understand that there must be a certain danger at this work , and in the deser@@ tion of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rell@@ o &apos;s history repeated the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting for different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to consider that &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; this is not a more common type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who raised this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , even though it was in front of the front , because in a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense your energy by the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continued to pass . &quot;
&quot; Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway with a demonstration . &quot;
&quot; she describes the social environment in the area , called her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she has been cl@@ assed to a singing and she feels committed to this memorial , since it went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves people , although it is not yet built yet . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian area has been out@@ dated since the first presentation of 2009 , the people in advoc@@ ates and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the theme leaves hardly any cold . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one for the bit gallery says , &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; doesn &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or quite simple : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates suggests that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , of which the rest of the shops are prof@@ icient , the opponent feared that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; the gallery is also planned : the gallery is planned on the property , on which the peas@@ ant hall stands , in which 13 direct mark@@ eters will offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , there will be a conclusion . &quot;
&quot; gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility of sitting outside . &quot;
Simone rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been able to buy almost weekly in the farmhouse market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm always very glad . &quot;
we have also discovered the Metz@@ ger@@ ei for us .
&quot; we would wish that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
&quot; in other cities , there is also . &quot;
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eters in a market hall in the gallery moved to the height of the rent .
&quot; however , this should not be very low with the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is your shopping mall at Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , thr@@ iller or supermarket : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
one sees how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; because after all , the commodity there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the product and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , cargo transactions are rented in a shopping centre for only larger companies , because the mi@@ xes are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and what is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where should the peas@@ ant cycle during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery has actually come .
or does it create the g@@ hosts bit @-@ gallery before going to distribute all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but there &apos;s no place for a peas@@ ant hall thanks to the wa@@ ist . many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
&quot; when the farmhouse is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are seen - white , black and brown , that are almost un@@ noticeable , which depend on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ side and hair@@ cut , which you have sent from Chelsea Mann@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analysis had served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publicly owned his diplomatic news on the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has been transformed into technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and dis@@ concer@@ ting dis@@ sidents , whose condem@@ nation had been converted to Barack Obama , when he was only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted through the algorithm analysis of DNA that could look from Mann@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , such as someone can look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , such as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , has been openly pronounced on the identification as a woman , in 2013 was convicted of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that it was only a single photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ ine blonde - associated with them . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ ony and che@@ wing gum by extract the DNA from the waste , in order to produce an image how these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use have been arrested by letters that were inter@@ changeable in the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o an illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ le Images , &quot; which was predicted to convert a future in which the President Chel@@ ate &apos;s verdict would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happ@@ ier re@@ union . &quot;
&quot; there is also the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ aked divisions that he would not fix , continue to escape . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen in a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery &apos;s written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing with its super@@ large description ( the &quot; i &quot; in its family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic sm@@ ashing , whose foundation is gender , breed , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ ght@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed by involvement of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological respects , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people hope to take away from it is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned , who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , hence the 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a free @-@ release ef@@ on in the hand of the disciplines of the United States as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they put your speech in cold , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greetings from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I speak about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was taken before the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ras , which summar@@ ized like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; it was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , which had been written with graphite by their genetic Hap@@ ag groups . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which form@@ ulated themselves with Chelsea , like the movement , also behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
&quot; a nationwide human hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been a susp@@ ects after a man had been caught in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts due to murder because of its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as illustrated by Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several bul@@ ls . &quot;
one of the police administration of Chicago published a common warning system that Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the place of the event for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the bull as murder , while the police is actively searching for the two susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ing , the vice president of the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em is now in sc@@ ur@@ ging and excluded from the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operated in this study , &quot; said Cub@@ ism . &quot;
senior Treasury Assistant is Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the university and the rac@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help us to help US investig@@ ators . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and wanting to set himself up .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police administration of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said that he urged the susp@@ ect to put the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of its residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 is something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , it is un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27th . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza , published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the axis and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for rest@@ oring the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fil@@ ment the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA schedule was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA Plan to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ en@@ forcement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain any thing to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities adopted the reported results of the WA@@ DA approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state @-@ sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has under@@ gone an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; there was no state programs , and we will not admit what does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ k@@ os &apos;s words voted by Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales station R@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has been excluded from the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA by D@@ oping control in Russia in November 2015 .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan testing and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA declared itself &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di sells no eggs anymore .
the shared corporate groups .
&quot; it is a pure precau@@ tionary measure , it could continue to be assumed by no health precau@@ tions , it was stated in the notification . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably negative on fi@@ brill@@ ation anti @-@ les@@ ions . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
&quot; start @-@ ups that will help your company , not to become the next U@@ ber &quot;
Amy deliver@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start@@ up but the surveys did not function .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was just never a consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; said salvation , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed . &quot;
she has called people from the outside .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help businesses feel out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it enables companies to offer surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups to deal with employees , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to deal with C @-@ suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , Co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
deliver@@ er said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ p@@ olls and p@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a high @-@ heat card of the company that feature most complaints and which guide will have low condition results - so you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; in addition , companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you do not have been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als in which those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 , according to the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw an rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Enterprise lets you send tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ - &quot; P@@ olls , intimate answers to real time and check the warmth @-@ cards of your problem . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with the staff of bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints directly to the supervisory board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his employees is po@@ or@@ ly treated or in@@ ethical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences due to consumers boy@@ cott , workers @-@ fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee would be able to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the headquarters , a formal complaint was taken and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said that there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company could use Conver@@ cent , problems , which were sitting by executives , were hidden in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ l@@ ur@@ ging practition@@ ers - were identified faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment , lit@@ igation . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke down because of the Enron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that they weren &apos;t able to prevent their dirty clothes . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitoring ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service as well and ass@@ els the company with recur@@ rent fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who support both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ tible received $ 10 million at financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised to the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex on research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before . &quot;
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when the people are glad to feel in a company that &apos;s worth their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more strongly obliged to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ons if their portfolio businesses are well @-@ run . companies run good when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; if the analy@@ tics tools promise third parties to raise commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee commitment after the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company employees asks for your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees can motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen business to get to the collecting of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not following , employee wonder , &quot; Hab@@ t you truly hear me ? &quot;
do you care about that ?
and whom do you not care about why should I ?
&quot; Madison Reed , who is now leading to the monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so salvation . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organise several teams within the company and to add a communication training within the company to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into employees , and it hopes for a long point of view that leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high revenues . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practition@@ ers and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball players on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are maintained .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot backs and show off the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
&quot; players who are registered to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man football center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real t@@ ret@@ um mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will begin to meet the players full @-@ packed time plans . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood @-@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and carried out during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six games times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should keep 18 exercises during the course of August 18 . before the start of the formal preparations for her start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the rules of the N@@ CAA , even if they added the multi @-@ time routes of the players to add another point . &quot;
&quot; we put these enormous burden three or four days on it , and it is highly challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pressed them , they plac@@ ements spread themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it is really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices once the camp is finished , in view of the clear sigh@@ s of its fields marked by a adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which is already allowed to be a protective network behind a door@@ posts , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem , as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think people get there a room and then set up there to draw an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am therefore not very worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ feit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with counter@@ feit detection of fac@@ tual transfer of third parties and their results below the original subscription , &quot; &quot; said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a opinion on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize possible fal@@ cons , and to send them to fact , that may display results from the original article from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many of whom believe that they also have influenced US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has become a major political subject in Europe , whereby the French elec@@ torate was flooded in May with false stories , and Germany is supporting a plan to eliminate social media networks as they did not succeed , h@@ ass@@ filled Post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories from the third parties must be challenged , people want more context to meet what they read and share , &quot; &quot; Sara Su , Product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to decrease false messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ 1970s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbul@@ ent history of 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent , and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on a archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emot@@ ionally . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acts on the thum@@ b print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
&quot; and letters smell as smoke , because then a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives on a 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as it would also be there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest , I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) , this seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives , and to study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he mig@@ rated through the grounds and the ruins of the ancient castle , spoke with land@@ sc@@ ents , gar@@ dening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , night he drank &quot; whis@@ key , and began writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 , when the last decree was Elizabeth Hus@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; as a Rhodes one decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , cards that represent what had said : &quot; one could mean that country @-@ conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter a wider basis into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peas@@ ant building of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ ant began in this area and I thought , a rebellion was a good beginning . &quot;
perhaps the two are linked together ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , hidden the family of Dar@@ rell for seven years during the English re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , depicted in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell , portra@@ yed his own funeral , filled with a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was only one year later when his sar@@ g was dug out ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rell@@ s are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be perfect g@@ aun@@ er , making debts re@@ funds and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;

campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ ul@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Maria chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new roof brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot;
until Thursday mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team led to Nelson Art@@ z for the logo and the slogan .
&quot; at the end of August , a celebration of the campaign will be on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; the makers of the promotion has been on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday &apos;s website . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we know as bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens around the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action , there is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s still means . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a remarkable promises , one that gives the city a distinctive solo example . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a medium @-@ digit amount allows the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f to cost their new roof brand and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the Army
&quot; every year , at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es over retirement and transport operations in the officer . &quot;
so this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish dispute a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was not held in the building of Staff , like earlier , but in the Prime Minister &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; under the presidency of the government , the government ch@@ aired the five vice @-@ president and the ministers of Defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs . &quot;
&quot; thus , civilians were killed in the Y@@ as . &quot;
the government moves the bre@@ eder in the military .
&quot; Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and Navy were shut down . &quot;
since the failed coup of State Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire suspension of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; for 4@@ 86 people who should have been involved immediately at the coup attempt , this week is negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the crash attempt as &quot; God gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean the forces &quot; completely . &quot;
but did Erdo@@ gan really have a handle in the handle ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , concern for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head office for Sol@@ di@@ aries , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the large clean@@ ings at the Army and the security forces go further . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was fired by decree for another 73@@ 95 state operator , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed like the Erdo@@ gan of Erdo@@ gan .
gener@@ als were formerly known as the real masters of the country .
three times they sent them under appeal to their role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world leaders .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan urged the power of the military step for step , not least under appeal to reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is an objective of Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer called for asylum after the coup attempt to asylum in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; in fact , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there are doubts in the alliance after the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; NATO diplom@@ ats were weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats said . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks forward to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for the refund of vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages and billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the way to change the way to citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidate who have the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that will benefit from our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to make route for racing shuttle
&quot; again over the past few months , over the future of the rac@@ et@@ utt@@ les had been cont@@ ested , it is now going to go quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , the route is expected to be built on the tourist route . &quot;
&quot; to ass@@ ure the future of the race @-@ long term , according to information from the Ministry of Transport , this year &apos;s work will begin on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue to order the track of Il@@ men@@ au race , the country is particularly important for the tourism important connection , &quot; explained road secretary Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the track leads to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the land transfer 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be matched , explained S@@ ühl . &quot;
&quot; over the technical details , the Ministry and the Southern School of operators are already involved in the technical details . &quot;
&quot; thus , the road@@ map , the vehicles and quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race @-@ Shuttle will be ordered by a regular race on December 2017 .
the race @-@ gate Shuttle is one of all popular train connections between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and the race station .
&quot; in the past few months , in the course of a pilot operation , the distance from sufficient many people had been used to order them back in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is strong in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 is a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots .
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) report a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of ni@@ p@@ ples and type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make it funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will get them much more common , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots , with a silicone body that feels warm , with conscious human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to its beliefs , &quot; and select everything , from the eye colour of the robot via the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to type or colour of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but there will still be more excited , as many robots possess the &quot; personalities &quot; which would look like a Step@@ ford @-@ wife progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots using a silicone body .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot makes it possible for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which they are appe@@ aling , such as school@@ ing . &quot;
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of school@@ ing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is custom@@ ised as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of true companion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
it also has its mood in the course of the day - quite as real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects with this ascent of sex robots - not least because they are real human relationships - but the sub@@ sist@@ ent female properties to rape if you get a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : resi@@ li@@ ence ) Far@@ rah is troubled one most .
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or simply just a different sex toy . &quot;
&quot; its origin and its increasing refin@@ ement as@@ sign to something dar@@ ker and low@@ out in our culture , at a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes go to a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men , of course , have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices their rising popularity , they still remain provisional in the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is le@@ aked out of the boundary zones , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , will be very educational . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or offensive , until the free market gives permission to them . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lay that these highly developed sex robots are immer@@ sed in a period of time , in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which the white house has a pre@@ sidents who has responded to women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn body and the out@@ stretched eye , but how real@@ ist@@ ically this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the objective behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although also with Por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
&quot; their inheritance , they want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; robots do not represent real women . &quot;
you cannot separate or go away from their companion .
&quot; they have no delay , or a background history , nothing , which might distur@@ b to independence or anything to distur@@ b the imagination . &quot;
&quot; differently , they are counter@@ feit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the way of 2017 : rank maid service
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to understand the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human beings
&quot; it has become a li@@ kel@@ iness of the tr@@ ump era that the political spl@@ its , that have developed US voters , have also divided families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest festival , there were newspapers in the U.S. newspapers with advice about how to handle the horror of tr@@ ump relative relative . &quot;
we are all interested in order to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famili@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ wing poet that lives in Chicago and has long attended the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it remin@@ ded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including Republican relative , with whom she fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks with itself . &quot;
&quot; the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ appo@@ inting effect of his presidency has the force to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that we will not viol@@ ate his kit@@ ten of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a troubled long@@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an ep@@ it@@ ess of inheritance . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s comic version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an unbe@@ ar@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ uss@@ ers of the New York parking department , and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ur@@ ry and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ ster and the k@@ lim@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point out : the views of high buildings become old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I still haven &apos;t passed over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the topics Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park Car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange experience , since there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ year old and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I had to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I managed to drive my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same thing , plus the option to buy the evaluation by a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also practices pressure on the server to kill personality in a situation where no required is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stands innocent , while I tired the experience you get my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of Schn@@ au@@ ds to the hospital , he reportedly suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell . &quot;
&quot; because of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to an appeal against an appeal against the prosec@@ ut@@ ors of prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ ir@@ ks in the early morning hours of the Valentine &apos;s days , making them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ ally int@@ ru@@ der who was hidden in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , who they say , she was sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the national law en@@ forcement Authority said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim could be heard in this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us exp@@ ires the danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
&quot; as farmer Arnold a strange egg , finds &quot;
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ cl@@ erg@@ ents from F@@ üt@@ zen and Ep@@ fen@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the continuing schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the exc@@ use students are going to go to school , four at the real school . &quot;
school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the House Bi@@ es@@ ental in Ep@@ fen@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eag@@ les which grows in chicken yard , but then released in freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower v@@ ar took a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot; &quot;
peas@@ ant Arnold found a strange egg and made it out of his chickens .
instead of a chicken breasts a little eagle came out .
&quot; the hope to make of him a chicken , disin@@ teg@@ rated , the eag@@ les spread out its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wings . &quot;
afterwards the classes showed three and four in the formation of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken .
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder carried to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for the integration , said Scho@@ ika S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; although the young were different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but also belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its determination is to be free .
they wanted to give every fourth place that he felt in his new school .
&quot; it followed than@@ ksgiving to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who is always in school of teaching and parents . &quot;
&quot; the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is now over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher declared . &quot;
&quot; she leave her students after two years of teaching only very un@@ skilled , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
eventually they can rely on the fourth cl@@ erg@@ ents .
&quot; for completion , all pupils come a song from summer time and holiday season . &quot;
thereby the children broke great joy .
eight first names are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece

software update for diesel vehicles : what do they need to know now
how exactly does the software update takes place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve emissions of emission classes Euro 5 and Euro 6 in Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the hand@@ crafted software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously applies to vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their re@@ armament has ordered the power station @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a significant implementation in the coming months , but there is no exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communic@@ ated to write every person .
&quot; if cancelled in an inspection , this will be done in its frame . &quot;
how long will the conver@@ sions pull out overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin writes . &quot;
the hang@@ ings of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; since we have seen , the car manufacturers do not negoti@@ ate on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming might be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do motor@@ ists do , which are no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ? &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
&quot; presumably , foreign manufacturers would consider so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is now a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving forces thre@@ aten .
&quot; in rural areas , there is no value for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ am@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony of President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted Awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ w ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , and the chore@@ ographer in Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) , and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) came to the grave . &quot;
the awards will be handed over to the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump is traditionally held and together with his wife Mel@@ ania to attend the award . &quot;
&quot; the winners of Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series , thus already announced to ren@@ ounce participation at the Gala . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; New York Times &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even the means to withdraw - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to deliber@@ ate their sight . &quot;
&quot; after the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; among the previous winners Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the town vibrant
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement next year . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
and the work still makes it great fun as he is communic@@ ated in the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that await his successor . &quot;
at the same time it wonder that no application does not fill the requirement profile .
the city is seeking the next possible time an architect or engineer .
&quot; thus , in respect of regular termination @-@ periods - there is still enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; when Has@@ lach has served as an administrative authority , the applicant has to be submitted to the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city on any case .
&quot; if they could not fill out more , they would have to advise citizens to consultation up to Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the immediate proximity to the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good operating climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; more than 30 years in the office , some important projects have accumulated , on the che@@ ers with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city experience , he is sure about the building office and its staff secure . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the res@@ h@@ aping of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Dutch @-@ car park are enclosed . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ etic bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the Sta@@ di@@ on@@ ization is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike with approximately 1.5 million euros in be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; age , age @-@ to @-@ design is present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ d big game room . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s , its own building yard and gar@@ dening could be flexi@@ bly re@@ acts strongly . &quot;
&quot; you can move much &quot; , &quot; as W@@ acker , and the creation of the green plants will be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to do what it fits &quot; when new@@ builds are approved , the separ@@ ating city master is emphas@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; for assistance and coordination , he can count on long @-@ standing employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been in charge for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to be identified with the spot . &quot;
&quot; for continu@@ ity is not only important to a good operating climate , but also for the other design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if the Roland W@@ acker would like to bury Roland W@@ acker , he should have studied at the town of Has@@ lach , a graduate engineer or a Bachelor with specialised architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction work . &quot;
&quot; building and civil engineering , building planning , under@@ under@@ age affairs , management of urban property management , urban farm with building yard and municipal authority , including monument protection authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines is thrown : southern route closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators brought the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
&quot; these were badly damaged , that the contin@@ ual freight train had to be stopped . &quot;
investig@@ ators go from two male perpet@@ rators and seek them for the night hours after them .
close to the Tat@@ ry there were witnesses a ro@@ sar@@ er roller and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; that goes far beyond a website of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch said to AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators , would have brought themselves in great danger and at risk . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the facility , as well as the delay and cost of rail transport system could also be possible to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the spokes@@ man said of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , &quot; the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the railway line could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; out of ten persons , Friday afternoon , two of them looked at the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; goods were not destroyed , however , they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced about 200 metres of upper lines . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meats , dairy products and chocolate can help IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and ble@@ aching , recur@@ ring or bloody fail@@ ures , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found that contributes to the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han that promote an toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the body do not enter into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of extingu@@ ish inflamm@@ ations are balanced out of cells , which protect tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; when equilibrium is too low in the direction of inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a species of tolerance convey@@ ing immune cells occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their inn@@ ards . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to destroy the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han is toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel disease , when the same system also supports people . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as they found out that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ os@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of mice became DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found in mice carrying immune cells , but without they were missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were taken up in a ster@@ il@@ en environment , so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ous was missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria explo@@ ded on the immune system , the researcher L. reu@@ ter@@ i had to grow in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on untreated immune cells , which were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells were developed too toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid has been cleaned , it turned out as a side @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han Met@@ abol@@ ism which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells were hal@@ ved around 50 per cent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ant convey@@ ance cells such as mice , and that most of us can protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han can lead to a extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the Chelsea Po@@ unds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid will begin on Tuesday and impressed with a popularity as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic , however , had been excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour and made only 45 minutes to improve Mour@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve the start of the Premier League season before the beginning of the Premier League . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football , &quot; &quot; Mour@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u went to the Avi@@ va Stadium , as Mour@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week that Mour@@ in@@ ho still wanted to meet three further new complaints , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four major new obligations . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get there , thank you for the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
&quot; on the radar , the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be . &quot;
the whole thing was a lasting for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new entry for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns around , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD chief , the Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister ended in front with a certain concern for Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no stor@@ ks from the party centre , merely no head@@ winds out of the covenant , was the principal desire for the election battle . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed the basic change . &quot;
&quot; since then , employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House ob@@ serving the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated capit@@ als . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with counter@@ wind .
there were low impacts .
&quot; and indeed , one after another . &quot;
&quot; following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German federal state sees a generic signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can not be reliable , &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial office in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fra@@ grant of a green @-@ member government has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the Sunday election the red @-@ green coalition lost its A @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ President Michael Kell@@ ner urged the ab@@ dic@@ ated Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return to her mandate .
the result of the CDU means a clear failure of voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return to her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and election campaign of the Green Party Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true all , &quot; she sigh@@ s a SPD @-@ election fighting , when on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ a had reached the party headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing for the CDU without its own government . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the failure began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comra@@ des are at the same time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and it became much worse .
&quot; the SPD &apos;s defeat in Kiel brought the SPD , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite breath@@ ed the party smoothly . &quot;
at the time the comra@@ des moved back in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when she had exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next deep sleep was come .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
and because he went wrong in the crisis communication so much everything you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Weil .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ L@@ aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism since longer . &quot;
mi@@ ese change values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past weeks , because in the past weeks , because in the league acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; comra@@ des of the former Mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin , even comra@@ des in the field of Martin Schulz remained not hidden . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , because they spoke of because an stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
&quot; now , the exact opposite may occur . &quot;
&quot; because there is no fault at the part@@ isan area , in essence , is no fault . &quot;
and Schulz didn &apos;t even know .
&quot; at times , comra@@ des , therefore , make an effort to keep his own ranks . &quot;
&quot; their anger is stir@@ red up on the Green Party , and in particular on the back@@ sliding par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and Democr@@ ati@@ esch@@ e@@ tion , such as Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets their own car@@ ri@@ er@@ ter@@ ies on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected as a direct can@@ did@@ ature in parliament , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party . &quot;
the logical consequence would be to return to her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate of voters for four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil as Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Dutch SPD as leader in the Bundestag election to the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career of a future CDU faction sees the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he asked to clarify the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more advanced the CDU Niedersachsen has been given .
funding of Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his in the years , soon you can get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ste@@ g city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler was once again a retro@@ spective to date .
&quot; since 1991 , there has been in sensiti@@ zation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was at least 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it was finally important to promote internal development , and not only build new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , you will receive information from the President &apos;s gover@@ ning Karlsruhe that there will be a renovation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the municipality sensation . &quot;
how is a renovation area now ?
&quot; one will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but there is also a role , whether in which the planned zone should be interest , to be rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territorial limits could then move again again . &quot;
&quot; the Ste@@ g joined the Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal @-@ country program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the sanctions would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alisation of Inn@@ es , improving the residential and occupational relations and the expansion of the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective , which is called per property . &quot;
the renovation area would then be set as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; the approval period for the funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September of this year , however , only once again the inventory intake would be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the restoration of those involved . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the stat@@ ute should be made possible , so that in the coming year with the San@@ z@@ ations can be started . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that any Commun@@ e had to perform the said pre @-@ examination investigations .
&quot; it is the reason to evaluate the urban failure and decide , when it is rehabil@@ itated and in what extent . &quot;
it will also be registered for the property also a renovation mer@@ mer@@ k in the basic book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again even after sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she said . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the participation of those involved .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out after the end of summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and plot bow , &quot; where it is among other things around the structural condition and restoration . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; budget and housing &quot; , &quot; information on size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is only to fill in the building areas in the building .
&quot; however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a ful@@ fil@@ ter questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new construction measures are not convey@@ ed . &quot;
Sch@@ in@@ dler is still emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ dog prin@@ zip &quot; act - who first comes first comes first .
one could not make a transfer rate for later . &quot;
&quot; for the conclusion , photos of the &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; project was shown to make a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to get with a hand motion in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , to open his office , and can even start his car with a hand motion . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy life with technology by his company Bio@@ te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has met with Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant method is carried out after medical standard . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company from Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that was left the American manufacturing in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , if the president is on board , the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American construc@@ ting programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief civil servants of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was built in Connecticut by a yacht from Maine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck . &quot;
&quot; the White House &apos;s Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or freight , barely 36 hours before the helicopter is responsible for the Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior , Deputy Commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message was shown that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15@@ am , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared from 18 : 00 to 21 : 00 at this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds , that if the departure from the White House would be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; during the event , the original flight crew was during the event , while security personnel remained during the time on the floor . &quot;
&quot; from the TIM@@ E available records , we did not know whether a second flight crew was required . &quot;
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal government to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we introduced was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; it sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; said the Deputy Commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ strain the government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but your use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation as the presidential plane before the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy CEO of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 Occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn to depos@@ e the US President in the White House with precise centi@@ meter sets .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise landing at the White House 58 exercise landing . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted during the training of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew up to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden for any other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in the South La@@ wn , helicopter . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have Bud@@ get@@ ary records for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ations of the US Ministry for the Financial Year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
notes of the unit list the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of revenues to determine is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , research positions for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but also consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract statements . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the deployment of helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things , which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are addic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have ti@@ rel@@ essly worked . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is reasonable to lift . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was interviewed using the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ ented with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent in any respect .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .

&quot; it will be , as always difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high North is practically .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; at the moment the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not create a Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament . &quot;

how America has to hurt O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump was not happy when he set his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for mer@@ ging the sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his right wing to en@@ force the law , the congress acknowledged a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ uts around the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the design sees to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians help to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ d@@ ingly , since then , investors from the local O@@ MV , co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic weekly North Stream 2 . &quot;
the thr@@ ott@@ le is mighty .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked , which the group could withstand , and which could really hurt him . &quot;

&quot; in the previous year of Kit@@ a@@ year , 2,@@ 800 children were seated at the tables , and the need is constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also available in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 Particip@@ ants have arrived from September 1st , Chef : they warm the angel@@ ic food , add them to salad , raw food and fruit , Por@@ ter the meal individual , add the food from , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are double @-@ group as well as seventh @-@ com@@ bi facilities - decides about the tim@@ etable .
&quot; the kitchen staff now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because of this reason it is : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help to prepare food .
direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is there sensible .
even for the children .
&quot; they have known a known strength in the K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen forces - will be completed in the future of special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service , including the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm , which they have exhibited in the cost between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign making for the city as the most economical , it is called the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 partial forces will be re@@ set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the education field not so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , the UN says &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , am@@ ig@@ ning leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women in the council elections are to be elected in the provinces . three women are responsible for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters . &quot;
&quot; the role of women can &apos;t be over@@ rated &quot; , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative and credible , if women are in@@ restricted and included in all parts of the choice process . &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial government and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban issued threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international host@@ ilities to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be peaceful peace@@ fully by a democratic elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will yet intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women registered by a total of 3.6 million voters registered .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to participate in Man@@ ku@@ ite producer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie over the long term commitment to production in Glasgow in Glasgow .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland , the company said about the future of investments in the T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ location . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hobbies or rich tea cookies in addition to other products . &quot;
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and union representatives were &quot; as the first to experience &quot; when their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on to express &quot; concerns not to express the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can do no clarity over the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have been working here and the labour force focus strongly on the local community and the large area of Glasgow , an important pillar for human employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and from the background of Bre@@ xit , the growing living cost of life and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow has urg@@ ently need a prosp@@ ering production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the Fili@@ al Manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland in yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we estimate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we operate as all the companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business continuously - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ location , especially in production lines and operating improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and at all . should change our operating processes at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga is your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not follow in their persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after having left an offer of £ 189 million in order to exter@@ min@@ ate his free@@ wheel cl@@ auses , but did you warned Barcelona three years before the world record case ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has been heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the manner , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way to outside , although a source has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this view ?
&quot; when Manchester City will be interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know if they touch one of our players , then we will contact the opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign with themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club put interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International of Italy , in any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report for Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Res@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the ab@@ uses were dismissed by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man of the reform@@ ers movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German press agency , he acquired by the former ruling writer Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , a ap@@ ologies . &quot;
it would be highly recommended to the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret on their own sub@@ missions or their wrong estim@@ ation of operations .
&quot; the Vatican Council , &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that the report on violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen can be measured with &quot; two different measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the handles in Regensburg , nobody doubt that it would have to be prevented &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habits , the Catholic Church as source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep that for normal , writes Scar@@ borough . &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you are happy to go to the church and that &apos;s a second fres@@ her .
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes a quite normal educational means &quot; &quot; to be done with friends as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they are un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards in earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the abuse cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was compiled with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is located in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted from the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg , which was submitted by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg , Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; in total , 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually viol@@ ated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it is a summary that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and mental violence . &quot;
&quot; at high em@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for students could also be violent . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims were estimated to estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories of him . &quot;
&quot; in an interview , E@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion was horri@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; Society of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a lift , many students lift up his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was hand@@ some hand@@ some , when a cathedral @-@ atz has no top performance . &quot;
how do you use as his bi@@ ographer report this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , you have to ask himself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
he just devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of torture or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of his sphere .
&quot; if you like to throw him too late , it can not be taken too late or taken first inc@@ iner@@ aries not seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ atic school , on which he worked , was experienced by practically all respondents as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus , the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; qualified , &quot; &quot; qualified &quot; , &quot; used the guys regularly with cakes , cookies and bon@@ bons and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high mot@@ ion@@ ality that led to w@@ ren@@ ch too .
&quot; he did not only shr@@ ink with chairs and stri@@ pped the key and on the floor , but also ear @-@ minded boys on the hair or ears , he has already regre@@ t@@ ted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honorary ret@@ ali@@ ation , however , we have to say that such education methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread , with parents like teachers . &quot;
do you know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have experienced it in a world of world@@ ly school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school , are the free excav@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; one has already been asking if it is not more likely to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness , and his role as brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media has just crossed it on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him , still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report about the subject of mis@@ use at Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report was reported . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also added any settlement or involvement in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never got married to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a concerned representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the real problem with the declaration of sexual abuse was , and yet , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even believe parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a chor@@ us leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had a tim@@ ely guidance ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and would have been able to stop the off@@ ender .
&quot; I get it ... also for really absurd to assume , that it accounted for him ... Bu@@ ess int@@ ru@@ sive , or even more , than compared to their parents , Inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leit@@ ers , Confi@@ dence instruc@@ tors , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him over sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in the run of affected pupils and / or their environment , could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to pron@@ ounce each other . &quot;
&quot; so it cannot be charged with him , not prevented or brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name to this contradic@@ tory crime , as unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; Non@@ violence &quot; were to be read on the shelves of the burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of the &quot; way@@ man &quot; report .
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything was mixed in reporting everything and ob@@ serves as a giant mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; there is also clean separate : between the pre@@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , we say , other pre@@ ju@@ dice . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report incid@@ ents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a chor@@ us leader of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ row . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers regul@@ ates and painting , all took place at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states must have agreed . &quot;
&quot; but with those had nothing to do with the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ ik@@ eng@@ ym@@ atic school . &quot;
&quot; on that , as most witnesses came , the subject of &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
it was just happy to escape you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise states . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ ell gramm@@ ar school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : indeed , there was discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , with which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims of the general humanity have been estimated and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories of him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time , in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish itself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school , which he had not worked and responsible , ( as the witness ) was not wanted to hear , and then again by 1993 . &quot;
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ n@@ asi@@ ums , which even re@@ produced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this point , he points out that in the pre@@ school , the test would continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; already , in view of the risk of negative press release , he advised urgent action . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity had been banned as a test pen@@ alties in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , it happened in a legal grey zone , just as everyone knows us . &quot;
&quot; there was also hard to estimate for him , where the victims were exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where actually the allow@@ able border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one can &apos;t say , he had always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair , to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we &apos;re talking about the case of &quot; &quot; Fall of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of the past to present mor@@ als of mor@@ als . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already quite right .
&quot; but this is not true of course for sexual abuse , who was de@@ emed to all times and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of contradic@@ tions and violence to innocent children &apos;s days , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally working .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means to disciplines and punishment , so ear@@ whi@@ st@@ le and ear to move in the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he also kept strictly strictly . &quot;
&quot; what image of his reg@@ ain time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject test come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells of his perspective , the cathedral rows played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in no way , I still refuse to lead there a str@@ ingent regime . &quot;
&quot; but this also has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the in@@ quired discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form true cultural ambassador Europe and his musical tradition that followed twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with biscuits and bon@@ bons alone one can &apos;t make no great singers and lead before any success , in which area , yet discipline , passion and self @-@ exagger@@ ation . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again , as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep believing and heart@@ ed good people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do a fly a fly . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m getting back regularly , like many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him to read it - he is almost blind , and he is like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who didn &apos;t forgive him until today , that he once was strictly charged to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and has brought them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , good teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be , but even a lov@@ able respec@@ t@@ sper@@ son , to which they still watch them and honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again , all that one acc@@ uses to him are educational methods that were on the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad we have overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ fair , a man , only because it is promin@@ ently and an even more prominent brother to make a sin @-@ hand . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil purpose that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; because the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the annex@@ ation of the area would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who would have gotten himself great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , finally in peace . &quot;
