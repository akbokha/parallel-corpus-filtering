<seg id="1">"Munich, 1856: four maps that change your eyes to the city"</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where people are supposed to meet young people today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a tomb, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small husbandmen dominates the first reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münch encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoying if maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this knows, everyone who had been very exciting, because the car-Navi took place in a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - yet very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then, in the 19th century, the towns and municipalities have changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bavaria Atlas is a tile-carpet, which is not the same as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the great overview card, maps and communities for more detailed maps, so-called Urpositioning Sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian Surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the spring of 1800, the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the second coalition of war with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in addition, Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes."</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, when the French troops invaded the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, it was the current neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürstst Max. Joseph drove the project ahead, the" Topographic Bureau "- and hence the Bayerische Surveying Management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The pre-positioning sheet for Munich is dating back to 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"compared to early / today, the state capital is the most impressive."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the city has expanded in all directions, and has grown together."</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is a subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after creating the map, i.e. 1877, in the Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today he is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of the refugee camps are concentrated along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing as a fields - at the first glance: in the inside of zooming appears a small part map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called" "urine" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots are not present there today no farmers anymore - but small gardener in the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is drawn to the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 place of the October Festival, was actually a meadow, and no concrete destiny in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the pre-positioning sheet in the area of today's au-Haidhausen, one reads only the street names" at guest dough "or from the height" At the fan "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt." "</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße they once bullied with men once."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenaissance "At the Auer Lüth.</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the facility - the psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the Chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has signed the personnel to apply violence against the occupants," "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"first place for 280 patients was first place, later extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the KreisirrenInstitution in Hair in 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesanum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order took the building complex in 1920, and walked into a youth home with training."</seg>
<seg id="42">"located west is the football field of TSV Munich East, east of residential houses in the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, one built the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "- in an architectural appeal to the origin of the Irrenaissance, which was destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in 1856, as" main square, "the Kaufbranch office called" Kaufinger lane. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Münch.</seg>
<seg id="46">"the Allied bombs broke out in December 1944, many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a tomb in the Middle Ages, stood at the Marienhof, where these days work on and on April 5, 2017, will take place for the second S-Bahn trunk line."</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich map displays the old Munich map with the air picture of today - and the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Council published travel funds for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Association to promote Farming has issued a warning for coloured people, due to the discriminating politics and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri, which shall come into force by August 28, 2017, urges afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourianer, as a number of fragility, racial-based presence in the entire state, and here," says it is in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"recently, the Missouri Law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecution of the state, and the prosecutions of the State, the NAACP, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of civil rights, human beings."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are killed or killed because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist betrayal against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances in the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also reports on a recent report by the Office of the Office of Missouri, which is shown that black motorists will be more common than white in the state of 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and informed about their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring you to me, or the relatives know that they are travelling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri recorded 100 Hasselt, after the latest numbers from the hate-breaking report of the FBI, which accounts for the state in terms of the number of such injuries on the 16th ranking of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel agent is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued a travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States Inmigrant authorities agreed to insure people for migrant workers, which will contribute to the ACLU's view."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travelogues are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have the measure of reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">Turnkey project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisbacher Weidenaun Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag member Peter White and Kordula Kovac have been creating a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the fishing village of Schwendemann met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two delegates together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his farm, where he supplies 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milkcows and as many kittens supplies and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Schwarzwaldmilch "is the alternative way of aging for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">"at the table of the Ferihist, exclusively regional."</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he also has BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach, he described the turnkey project as" elemental. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not win a steep land on that way.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the greenery care for a lot of work, much to be edited with the sense sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann emphasized. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elterranean operation and repaid these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead to bio operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the decimal project and is glad about the leader of the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"one hope, that the view of the surfaces could still be carried out for a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how to continue their operations," "the mayor stressed."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in the critique of criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open area amounts to 40 hectares, which can not be applied until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the total cost of 71 500 Euros was funded by the total cost of 71 million, a quarter of the municipality of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers had to spend 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann stated. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you do have a really good job, without farmers and land women don't go. "</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White, the best food was produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The state of landscans (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal of the Schwarzwald is the disclosure of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">Precondition is the presence of one of the ppr signed conveyor.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the inadequate area may not be drastic (hanging over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by means of view."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisbacher Weighaunt Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots would like to build up close to 16 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the display area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the corresponding costs are more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">"the safest character of a regime change is, when they start to attack the statues."</seg>
<seg id="100">"Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the supply of Saddam Hussein's going down on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, did not know what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a heated battle with Jim Acosta from CNN about the proposal of the President to drastic immigration in the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty Imitators would have gelding him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he touched their importance, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta:" I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom which lightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller lies true, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the ascending words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the arms of the poor:" your weds, your poor, / your poor grids to breathe freely, and the ending waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh garbage" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after her death on the base - knew very good that they were doing a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republican-Republicism, portraying the feminine representation of the freedom of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a completely different name: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to go back from the right wing this long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great write-like Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty finally invite the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry out the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"rather unusual, Limbaugh went on something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and a question of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great great fact of Lazarus was there to see them as they saw from the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, the world is going to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"her statue speaks to them the words of hope, and of the welcome you need to hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not to recognize the perspective, Miller and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch shall not shine the way, but hate the hatred, which is the only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two shallots of the UK were part of the UK</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of World Championships" will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017, starting Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special was developed" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand and we will continue it until we'll find out."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on road corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butpchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah during the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle's team was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captains speech was unbelievable. "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the liiliie, of course, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-Silver medal winner that will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdle says that it is "unbelievably" is that 16 shallots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance forerunners Muir sets out five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another botte, which one should watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships as the only other band in the Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captures says that they are" enormously proud "on the fact that many of their compatriots have not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be team captains in it lies that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as an established athlete, athletes who want to rise to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is related to my speech as captains?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so, it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete there, and it simply will be so great atmosphere there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking the critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public ministry when you cannot cover the heating of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from inner policy up to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he chimplied with the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't leave his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for the year 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and dumb, as sheep are led to the battles. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">"and the American Civil Liberties Union promised him, therefore, at the beginning of this week."</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the Governors dismissed the lawsuit as a freezeout, and the online comment was full of counteraction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of its state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters, to debating his haired head to chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons that come on the side of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially referred to and by employees that are paid with public tax-dollar - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse rescued the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing further than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trot or spammers or hasshoped people, which vibrate online."</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The parish cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassented, but she asked for Hasselt."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said, courteous that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate breaking and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the message "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take on the same topic, then they are accepted by some rather than so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the Governors called "concentrated spam assault" would probably call others "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic, or delete a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in early days when you have done the same, that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guiding and burn, and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public civil servants that criticises that he implied the Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County, last the first amendment, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they named a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Before (R) received a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers increased between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters to his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">"and even then, Washington had anonymous trolls."</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius, "and" Portius, "wrote all letters of newspapers, Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitioning that criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't leave her to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, opinion of opinion, and discounts are on the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof for the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger area," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">"in love, I fell in love and made a bid on that day."</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1.000 square foot was overhauled completely."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a one-room property with a snowshook layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom, wanted to add Joanne Doom and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home that was not just a development, but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative thinking to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel structure is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other, without having to gaps."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about to build a simple platform, but put the steel so that it had the right height above or down the right height."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enables Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of skewers plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror felt like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units for all seating and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"thanks to perception of a glamorous space, the kitchen of the living room may include the kitchen, if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, furniated MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so that if you push the door upstairs, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, real estate agents will enter and carry out a calculation based on ground-size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they made it to enlarge the floor space and use high-quality materials that make the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself into the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be turned out through good design and increased square-metercount of some standard in something completely.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, as Joanne, you could decide to leave this not."</seg>

<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller have expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>

<seg id="1488">"the Washington Post, wrote some weeks ago that the Sonderkommando Trump personally wrote in the centre and examined the accusation, whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Lawys is to examine and decide if the charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Lawys are therefore also called count chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"mostly they are switched on, if there are bigger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process is always done behind closed doors.</seg>

<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the enforcement of the greek was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>

<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent on "fair" mode.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"the former FBI boss James Comey told three times, that not against the President."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to accept that something has changed, it was said in the declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">"however, Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired."</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rafts, accusations against Trump became noisy, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump gave him a attitude of investigations against the former national security consultant Michael Flynn."</seg>

<seg id="1525">"a total of 30 years, however, there is a series of unusual moutbreaks in the region, the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in a factions background."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are some evidence that the Larsen-C Schelfeira is in danger, because the front edge is never so far withdrawn as far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice board drops under voltage and could be crushed in case of a piece of keys."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and iceberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the shrink causes that the glaciers are directly flowing into the sea with much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a small size, the British research project writes to the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C Schelfeira is the fourth largest Schelfeis of Antarctica after AWI-data with almost 50 000 square kilometers."</seg>

<seg id="1542">"this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the records," he confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"in scientists have disputed whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis again grow again or go back in the long term, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>

<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editor and their inspirator of Rioce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist in Mexico, wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is deeply perceived, although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice ", wearing T-Shirts, wearing his smiling face with spectacles or typical Panamanian."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a special case was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drugs every year with drug dealers and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are only rarely charged."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodo they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without righteousness, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we miserable."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Rioce in the regional capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was killed by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with" 12th river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly out in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but to the theme of Valdez, there is practically nothing to silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans began arrest in the past year and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloody battlefields of the country, because rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"there is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-storey mausoleeen for drug-rounder, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" peace "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodonce, was able to blame his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival competition fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have inherited the sons, presumed gait members bought each copy of the issue when she was extradited to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, after the defendant of another newspaper that had published the same history, leaving the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined the founding of Rioce and sold 50 US dollar participations in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without taking into the Rauschism problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time, the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to publish hard working tests without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by one publication, in which they could read stories that nobody else did not deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riostrace, she received the prestigious" "Maria Moors-Cabot" "award for their reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where she always led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up to that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trade in Sinaloa is a way of life," "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take the task that you get as a journalist - either this or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do with so many dead... why did you not say what went before?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rioce team measures Valdez, the fun bird, who, like a dockman, was a friend who was generously with hugs and counties, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there are always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine use his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to ask their own requests in question, how they can do the best and remain in the life."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it, if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home runways and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censored and self-heating."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinths.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"when it smells wrong, away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Rioce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mixture of lucratives, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where people met Rioce for security training, there were suddenly no phones allowed. days earlier, Spyware who is sold exclusively to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"standing outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were tasked by the state government to protect the offices of Rioce in a middle class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who described the governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporter had gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug administer de facto are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the output of this week, Rioorce has carved on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known cabinet Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the State's expenditures concentrated on the home of the Governor's home.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor's Office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about it, who was kidnapped or as it happened, so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the regent institutional Revolution Party (PRI) that prevailed over the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of severe cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this restaurant, among them one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went to a military overhaul."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez would have been the best informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slim body composition. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protested against the killings of journalists, because the staff had become something that they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"commenting on the next morning, Reporters Miriam Ramirez saddled a few signs and went to a demonstration by another journalist in the Office of the Prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and civil servants say, based on DNA tests, that it is."</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become stronger in the whole country by having written in organized protests "SOS Press" on walking and building blocks.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez went away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities and repaid journalists, because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has therefore asked that she is again divided by the government, because she is concerned that their anger has injured their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, involved government officials and a equality society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism", "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug candidates, but also on the command of politicians and security forces, who were on organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media coverage group" Articulo 19 "has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die because they want you to hold the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the brewed plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he hit something out of the surrounding rocks at the square, and decided to look more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered that of him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1.100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all these hard work, the ready result is ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're only a bit blind with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the main director Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrrell Museum where the creation is visible."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-eaters is resembled, although it is resembles with a armour and resembles a convertible tanks, probably threatened by meat nivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage used to hide themselves before predator, and used a barrier technology that is also known as counterfatting, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix himself better in its surroundings and to deviate his enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creation from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have studied the wild animal and studied Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumsttechnician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astonishing conservation of specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of sheds and armaments over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shady, a widespread use of defense in the animal, meaning that the top of the creation was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the application shady is common, the results surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is far from the today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that the dinosaurs was hunted by sufficient pressure through meat eaters dinosaurs, that the evolution of confrontation was favoured as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter shakes - do you think of deer, zebras or belt - are much smaller and injurious than prey, which indicates that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behaviors on a massive, strong mored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs robs of the chalk have to have been," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs bay was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate evidence of his life, including its conserene Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and was pushed into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further landwards than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with conserving skin, but also in three dimensions remains, and the original form of the beast maintains," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with the eyes of Schielen, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaur, which stood on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the King of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings were published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank after death in the sea and was mummed in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creation was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the muzzle up to hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips covered by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters was wemmed by Western Canada, until a flooded river is flooded into the open sea until a flooded river."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs withdrew its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the hood still cover hollow tank panels along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing can sit on the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1989">And then: buffered.</seg>

<seg id="1993">"at present, the Deutsche Bahn testers currently testers the best ticket control."</seg>
<seg id="1994">"it is simply confirmed by phone, taken to make his seat and evaluates the ticket."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"at present, a test operation runs on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer comes, we offer it out."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available in Germany in early coming year on many other remote traffic routes in Germany," said a railway speaker. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the train ticket devaluation without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to use it, however, some conditions have to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to be booked an online ticket - what you already do already do most passengers already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also need to buy the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way of the ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last one needs a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works so: one climbs to the train, calling his ticket to" "My Tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"in the test customers, a button for electronic devaluation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">"their mobile devices have a message on their mobile devices, that the gast X has taken on the train and taken the booked seat Y."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"comes the train conductor of the ticket inspection at place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already existing online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, keep on, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the subway - which turn to take advantage of the passengers. "</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel without a ticket inspection through our train personnel, check out in the DB Navigator."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to design their travel time on the train of personal travel," says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing executive board. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our staff have more time than today to take on individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who often train, knows that in addition to delay and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the biggest troubles."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for often, in any case, one of the passengers don't need all documentation, which one needs for devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the consequence are endless discussions between train conductor and drivers, which leads to bad mood in the evenings, or delays in the control of their own tickets and the Schaffner at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Even a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">"and this also applies to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE, Stuttgart-Essen."</seg>

<seg id="2038">"they booked a return flight, and went home next day."</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival, love and losses, the power and power of power, which consists of the power of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning" over the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered that which she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"she could not take her away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You need to know it and see it and tucked up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have lucky enough to give you an experience at which she personally experienced non-latitude racism, she is not unlike the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel the feeling, I would have a bad service to hold them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Floral Road, a place opposite the police administration that was waiting for a camp site when activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officers Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped them to go to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new way of activism began to accept the ferous form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"after 9 August totally changed," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens Justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell ran during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document", "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came Ferrell into the meaning: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area responsible for his activism around his death toll."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment made the project closer to Ferrell's project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks with us. we speak," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the objective was not to concentrate on Ferrello's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but in order to be a community that comes together," said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participants in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents from" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells Life, how she loves and marry her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understand that there must be a certain danger at this work, and in the desertion of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrello's history repeated the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who have marked the film" BlacklivesMatter "in 2012, identified the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting for different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to consider that" the movement really is held by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" "this is not a more common type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who raised this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, even though it was in front of the front, because in a life at these cruises as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continued to pass."</seg>
<seg id="2081">"Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway with a demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"she describes the social environment in the area, called her home:" a chaos. ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she has been classed to a singing and she feels committed to this memorial, since it went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love one another.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves people, although it is not yet built yet."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian area has been outdated since the first presentation of 2009, the people in advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the theme leaves hardly any cold."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one for the bit gallery says," that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be a dream "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" doesn't need a man "(Siggi Baking) or quite simple:" size wahn! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates suggests that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, of which the rest of the shops are proficient, the opponent feared that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"the gallery is also planned: the gallery is planned on the property, on which the peasant hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers will offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction work, there will be a conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda-Platz, with possibility of sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we've been able to buy almost weekly in the farmhouse market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm always very glad."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the Metzgerei for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would wish that during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also."</seg>
<seg id="2103">The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers in a market hall in the gallery moved to the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low with the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is your shopping mall at Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, thriller or supermarket: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"because after all, the commodity there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the product and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, cargo transactions are rented in a shopping centre for only larger companies, because the mixes are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special transactions are almost no longer and what is left, will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where should the peasant cycle during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery has actually come.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghosts bit-gallery before going to distribute all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But there's no place for a peasant hall thanks to the waist. many - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmhouse is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are seen - white, black and brown, that are almost unnoticeable, which depend on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"the 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupside and haircut, which you have sent from Chelsea Manning."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analysis had served a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly owned his diplomatic news on the website of WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has been transformed into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and disconcerting dissidents, whose condemnation had been converted to Barack Obama, when he was only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted through the algorithm analysis of DNA that could look from Manning and created out of 30 portraits, such as someone can look with these genomic data, such as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly pronounced on the identification as a woman, in 2013 was convicted of 20 accusations, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that it was only a single photo - a grain, black-white selfie, sitting on a driver's seat and carries a platine blonde - associated with them."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"it produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stony and chewing gum by extract the DNA from the waste, in order to produce an image how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse have been arrested by letters that were interchangeable in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo an illustrated comic" Supple Images, "which was predicted to convert a future in which the President Chelate's verdict would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happier reunion."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweaked divisions that he would not fix, continue to escape."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen in a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery's written artistic statement, Manning with its superlarge description (the" i "in its family name is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic smashing, whose foundation is gender, breed, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thoughtler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped by involvement of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological respects, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hope to take away from it is that our genome is not concerned, who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, hence the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, as it appears with a free-release efon in the hand of the disciplines of the United States as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they put your speech in cold, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist who greetings from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I speak about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was taken before the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks, of their own genomic simulakras, which summarized like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also targeted as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Stature), which had been written with graphite by their genetic Hapag groups. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formulated themselves with Chelsea, like the movement, also behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2274">"Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem, as soon as these rooms are free during the season."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," said Mora. "</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think people get there a room and then set up there to draw an exercise."</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be crazy in 2017 is a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) report a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their ascent seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of nipples and type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make it funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will get them much more common," said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots, with a silicone body that feels warm, with conscious human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to its beliefs," and select everything, from the eye colour of the robot via the shape of the nipples up to type or colour of his fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there will still be more excited, as many robots possess the" personalities "which would look like a Stepford-wife progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots using a silicone body.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot makes it possible for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which they are appealing, such as schooling."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion as "Frigid Farrah" which gives the impression of schooling and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is customised as well as possible," warms the website of true companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its mood in the course of the day - quite as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, fixed on conversation or can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects with this ascent of sex robots - not least because they are real human relationships - but the subsistent female properties to rape if you get a step on Frigid (means: resilience) Farrah is troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just a different sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"its origin and its increasing refinement assign to something darker and lowout in our culture, at a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes go to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men, of course, have no sex robots, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they still remain provisional in the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is leaked out of the boundary zones, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, will be very educational."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or offensive, until the free market gives permission to them."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlay that these highly developed sex robots are immersed in a period of time, in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which the white house has a presidents who has responded to women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the worn body and the outstretched eye, but how realistically this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The objective behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their inheritance, they want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, on the point, when it comes to their" personalities, "robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate or go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no delay, or a background history, nothing, which might disturb to independence or anything to disturb the imagination."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"differently, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the way of 2017: rank maid service</seg>

<seg id="2426">"it has become a likeliness of the trump era that the political splits, that have developed US voters, have also divided families in small format."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including Republican relative, with whom she fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"for the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks with itself."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the disappointing effect of his presidency has the force to push us all right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"if we speak of" Normalisation "and Trump, we refer to the gruselly possibility that we will not violate his kitten of one day."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is still a troubled longtime scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the right wing" "normalized", "which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an epitess of inheritance."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's comic version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as a very mild offences."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy to qualify as an unbearable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carussers of the New York parking department, and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city, if you don't need caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crurry and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely finster and the klimpering music conveys this in a strange way."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"so many clichés of a city disappoint out: the views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream."</seg>
<seg id="2442">"thirty-five years later, and I still haven't passed over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the topics Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London."</seg>
<seg id="2443">"however, Central Park Carousel is still a strange experience, since there are two two-year-old, one 11-year old and two women in the 40-year old and all have a great time."</seg>
<seg id="2444">"if I had to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one was asked."</seg>

<seg id="2446">"at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to buy the evaluation by a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop."</seg>
<seg id="2447">"this does not only lead to a slowdown of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange, but also practices pressure on the server to kill personality in a situation where no required is required."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meats, dairy products and chocolate can help IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom in the United States, causes stomach cramps and bleaching, recurring or bloody failures, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan found that contributes to the essential amino acid tryptophan that promote an tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrol in the intestines to ensure harmful microbes that hide themselves in the body do not enter into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of extinguish inflammations are balanced out of cells, which protect tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when equilibrium is too low in the direction of inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, a species of tolerance conveying immune cells occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their innards."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to destroy the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"it suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan is tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease, when the same system also supports people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as they found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it is thought that the difference with the intestinal microbiosomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of mice became DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found in mice carrying immune cells, but without they were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were taken up in a sterilen environment, so that a intestinal microbious was missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria exploded on the immune system, the researcher L. reuteri had to grow in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on untreated immune cells, which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells were developed too tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid has been cleaned, it turned out as a side-product of tryptophan Metabolism which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells were halved around 50 per cent, but when tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant conveyance cells such as mice, and that most of us can protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan can lead to a extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri."</seg>

<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "Society of Violence" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen plant" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a lift, many students lift up his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"in the other hand, it also appears as cheriker and perfectionist, which was handsome handsome, when a cathedral-atz has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use as his biographer report this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, you have to ask himself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He just devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of torture or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Non-violence at the preschool took place outside of his sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"if you like to throw him too late, it can not be taken too late or taken first incineraries not seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymatic school, on which he worked, was experienced by practically all respondents as literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony," "competent," "competent," "competent," "competent," "qualified," "qualified", "used the guys regularly with cakes, cookies and bonbons and" always surrounded by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high motionality that led to wrench too.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only shrink with chairs and stripped the key and on the floor, but also ear-minded boys on the hair or ears, he has already regretted, deeply regretted and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honorary retaliation, however, we have to say that such education methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread, with parents like teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have experienced it in a world of worldly school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and non-violence at the preschool, are the free excavation."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one has already been asking if it is not more likely to do with his acquaintness, and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just crossed it on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him, still zealous."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report about the subject of misuse at Regensburger Domspatzen report was reported."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also added any settlement or involvement in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never got married to talk to my father or my mother," "said a concerned representative for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem with the declaration of sexual abuse was, and yet, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even believe parents and siblings, then not a chorus leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had a timely guidance (Georg Ratzinger) and would have been able to stop the offender.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I get it... also for really absurd to assume, that it accounted for him... Buess intrusive, or even more, than compared to their parents, Internatsleiters, Confidence instructors, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him over sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that in the run of affected pupils and / or their environment, could not be confirmed as part of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to pronounce each other."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"so it cannot be charged with him, not prevented or brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name to this contradictory crime, as unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" Nonviolence "were to be read on the shelves of the burger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of the "wayman" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything was mixed in reporting everything and observes as a giant melange from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there is also clean separate: between the preschool and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we say, other prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a chorus leader of the cathedral-sparrow."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys of sadistic teachers regulates and painting, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states must have agreed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those had nothing to do with the Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger, for he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspikengymatic school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, as most witnesses came, the subject of" preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was just happy to escape you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspell grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: indeed, there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, with which the report concludes that" many victims of the general humanity have been estimated and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories of him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the accusation remains to have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time, in which it was reported by the states on the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he just began to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school, which he had not worked and responsible, (as the witness) was not wanted to hear, and then again by 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Domspatznasiums, which even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this point, he points out that in the preschool, the test would continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already, in view of the risk of negative press release, he advised urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity had been banned as a test penalties in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it happened in a legal grey zone, just as everyone knows us."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also hard to estimate for him, where the victims were exaggerated or dramatic and where actually the allowable border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one can't say, he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair, to apply today's educational standards to the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we're talking about the case of" "Fall of Anachronism," so the danger of the past to present morals of morals. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is not true of course for sexual abuse, who was deemed to all times and not for what was broken in the preschool of contradictions and violence to innocent children's days, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I'm glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means to disciplines and punishment, so earwhistle and ear to move in the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he also kept strictly strictly."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his regain time has Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book" My brother of Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, the cathedral rows played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, in no way, I still refuse to lead there a stringent regime."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this also has to be said: without these perfectionism, without the inquired discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form true cultural ambassador Europe and his musical tradition that followed twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone one can't make no great singers and lead before any success, in which area, yet discipline, passion and self-exaggeration."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and again, as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believing and hearted good people, from which one can't imagine that he could only do a fly a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I'm getting back regularly, like many former Domsparrows today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him to read it - he is almost blind, and he is like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who didn't forgive him until today, that he once was strictly charged to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and has brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, good teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be, but even a lovable respectsperson, to which they still watch them and honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again, all that one accuses to him are educational methods that were on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unfair, a man, only because it is prominently and an even more prominent brother to make a sin-hand."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil purpose that is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"because the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the annexation of the area would have acquired a 93-year-old man, who would have gotten himself great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburger Domsparrows, finally in peace."</seg>
