gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the pyramid of sports
his experiences on the horse are straightforward .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er was seeking a bit of variety with a ride on the beach . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ olds .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
&quot; after a couple of minutes the horses rec@@ alled to their holiday , they hunt for the quick gala dinner at home . &quot;
&quot; a kilometre from this temp@@ o , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and thus , the riding career also ended again . &quot;
on Saturday the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - back in the vicinity of horses .
&quot; he left himself with his family over the system of AL@@ RV , on a horse he couldn &apos;t take a photo of photo . &quot;
it was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistance handed over to the man from An@@ hausen at a small gala the golden sports pyramid .
the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men are lacking in awards .
&quot; federal secretary , silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions @-@ tour player of the year ... &quot;
even British Queen already inherited him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyr@@ am@@ ids .
in Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this distinction means a lot to me , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; for she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lang@@ er promotes the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the $ 25,000 prize money to the money . &quot;
&quot; with 15 further outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ fold US master winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports &quot; in Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the novel Corn@@ elia Han@@ ic , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , who was wonder@@ ing Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ thum@@ b of the hand@@ over of Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports events were come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ate society of the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept the distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are however at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton lies a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can damage - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to climb the economy to death and regulate to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , he himself would be quite different , claims dro@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will return Reg@@ ulations , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching control reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Clinton says : the state has to fulfill specific tasks , he has to open the dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the wealthy would be increased , says she . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in that season , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ t@@ ful . &quot;
the Democratic Can@@ didate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , the internal discussions could be added . &quot;
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and return the coal extraction in the USA .
oil production is also possible to announce the Paris Climate Agreement to the Paris Climate Agreement .
&quot; by contrast , Clinton wants to strengthen renewable energy with their investment program : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; there will be either China , Germany or America , and I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ os@@ fish trading agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the United States would not want to protect themselves from international trade - rather than American jobs . &quot;
they should then be paid even better for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars was a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what do you want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , The minimum wage needs to be , then he says he would not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of both bearings .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to boost its economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him before , so the budget deficit would only be bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who wants to demand more of the rich , that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every gro@@ unded wife has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost daily life . &quot;
&quot; if they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; every one has a baby , which is a year old . &quot;
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he looks into the room with great eyes .
his mother rigid on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid programmes in Bavaria , and deals with the topic women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are vol@@ atile .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no one - not as visitors .
the exception is a wax before the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated : every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because of them torture or death , because they send them their families as a hop@@ eful to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many are secretly steal , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced labor , religious mor@@ nings , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; for example , that t@@ ug@@ boat calls for a bottle of water a sexual act is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that when they arrived in Germany , B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , women in refugee accommodations would often be regarded as inferior , and in worst case . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 per cent of women , living in the area of Munich , are traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so pleasant to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the awakening , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t dare to help , it only need more accommodations for them , urges B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments for the accommodation of refugees are in charge . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether they w@@ it from a similar project as in Munich in their authority field , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ p@@ fal@@ z and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is not something about the governments . &quot;
&quot; in Schw@@ aben alone , women were not divided up separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ ten@@ ers of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central fran@@ ken , there are floors of floors or own homes for only single @-@ standing women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated by men .
&quot; in a study which was published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if privacy or men are absent , men and women can come together to - ongoing - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the shower room should be separated and accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; as much the women felt this protection of this protection , one can read at the And@@ hr@@ ase which there is in Munich &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; since himself has been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could make up a second house easily .
Regist@@ rar : claims to new labour measures
representatives of the assistant doctors have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their dispute relating to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire council from the beginning of September more labour measures .
the J@@ DC said that there had been a minister to concern about the concerns relating to the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance and medical students agreed on the re@@ jection of a contract which has been agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who have voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said that the government had remained very quiet . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and demands the official new negotiations to all E@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has set a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to begin a running programme of escal@@ ating labour , which starts at the beginning of September . &quot;
the disp@@ utes led to the alleged involvement in the N@@ HS &apos;s first total waste in the history of N@@ HS .
&quot; according to the election of the agreed contract conditions , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back to the vote of the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during meetings which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors were forced to be forced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of foreign side &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish turn in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the pur@@ ge , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was nar@@ ro@@ wed , and he scar@@ cely made heat , even for its rest@@ rained conditions . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan said to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report complete five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even better improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have heard that it would never happen . &quot;
&quot; with me , his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling , showed that the Russian President of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the crisis of the crisis was the first that he mentioned in his execution : the agreement of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ ut@@ ted .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back .
&quot; the tre@@ ason was even bigger , as it was committed by a de@@ arest friend . &quot;
the opening again will be difficult when not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a heavy , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed to bear the Turks for everything . &quot;
&quot; on the serious test , the alleg@@ ations of leading officers , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ologies of the Erdo@@ gan President , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire lie clearly on the hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan is primarily needed all the friends who he can get after the last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat .
terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
&quot; Russian sanctions have met Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be facil@@ itated if the flights will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count towards a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the State Wedding Advice on fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again . &quot;
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; tourists there for long , tomatoes here . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is ra@@ ged in the West , as the reaction to the tried power was considered weak response . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , persistent Gro@@ ll come across the EU &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ d to withdraw from the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , Russian President , in Ankara , won a bonus for ensuring that , after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded the support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , not@@ ices a self @-@ intel@@ li@@ gi@@ bility to change regime itself . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , as it once described me an analy@@ st , &quot; alliance of foreign side &quot; : two countries that stum@@ bled from the West and feel bad and now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support other side . &quot;
&quot; it might be noted , that after almost three hours , both President responded to the press conference that they didn &apos;t even hear the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey promised it to answer to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open f@@ en@@ dencies - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , NATO member Turkey shi@@ fted the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland is no longer available
&quot; according to the Bank Management Board , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office role in 2009 . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced himself since eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; in this period , brand str@@ ate@@ ways &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other final consumers . &quot;
&quot; they supported international sports with millions of pounds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from six Nations ru@@ g@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she decided to move more national brands in the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and stock ex@@ changes to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; other brands for private customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be at our investment brand as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we are not a global goals , but pursu@@ ing local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work among these stamps . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its six Nations sponsor@@ ing that it will be able to raise awareness of different brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop at the Bank of brands , for how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the board of directors . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical when we had said that we had to be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think that time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori is achieved on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction its 3.@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him $ 3.@@ 000@@ th profit &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured the British win at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , who is trained by John Gos@@ hen , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ channel winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
&quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here too &quot;
I am very happy about it that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20.000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the Ju@@ bel as he takes the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys reached the milestone in the steep@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ ri@@ er@@ esis &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nity and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone in just a few .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct , which differs him from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma , has been thr@@ illed for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie before several weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already brought 6,000 gains when he was not only a weekend and grand@@ ni@@ z@@ jo@@ ckey would be ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already been around 30 years winner in Britain which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was ner@@ ves .
&quot; a whole range of big tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also lived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulty moving back when he returned from his six months of lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic , to de@@ comp@@ ile its branches and to return to its best . &quot;
and he is not yet a long time at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori had said earlier that he wants to continue with his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin hum@@ bles Chief of Staff Serge@@ ant IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin was un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Sergei IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a few years part of the nar@@ ro@@ est trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is that Putin have arranged the dis@@ miss@@ al of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been with Ivan@@ ov@@ s Deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned state Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the head of the head of the head office and the head of the head . &quot;
he said to Putin : &quot; thanks for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as a state of state to support legislative powers and controls to the implementation of your instructions .
&quot; Putin divided the Russian TV stations on Friday , that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot;
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step is mysteri@@ ously made .
Sergei IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the closest refuge for Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service to K@@ GB .
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returned to his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the le@@ quin for the cameras , here are few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so this is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , wants to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to great scep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said , &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V &quot; , &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - they could say almost four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I &apos;ve been chairman of the Russian President &apos;s Russian President for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; earlier , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ bility Service ( FS@@ B ) , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin arrived to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V could be President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin would viol@@ ate the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken from another , close ally to Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin was prime minister before he became President three and a half years later .
Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he producers
Gibson was involved in a physical debate on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
&quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , pro@@ claiming its resignation in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; Gibson , who played the Special Agent of Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before dis@@ closure of his termination . &quot;

ri@@ ddle about fish that landed in Ban@@ ff &apos;s garden
a inhabitants of Ban@@ ff requested the identification of the fish help which appeared in Ban@@ ff &apos;s garden .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish fishing around San@@ da@@ ale that were sp@@ elled from a fountain of fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of spectac@@ le in hope that someone could throw some light on the release of two inches long fish . &quot;
&quot; Queensland , Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of Queensland , Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four &quot; &quot; Deck@@ blo@@ wers &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 wires . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; on the construction site , Keith Brown hosted a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when construction of the Queensland , Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly ep@@ tical degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the passport . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge of bridge in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks will get a concrete place for the Deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project leader of the For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor , said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter introduces a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter is facing forward @-@ looking high @-@ depth and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after installation of last road covering and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern tip bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; he@@ aters , as the toler@@ ances , which the team works , were tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters . &quot;
luck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have good luck to be alive &quot;
three men have to be &quot; happiness yet alive &quot; after being thrown from their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
&quot; the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved from own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around in her proximity to himself and put us the worst before , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station by Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already raised the boat beyond their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found a Bo@@ je suspended without the life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board of coastal boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine had an emergency stop , however , this dis@@ b@@ ted inside the boat from the person from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has w@@ akes about these men today .
seriously injured - man &apos;s sti@@ fle on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 year old had given the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the non @-@ alcoholic perpet@@ rators the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend instead . &quot;
&quot; when they came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and body .
the police could take the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ ar@@ ous@@ ed his sister as a result .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , she went out from the house with her life . &quot;
&quot; on the road , they met the ex @-@ endangered of the man . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old turned his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green Party : investors should become much stronger in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Bruns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes to the next coun@@ cils &quot; concept of housing . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD Group President Christoph Fr@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; we are happy with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in the future , must show 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be established in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the major dispute in the town hall is , however , viol@@ mann : &quot; how are you about investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such surfaces at least 10 per cent , but possible 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new town@@ house construction programme , which will cost millions , is to be paid for inc@@ enti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as viol@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the Left Party wants to be tou@@ g@@ hness for investors .
&quot; regardless of what , viol@@ mann , ba@@ the the situation of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the concept concept is implemented , and will provide additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; but how is the loss of further 1300 cheap apartments , whose adv@@ ances will run in the next few years ? &quot;
it will be 500 apartments alone by 2020 .
&quot; in order to prevent this , as planned spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased in current bin@@ dings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
on a hit you can solve the problem .
&quot; because in the western city , they are running at the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be returned to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners to residential property companies .
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is dra@@ stically increased , one removes the target of the so @-@ called flow . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few districts is to give it no more .
the Gre@@ ens is estimated that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; commenting on the boat , the Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU has to go into the boat . &quot;
that have been concentr@@ ating on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that there is not yet a compromise .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting trip to health and happiness , which is worthwhile &quot;
&quot; it is fascinating , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; that teenagers and child will not go out to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , to star@@ ve on screens , was be@@ ating in the last decade of many . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is to catch people from the sofa and be more active .
&quot; at first time on the screen , the screen was on TV , then limited to video games and last@@ ly on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I am looking forward to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app which is based on the characters which were created for video games in the 1990s ( later developed a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture fell the interest in the publication of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand , which over@@ loaded the server . &quot;
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone inside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons to be followed with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn und j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; car@@ bide , an app for Apple Watch who followed the 35.000 users , distributed the Washington Post recently , that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it is only the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to bring &quot; &quot; to get 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to get &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active everyday &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring to health and are coming from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be assessed . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to ill cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - motion , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always there are m@@ ür@@ ric game destro@@ yers , which must always be compl@@ ain about anything . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit has already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game . &quot;
&quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will follow the time . &quot;
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nes
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on full line brilliant .
and now Olympic Champion finally .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi @-@ struggle and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt play on the Swedish bar during the individual combined events at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman , who wins a combined campaign and a total of the fifth , while they consoli@@ date its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her end result was shown and her long journey in this moment was an end . &quot;
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es dominated the last three years of its sports race , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she has ever seen the best gym@@ n@@ ast , which I ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expected to be a last examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so very much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a load over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not back with a hand@@ ful gold return to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after they have won gold and silver in the individual combined events of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday while she retired at the farewell party , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi , as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted during their long way@@ mark on the top , never the future is planned , that &apos;s not really true . &quot;
part of their ground exercises - which include the typical Tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would suit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and has been adopted by train@@ erin A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym hall , was used in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competitive competition , a winning series that will stop as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led easily by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ayed . &quot;
Schwe@@ er@@ bal@@ ks and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ert .
she won again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swe@@ be@@ again and sat down with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced them gently when she expected her En@@ der@@ ial - a pure form of form@@ ality , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collection book . &quot;
&quot; the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought around the third place , but the bron@@ chi@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille went in a deep brake to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Mann@@ i chapel , called &apos; O@@ ma &apos; , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her floor , she threw the audience through the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes was dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new significance in the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in series mur@@ derer at the age of music shot in the car
&quot; according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since one decade in the first serial mur@@ derer from Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a ride , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator moist@@ ened eight shots from a hand@@ fire weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side and fled to another vehicle , to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the triple murder could not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , because the att@@ acker did not participate the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators had led the investig@@ ators to become a close view , whether it is connected to four previous att@@ acking . &quot;
&quot; altogether , seven attacks were killed in the Hisp@@ anic neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two more injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to determine the evidence that they have been linked to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was nation@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
&quot; a witness shared the police , that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and to listen to music . &quot;
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting down on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before thre@@ e@@ fold murder and assumed that it was the factory &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to love the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the fe@@ west of his aging , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought I create this . &quot;
I don &apos;t create this .
I didn &apos;t let me let .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund she can never recognize them under the circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors have even so far that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund can run with help of help .
Edmund could neither sit nor sit nor cro@@ oked up to his third year of age . he is still unable to talk .
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language which Edmund for &quot; Please sing to me something &quot; before .
&quot; we bring him drawing language with &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- it says . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
&quot; Micro@@ cephal@@ y has a number of causes : genetic as with Edmund and infections with viruses , such as meas@@ les or the z@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect life with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus in@@ fest@@ ations .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of a bad future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; I didn &apos;t ask for a long time anymore , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the z@@ av@@ irus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
&quot; you will love your child , and your child will love you . &quot;
&quot; heavy rainfall , floods there are life to rescue in Louisiana , Mississippi &quot;
heavy rainfall and large floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned on Saturday throughout the day with more rain@@ falls .
numerous rivers in south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the P@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rain@@ falls reported to the National weather service .
&quot; the governor of Louisiana , John B@@ el Edwards , shared with the local authorities in contact with the local authorities and assistance to the affected communities already on the way . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor , shared with that the in@@ quiries for heavy water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multiplied . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the congregation of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service can be abandoned that there may be an additional 3 to 5 inch of rain in this area .
&quot; in the South of Alabama , a Fl@@ ut@@ early warning system was used on Friday while it was ra@@ ining in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , located both in Louisiana , will reach record level of all probability after the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ ron@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many houses in the subur@@ b of Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ stream @-@ directed flood in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger , because these are only slowly flowing through the rivers of Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; ticket Tick@@ eting , south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached last Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still get people out of the floo@@ ding in the District of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by the glo@@ om on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , is usually located more than 400 feet from his house , over night strong . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step @-@ in , who lives nearby , would have been warned . &quot;
&quot; we wake up and the water flow and out@@ war@@ med , &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where she lived there , never seen such a flood of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck , and they had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; quickly spread &quot; &quot; as it continued heavy rainfall , and that the authorities had to consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a observer was reported close to Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning by 13,@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been substantially absorbed by the rain@@ falls since Wednesday .
the authorities admitted that heavy rainfall and streets flooded the rescue of inhabitants of their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and L@@ oss in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ affiliated channel WW@@ L reported that a conf@@ uses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were both flooded now .
&quot; the pre@@ ste@@ er of the commune of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets , which were caught by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were furnished to lodge the evacu@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; once the water begins to return , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , nearly two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the residents , who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood that we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
&quot; in his pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys told that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a hand@@ ful men should have been reported on Thursday than flooded , but no reported on Friday until now . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I saw water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; ked by balls &quot; , survi@@ ves sh@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified it for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several cast injuries , including in the lungs , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was with its transport to the hospital at consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ chi@@ z . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boys was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boys &apos;s family shared the station with that he is expected to return again .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; at the age of 29 , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable condition . &quot;
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , recorded , reports the transmitter . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not in the car and the police , whether under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators could be found . &quot;
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to be a bon@@ fires between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to different assault ri@@ fle , over@@ se@@ wn the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that it is definitely a lasting fight .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walks were leg@@ umes . &quot;
&quot; here , there seems to have been several armed fighters here , which were very active , &quot; divided police station Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di &apos;s police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several homes and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police currently checks reports , according to surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 year @-@ old girl met by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket at the arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
&quot; they are re@@ covering , and the police searches after a susp@@ ect . &quot;
why do we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the Frauen@@ i@@ am@@ ship in the gym@@ nast@@ ics and that is more than a reason .
&quot; first , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; secondly : this team has three gym@@ n@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired by many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , who is Kath@@ o@@ lic@@ in , round off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has marked the black and h@@ isp@@ anic feminine presence at the top of this sport art .
&quot; over the last four years , the number one among female Tur@@ ner@@ ves was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising event in America and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold medal for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but do not look at gym classes throughout the country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four gym@@ n@@ uns in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like that Tur@@ nen is a more expensive sport and Turner will join the first place in private gy@@ ms that anticip@@ ate parents , travel agents , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
&quot; the majority of these gy@@ ms are in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business . &quot;
&quot; in these verses , the Turner will receive their entire training and this is a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the gym@@ nast@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the municipalities Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easy @-@ to @-@ appro@@ ach@@ able gym training . &quot;
I founded my gym stiftung for 20 years .
&quot; with my events we have free and affordable gym@@ nast@@ ics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and Hisp@@ anic ) as well as national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality Tur@@ ning to learn the opportunity of learning from this great Olympic sports field . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the spirit . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to care for the gym@@ nast@@ ics , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an so exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the wood of the Olympic team and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organise more strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistant doctors who are spac@@ ed with a choice . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that N@@ HS was set up in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be harmful to any other delay for employees and patients . &quot;
the first assistant doctors should have a new contract to improve the changes on night and weekend work to improve care of un@@ certainty times .
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ missions for Assi@@ stance arians shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants have ordered last night in a statement before serious concerns , in particular that it will start the current workforce , and it will be used to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; at only eight weeks , which still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A solution to conduct disp@@ utes by talks during the government to participate and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ ed silence .
&quot; this happened to that , that Jeremy Hunt for the last month had done that his door would always be off@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Hunt has to act now , raise the vibration and speak the concerns of assistance doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he did not do this , he clearly did the assistance systems that they are ready to perform further labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a de@@ formation of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ine@@ ations and 100,000 dates before , because nur@@ ses and doctors were included to grant doctors at the stri@@ k@@ mail cover . &quot;
the ministers hosted the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of the re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association &apos;s functioning of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to be a better week of week@@ days for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures do not achieve anything of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families just concerns , trouble and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we talked to the Department of Assi@@ stance and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries positively to the concerns about the concerns and of the W@@ hist@@ ochem@@ istry . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as disp@@ atch , flexibility for training , training courses , mutual recognition of teaching , training courses , mutual recognition of the teaching schedule , training courses and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day &apos;s prescription that can reduce heart attack risk
&quot; thousands of heart attacks are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 per day medication , after the authorities recommended to date for a longer period of time for a longer period . &quot;
the ger@@ inner medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repet@@ itive heart attack for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , which reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ulations ( N@@ HS ) has been recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ulations ( N@@ HS ) has been recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; each year , around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack and one quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stro@@ kes . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fet@@ thal@@ ate material in the arter@@ ial area .
&quot; when the Bel@@ ag turns out , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the blood flow to the heart , thereby caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ots solves , it can flow through the flow of blood and flow the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
&quot; persons who had already had a heart attack , subject to a higher risk to have another risk . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is exp@@ elled under the commercial name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ prob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the management design of N@@ ICE , which today has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE Health @-@ echn@@ ology Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack or stro@@ kes - often with des@@ ast@@ r@@ ous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of one person .
&quot; the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in the reduction of other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people , who had already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand , available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the introduc@@ tory design does not support treatment that proceeds over this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness continues to flour@@ ish in Muslim Brotherhood
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for corruption from the Office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led the widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities like a devastating government report .
&quot; the former cabin of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber , to have evidence of electoral abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption sc@@ andal , said that the police should be allowed to set out of elec@@ ting voters outside of elec@@ tr@@ ines to be in@@ timi@@ dated voters outside . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have a identification with themselves , to prove their identity . &quot;
at present a elec@@ tor must only call his name and address .
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person , if they release their voting voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to community records and decisions of non @-@ official com@@ ings or working groups .
&quot; it is not only possible against electoral fraud , but also the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and finance culture that goes down to protecting , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year a special tribunal decided that the am@@ ig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was given to a lit@@ igation on corrupt and illegal practices of his nurse .
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ n@@ ical way , and that he would have brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; his campaign is to have &quot; his campaign based on the basis , that it is the cor@@ related duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either desper@@ ate or a consequence of a desc@@ endant , by which one person cho@@ oses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric told that there were evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ code , where older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the voting system , including the ant@@ enn@@ as to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; as proof that pressure was administered on non @-@ governmental members of some ethnic min@@ orities , in particular women and young people to choose the welcome of the elder , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ quet background . &quot;
there was concerns that ... state institutions would have ignored such a behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; sensiti@@ v@@ ities regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists are editing , to stop &quot; election harvest . &quot; &quot;
the report published by Ther@@ esa may also demands harder registration checks to prevent the electoral directory for immigration and social security purposes .
&quot; consider options , select voters before choosing your identification . &quot;
&quot; do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she gave her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are entitled .
a three @-@ year @-@ old limitation on an automatic post@@ code .
prohibition that political activists work complete correspondence and envel@@ opes of correspondence .
&quot; the police force the fug@@ ing , setting off charges for election stations . &quot;
a amendment to the Prosecutor of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) facil@@ it@@ ates an amendment to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
photographer banned in election stations .
requirement that only English should be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that employees take a rule out that voters want to go into the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; aston@@ ish@@ ingly &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the election court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , due to a lit@@ igation on corrupt and illegal practices than un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high demands on the basis of the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; abras@@ ive control &quot; of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Jud@@ gment in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country contributes as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and le@@ aning of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ doubles and other famous Doppel@@ gänger by Olympic Port in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are present this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band that proved to be an impressive double of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ic@@ in is not the only one to fight for gold batt@@ ling athl@@ ete who has his own famous doubles - at least not if you give the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Rio Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces , which are running for time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ ies that feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood films . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the Wolf : team member of the US crew in the ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates double @-@ viol@@ inist on the bicycle race , many people were on the internet that could be a certain arch@@ ers of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
the team member of the US crew in the ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures where he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star in@@ secretly .
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave it to hear that he had already heard about his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; divided Bra@@ dy from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become more in the focus : the elabor@@ ating simil@@ arity between British broad@@ cast@@ ings Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
&quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes are supposed to pass through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan . &quot;
and in the swimming pool is compared to the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh for years with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alists in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ fried skin and pale hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter Ac@@ t@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about that others also liked the simil@@ ar@@ ities
theory in the room : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
a Twitter u@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
in fact the US football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , who has its own beautiful , wide smile , which resem@@ bles that of Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the Canadian transmitter C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of his comm@@ ent@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer went &quot; like M@@ ief , &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Byron Mac@@ don@@ ald thought that his microphone was switched off , when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the commentary team of C@@ BS on board , could hear more &quot; color , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this small 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , he went like a pig , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second leg of the swimming st@@ aff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible to close the gap to China . &quot;

&quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Did the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer came out of China &quot; like a pig dead &quot; ? ? ? ?

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free style swimming pool for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , when they found him many . &quot;
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you only represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who plays the C@@ BC broadcast live , live live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming power station . &quot;
&quot; it was a un@@ fortunate formulation , we &apos;re sorry that it is happening . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of over 90 times by the people who responded to the Not@@ ification of Twitter &quot;
the commentary volume Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his debt to more than 90 other Twitter users , who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments &quot;
the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed fast and gave a message .
&quot; we regret it correctly , that these statements were made and that it was possible to show that they are broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed at our spectators on the show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to create one , Byron &apos;s comments are related to the performance of a s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on her than person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ adequ@@ ately and a un@@ fortunate formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was not designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment for me to exc@@ use me for the comment , whom I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I found myself in the performance of a s@@ wimm@@ ers , not included in them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , there was no contemp@@ t , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trage over woman who have sh@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of business
&quot; the buyer did not know where they should see , when a woman drew her clothing in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try shelter . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked like her in her , and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued and tried four pairs of sub@@ cut@@ ters in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in whom the woman tried the under@@ wear before they put it back to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the store , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she left again and left the business without buying something . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the retail space , they took a pair of sub@@ s from the out@@ lay , moved their own shr@@ ubs and tro@@ users and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she wasn &apos;t even trying to find a little discreet place to do it , it simply was there , looking like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ ed when they pulled back the sau@@ cer , which you did not like it , because they put it back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other sub@@ divisions , before they finally decided that you did not liked it , and went out again . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b any one observed , or think about the person who would buy the shelter under the circumstances which she tried . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how do you think that someone would take shelter with home that had an other person , and that were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I &apos;ve got , the employees tried to pull the pieces of clothes from the sale , after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sub@@ ways to go home and find out that another woman had touched her , and was not washed away . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that happened on Tuesday 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a little safer .
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed groups . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front , or from behind , this video will show you how you turn the sk@@ e@@ wers for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you check out from behind , then you should turn to the up@@ side , so you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and go out of the line @-@ line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
seize the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bows .
&quot; then beat him with the knees into the body and rotate , while the att@@ ack@@ ers hit pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move backward , while they set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technology is similar - move your body from the cast line , take the weapon and rotate it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , lay the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the breast , then turn the weapon out of its handle , before they move backward and set the weapon . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ macy .

travelling Ian Wright for a travel guide his tongue at the dirty places of Europe
a British travel joint vent@@ ured his immune system and throws a serious test - by removing some of the most dirty and ec@@ cent@@ est places of Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k with@@ drew its course on a euro notes , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a washing head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before filling each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer , to show and show us what he will let . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , titled &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was filmed , brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought that fl@@ ashing up a draw toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely sho@@ ck@@ proof , but in fact , in a kitchen don@@ ate more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists on promoting intestinal bacteria and its own health . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , nothing left behind him , which he refused , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by moving through the world , and ate pec@@ uli@@ ar and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public rail@@ ways to railway stations up to the washing of toilets , the task set up his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and sle@@ dge water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was justified in his call . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ ofing showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number is freshly washed hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse , after its L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res of more than 4000 units , while fresh washed hands are less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of places in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will not touch here because it is inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers really something new . &quot;
something that &apos;s fascinating about watching and at the same time the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics explains .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings that ended with that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense for humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film &apos;s direction , added : &quot; let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him , like the ec@@ lipse of Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to put them up and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we have some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
&quot; in a survey conducted by the survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents performed in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent reported that they also contain at least occasionally products that included l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ og@@ ation in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ oci@@ al family left their social residence after a delay of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after having been violent from their property , the property acquired the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls sh@@ utt@@ led holes on the wooden floors were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti became the walls lubri@@ cated . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed to live now in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears that the apartment is no longer repair . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t need to live in this way .
there are many things to consider because this estate is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror who had had the family had to be added , in@@ timi@@ date of residents , drug abuse , drug dealers and excessive scre@@ ams , strings and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease contract , got an arrangement of anti @-@ iso@@ cial behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which is torn down under circumstances , an old tr@@ ash was found . &quot;
&quot; in the estate where in the past , drugs have been acted , the wooden poles &quot;
&quot; neighbours said they had to fight them on the street , and regularly called the police . &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner for this week violent from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to get voluntarily .
&quot; the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors , saying that their lives were made to hell . &quot;
one said : &quot; they were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say to the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used here !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had been working with the local authorities to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , called the police in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
on the over@@ turned side of the house were rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that there is a dis@@ grace to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
that was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be terrible for her neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church , who have gone cour@@ ageous for us and have dealt with us the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbors , and communic@@ ating the message that ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour will not be toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all were over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirt mattress , which is left back in one of the bedroom of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the floor . &quot;
workers of the house administration will now need to remove garbage collection that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and took over 70@@ g cannabis and scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine @-@ penalty after she was found guilty of a threat of a threat of class B .
&quot; she claimed that the money came for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who was about life at a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ led with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will say rent@@ ers , not to keep the assignment of the house . &quot;
Angela Cro@@ w sent by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall that Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who does not keep themselves to the assignment .
&quot; this goes to those who think they may behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as to those who were damaged by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ iso@@ cial behaviour , which continued to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ tremendous problems ″ in election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states of their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave birth to weakness of his election campaign in the former Republican Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which normally a large @-@ track and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire l@@ ately expressed as concerns how correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 rival within the race camp from the race , the doubts grow at its success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for assistance in major states like Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he accepted his well @-@ known media reports . &quot;
republi@@ can sky@@ rock@@ ets w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June @-@ June , Tr@@ ump and its compet@@ itor were expressed by the Democrats , Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state . &quot;
as endangered are both Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question how he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ t again : &quot; just as I have made it so far . &quot;
&quot; and if it be back : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he will do nothing else than &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich in order for him on the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it was fine , said Tr@@ ump further . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump should be threatened to strike funds for the support of his election campaign , he should not present a better change values . &quot;
&quot; instead of its wool , the candidates for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans take stronger than the arms . &quot;
Olympia : three Sc@@ am Sc@@ am at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IOC wants to set up a disciplines of a disciplines .
Ken@@ yan athletes threatened after the second D@@ oping @-@ Aff@@ air in Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
&quot; after an attempt attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee , in order to interv@@ ene promp@@ tly to establish a Nazi commission in order to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary informed that the former Sprinter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village was given a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this was the team lead Ken@@ an by D@@ oping @-@ Controll@@ le@@ urs .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IOC information about the case in order to strict their own studies , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation &quot; , &quot; it was named in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping control station , and has spent itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample delivered and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who stood on the list of training courses in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was born in Beijing in 2015 in Beijing World Championship for more than 800 meters .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ i had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics . &quot;
he should be informed of the D@@ oping @-@ Tests in his country about upcoming D@@ oping tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he should be arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , Kenya has been under special observation with the IOC to numerous D@@ oping connections . &quot;
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio Olympics , it has been noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia was taken into visa . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exercised much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia Beg@@ inning .
&quot; consequently , WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose D@@ oping control conform to the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won the world &apos;s most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports the ARD has always been charged , that in Kenya &apos;s D@@ oping means easily accessible and there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a result , IOC member Richard Po@@ und performed similar examination in Kenya as he worked in the Russian Athle@@ tics Championships . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could be demonstrated that this sport is nationwide and systematically distribution . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes have been excluded from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger Story &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of the classic and fulfilled himself with the role of Mary a youth mare .
&quot; in the orchestra , Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezuel@@ an orchestra Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he has war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and mel@@ ody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older than Maria . &quot;
she remembers her loving kindness with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first because it &apos;s extraordinary !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I have been Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I , Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so , it is smart , of course also na@@ ive , and very passi@@ on@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I used as Roman &apos; , laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honor to work with her .
she is a monster of generous humans .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli are the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is as an extraordinary artist , very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
&quot; you see it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; today , we have walked the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ness went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; these are the same topics , and today they are just as meaningful as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;

&quot; in February 2015 , s@@ ult@@ ana and two other school maid came from the east of London into a plane towards Turkey and subsequently transferred to a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate , Hillary Clinton will nomin@@ ate Mer@@ rick Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands confirmation since his nomin@@ ation by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mitch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is the opinion that the next president will be the successor to Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty .

&quot; he praised Gar@@ land , and said , Clin@@ t Team would not take care of ag@@ itation with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .

Tre@@ ats wants N@@ eck calendar for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere together to release a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Chief Editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year , that his neck magazine of Old@@ school players might be distingu@@ ish@@ able as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot; &quot;
I make it for women .
&quot; apparently , he &apos;s the opinion that it does the Calendar . &quot;
&quot; we have to return to the representation of contemporary and classical n@@ ack@@ ness , in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the publication of the Cal@@ endars . &quot;
women will participate in this project because it &apos;s a wonderful work of art .

Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; whoever does not fit and praise the Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the end of the G@@ ülen @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short notice , the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection seek@@ ers who escaped from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , there could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish congregation of Germany expects a mass cur@@ ses to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short term , I reck@@ oned with tens of thousands of thousands in medium @-@ term with some hundred thousand prot@@ ru@@ ding from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fought the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the &quot; World Top@@ ra@@ k of the World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already passed Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ alties , 500,000 Kurds are on the run within Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the p@@ utsch of the coup , sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to re @-@ start in Europe if they will continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refuge in the own country , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of Staff denied the targeted accus@@ ation of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities . &quot;
&quot; hence , Erdo@@ gan is raising the exit to the remaining Kurds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been wi@@ ped out or distributed in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of Staff demanded that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria , against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot;
&quot; also in Germany , a &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics . &quot;
I feel uns@@ afe in Germany last months for the first time .
the German branch of the G@@ ülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks are searching for asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and Oppos@@ ition@@ ist . &quot;
the fire market as G@@ ülen pendant was destroyed by teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics .
&quot; who pra@@ ises not an@@ cho@@ red and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the G@@ ülen @-@ Middle Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already introduced the largest group of asylum authorized asylum in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all over the world have been justified ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , you will not find the war , poverty or car@@ el@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the basic law are solely politically , thus by state @-@ government , individually followed . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
&quot; Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als are not allowed to choose from the summer campaign , and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the country tag . &quot;
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; in 2005 , the country code will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the sword will already be decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because it is not so far as to date : summer holidays , heat and country skiing struggle - that bit@@ es itself . &quot;
the loc@@ als that are to be convinced of the election battles are on holiday .
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not allowed to choose the country . &quot;
&quot; practical issues come : in the holidays they are hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , fl@@ yers and fill out the end of the votes , only tired . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to be over to pass on the people beyond the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can tell it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , which has been the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition rush remains . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 66 , Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one sees from his major posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the land , spread the ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as it was already his legendary singer Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has gotten cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel guilty on the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , you &quot; We create , &quot; I have accelerated the ascent of the sp@@ op@@ o@@ ists , which is probably going to cost him right now . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place at the right place election campaign . &quot;
she has been invited twice to German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s federal circuit lies in the Nor@@ theast .
&quot; the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , Vincent co@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CDU ren@@ ounces market conditions on market areas and before shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; that , as Kok@@ o , doesn &apos;t mean a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noticed that , on the country , the base has to crum@@ ble that it must be very strict to find a wire again for the people . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the area of the country hardly exists . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CDU campaign in Kok@@ ert to his fellow soldier is , however , to go out where it is we@@ ary , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much has been on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated electoral struggle . &quot;
&quot; in the p@@ olls , the Social Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ eng@@ ages ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD still had 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will be able to make the leap into the land . &quot;
&quot; they are making a modern virtu@@ e from the holidays , and lay down their electoral struggle on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; online campaign &quot; , &quot; says the National President Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green electoral fighting for pet@@ ition@@ ing to local vote among the vac@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top @-@ edge , cur@@ v@@ t with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ash lakes and finds it nice too . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : guest restaurants suffer from lock
&quot; on the speed , with which the B 27 is gentle , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; to begin work of the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , and only around 20 o &apos;clock , there are omni@@ pot@@ ent praise . &quot;
&quot; they made all very delicate , &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the Jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
&quot; at the beginning of October , the construction site could be moved to the south , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; is also the purpose of the work responsible for the construction work , for example if it is about the establishment of heating drives . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site arrived on Monday to the south , and also the lock of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has also been relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now go on both sides of O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the so@@ fter traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the representative General Manager of the Re@@ furb@@ ishment General Manager Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the natives of Bach@@ le@@ road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many scar@@ ves were seeking and rather its Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what did it lead to man@@ cher trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as well as the speed limits were not observed , the community called the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable excess , &quot; says King that made himself a spot on the location . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 hour kilometers in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that the road from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but the B 27 renovation of them has led to them in revenues , everyone who asks you to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for which the restoration has barely consequences . &quot;
&quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight drop , &quot; but also a result that of course , &quot; the lear@@ ance of course is missing . &quot;
&quot; on the most , the local runs along the road . &quot;
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , propriet@@ or of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , finds considerable words . &quot;
that is already exist@@ ential .
not only him but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; they were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro .
&quot; on &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
road plans have thrown his operation &quot; for two years . &quot;
he has to release half of his associates .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees , and half would have been released , the policy would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öhn@@ er , if there could be a financial compensation otherwise , the restaurant prof@@ iti@@ ves otherwise by the advantages of the location on the B . now she must also bear the draw@@ backs , which bring itself through the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; he knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous has been . &quot;
&quot; at all Kl@@ agen , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his restaurant will pass on . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been located since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests can now understand less often due to the complicated traffic @-@ leadership , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t go down , it is also elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the restoration work , G@@ öhn@@ er has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öhn@@ er holds the effects of the B 27 construction work to its clientele for the largest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ term history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; ever , in the name of terror , laws will be weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; following the recent proposals , the Minister for the Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a stat@@ ute status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partners say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all its proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Interior Minister at the presentation of his new security team . &quot;
they are demanding anyone .
&quot; other , further points would be discussed first within the parties . &quot;
I also bet@@ wi@@ red me too .
&quot; however , Minister for Interior , however , be on results and an &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has given a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before he presented his conclusions for safety in the republic .
but this is all the more extensive .
&quot; some is known , announced that a new security authority to take care of the push @-@ in communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; even the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU direc@@ tives and arms legislation , too . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities are also not surprising .
&quot; for part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second start for proposals that had not been to do with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ ies for terror groups under sentence and jihadists with double citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; the CDU man grants . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still can do this for reasonable and demanding nothing , which have no chances during the coalition partners . &quot;
a few new ideas will be presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they are partially in themselves : he plans for deportation and more possibilities for detention of people in front of deportation .
&quot; refugees , who are targeted in the country , should check out their smartphone and check social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; for asylum seek@@ ers for ab@@ orted asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to have some worse than ever - such as such as offen@@ ders or refuse their papers to make their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legal .
some also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and at some point - at the im@@ balance of growth of thought , for example - the question arises : what has it actually done with safety and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to imagine that the terrorist attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people in view of the high refugee numbers are concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that are affected by people , now didn &apos;t let themselves out in election campaign . &quot;
the inner safety is enorm@@ ously decorated in the focus .
&quot; the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nizza . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the failure is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election struggle . &quot;
&quot; Union and SPD focus on inner safety , therefore increasingly in position . &quot;
during the last days it was high between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ n@@ ical dispute over the facilities of the Federal Police , then via a safer ideas collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the Ress@@ ch@@ efs also require a bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also available here to reconc@@ ile sounds .
from a return from a double pass it doesn &apos;t get anything .
we are satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; you will be re@@ thinking , be not sensible . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he un@@ constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partners .
there is quite a lot of things to worry about .
&quot; however , the SPD currently tries to pro@@ filing itself on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; the party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes in a careful conversation and says , &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes further , to increase safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still moving through .
&quot; despite diesel engines , the delivery pay amounts worldwide . &quot;
but it is not running in all markets .
&quot; at the return response , there are vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e for a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start with the deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest coach can continue to provide an increase in the previous years . &quot;
&quot; however , in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened primarily in Western Europe and thus loaded the whole sale , as it had been recorded in Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand sold at 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars in July with a 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; sales in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost a sixth century . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s brand sales team led the weaker numbers from July , primarily on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , it was given a purchase back in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the exit from the EU also bur@@ dened as a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where exhaust gases are first escal@@ ated , there is also a Min@@ us to be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony continues to go through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus of 0.9 percent is at 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
consolidated Prime Minister Fred Kap@@ pler from January to July continued to introduce a sales plan from January to July .
&quot; in this period , Volkswagen delivered more than 1.3 percent in this period to 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software package .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls for approximately 2.5 million vehicles to re@@ upgrade into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW , re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of cars did not have negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the retro@@ fitting of vehicles , it is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the bus station , according to the retro@@ fitting a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but speak not of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate circles . &quot;
reason for legal tra@@ ine@@ qualities .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted to its German customers , now a guarantee for dual diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs last Monday .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has completed the requirements of my investig@@ ating commission , and the KBA process . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after conversion no more deterior@@ ations and all the relevant vehicle data will remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate circles .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; Volkswagen , Volkswagen provides the opportunity for example a half year after the conversion to a car damage to a workshop - and this could bring back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do so . &quot;
&quot; also in Customer Inter@@ est , it is important to avoid that there is nothing to do with the sc@@ andal that is nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , as it was called . &quot;
therefore VW use the term &quot; warranty &quot; not .
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires a criminal prosecution in the future as the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; chief of Joseph Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; It is only about 139 customers that par@@ ked 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily money . &quot;
the German banks of German banks speaks of a single fall and does not see a signal : normal spar@@ es would not be afraid to pay for their austerity prisoners .
&quot; store money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay a 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund from September to private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on g@@ ro@@ - or daily balance . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; it ke@@ epers 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the others and could not be understood . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the banker . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay € 4,000 for each one million . &quot;
the costs he continued after the auction principle .
&quot; the cash is easy to leave in the t@@ res@@ res of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed on other investment platforms .
only a few walk to other banks .
&quot; Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , be &quot; economically permanently possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; therefore , some German banks have increased their fees for credit cards , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with charges of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive director of the banking sector , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect that private customers need to pay for deposits , in addition , the competition in Germany is too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a banker has said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cliff that is rich in wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bench , if they ski@@ pped for free money . &quot;
&quot; the G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach E@@ ver , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; popular actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the cooperative society in Bavaria , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June , President of the Federal Association of German People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ üt@@ z ( BvR ) , Uwe Frö@@ hlich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to the negatives is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard , and it imp@@ lies the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not like to please this in the width .
destination records : who actually buys sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men love middle ages .
&quot; before you go to the comment , in order to transfer him under the p@@ seudonym &quot; Non@@ le@@ vel@@ v@@ ety @-@ age , &quot; this statement is deri@@ ving from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ go@@ v , the resur@@ gence of sound plates is not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the unity of physical objects , but due to mid @-@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all pre@@ views after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group . &quot;
it is also not a Hor@@ ses through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older flat buyers maintain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would follow a news report on TV , I would follow me the camera , while I am in the midst of a bust@@ ling street in So@@ ho run , I keep my hands and defin@@ ing something like : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart is so@@ wn slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now , the buildings in which once independent seller have been based - is there a hand@@ ful of fantastic turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman probably to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in immediate proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate your age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I received from Sister Ray ( data of data : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such si@@ zable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy plates that he had appeared and again to buy items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought to buy something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
that is my L@@ aster .
&quot; We@@ z , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets the You@@ go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about com@@ eback and to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations , which I have led , people usually have ended up in 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to App@@ endi@@ ces of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record shops offers a relaxing community of equ@@ alis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and would like to keep moving out to stability of familiar sound hard drives , objects of objects , happy youth groups . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s so many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff from a flat stack .
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , did not hear it yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; at that time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I bl@@ oss@@ essed a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ ig@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data of data : three men mean age ) has realized a &quot; tro@@ phy effect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone got up recently here and said , &quot; I have no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radio record , so I &apos;d like to put them into the shelf . &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ kl@@ ist . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; there are younger people , not elderly , which are only slow . &quot;
&quot; f@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ low@@ ly audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , Teen@@ age and Women &apos;s middle ages . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ - and Ex@@ am@@ orous Pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ills from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but brand @-@ psychological trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be fixed , if you stand for another 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , runs for some minutes in the shop and consider the variety of plates for sale . &quot;
she looks more a man@@ ne@@ bul@@ lock than a big buy .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore , collecting records are not real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or another way but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ arest plague .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the suggest@@ ion to mu@@ g the je@@ ans hot@@ spot , I observe a group of young girls who group@@ ed for a moment by pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Cro@@ sley table players . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of no@@ bles by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks at it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and to send some customers into the depths of So@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research research shows that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they let at least in record shops in So@@ ho , the great number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en . &quot;
these people are probably working hard in school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security out of plates of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while she fl@@ atter the star@@ ing view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of the middle age . &quot;

French Court ref@@ uses offering demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French Court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees are living . &quot;
&quot; during a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the government should have to settle for 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ tive businesses , where people offer temporary stores or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places would be torn down , because they would represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid out of tax and fire risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that were supported by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups , do not offer enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they led out that the provisional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who would operate the 72 provisional transactions , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as merely people live to live in extremely pre@@ valent conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas are quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the rain@@ bow was the Jungle Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is non @-@ profit @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice to asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of protection needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;

despite the Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fierce fighting
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting appearance in the olymp@@ ic period , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin will not have to refra@@ in . &quot;
&quot; I keep the World Cup at a glance , stay confident and fighting , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Thursday . &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar hat .
&quot; it really seems to be honest , the time to comment from yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must analyse to analyse what reasons for de@@ ac@@ el had led .
&quot; at the time the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will see everything that we have changed in the last time .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser needs to be set to the next generation of speed@@ ometers : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , which are particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ ur@@ istic effective en@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example of accident points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to san@@ iti@@ zation with temporary temp@@ o , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary Bl@@ itzer for the adher@@ ence to the limit limit . &quot;
but a permanent mobile set can be too dangerous or complex .
&quot; the en@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : its battery lasts for five days , the case data is transmitted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously via several tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limit , as well as transit verb@@ s to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also monitor . &quot;
&quot; in the highly frequ@@ ented condition , one can move the tra@@ ilers according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to shock , it is lowered to the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and also the safe outer sleeve will disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzer to V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and meanwhile also used . &quot;
&quot; there are also foreign authorities with the new technique : recently , France has re@@ ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; great Britain capture silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ eper stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in Fiji , Fiji divided a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , desc@@ ending , line @-@ run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic ame@@ da@@ ille of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was failed by the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth in this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the bo@@ k , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals at the same day could fall on them in the final . &quot;
but in this form we had beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
&quot; it could be a comfort for GB , but it will probably not - that at least it will be a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Head trainer Ben Ryan , former boss for England . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game with the Adelaide Sev@@ ens . &quot;
they only lost one here .
&quot; this sli@@ d will we@@ ave , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
&quot; in Fiji , the attacks began to be worn out of fun . &quot;
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run as if one would run in driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
&quot; with another four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly been attached to the ball .
&quot; a he@@ ge@@ aring t@@ int of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann @-@ Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped in Fiji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a entered the right corner a touch down , and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ p@@ added and there was still over a minute of season ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ten@@ dered by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , when Fiji was born to play 7 , while GB has still existed . &quot;
it is so .
&quot; GB introduced major changes to the half time , and completed the fic@@ tional gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game was already in favour of the South Sea cons@@ ulate , whose fans sang , fa@@ xes and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff heard that Fi@@ j@@ is re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished and the GB k@@ ic@@ iled cr@@ ushing into the grass .
&quot; earlier in the days , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK urged South Africa in a scar@@ ce sem@@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in front of the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on passed the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the Train@@ ers
there will be no engine of engine than with these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder up to the last , 220 hard h@@ ie@@ ve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if it were only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ am , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympics in a row without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports that laid out such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter is un@@ used , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ es , who lead over the surface with the elegance of vibration , which is not reflected the way of the Tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on to give off the difference , which make the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who would not survive this day when cancer was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able , and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could be the treatment early 2014 , outside the season , which the inter@@ ruption was kept on a minimum , if that is the correct term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was a inc@@ entive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
so it begins .
&quot; the rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ fertility of the victory , their first thoughts were on Williams , who spent a ner@@ ves morning to talk a little more than otherwise , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning that was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in an action in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is only repeatedly how much to me that , how much I and Helen and Robin worked on . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with whom their opponents could not succeed . &quot;
&quot; even over the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark would close up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of itself .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to make something special .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want to work there today , we simply wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympics . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exempl@@ ary for clarity of 31 years
&quot; the manager of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ eins &quot; group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian &quot; well @-@ exempl@@ ary .
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
this was the name of some time in the original paper in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
&quot; a little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia ended the purpose . &quot;
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ated group &quot; Bavarian &quot; is regarded as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zwe@@ ck@@ age group , 28 years ago as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with approximately 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the churches of Kirch@@ ema , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water suppliers for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chair , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Civil Championship in Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ ühl ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was dis@@ continued as a water @-@ keeper and was appointed Chief Executive Board in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extended from the water management and maintenance work on office and maintenance work , the bud@@ get@@ ary creation , calculation of charges and contributions to emergency posts at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land@@ marks in the area of the new foun@@ tains ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of a central computer controlled ( in 2004 ) and the upgra@@ ding of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and I have always taken new improvements because of water , and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ re@@ atio , she praised the faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he used himself with a lot of cor@@ di@@ spar@@ ut for his water purpose and he has been living with the water@@ pro@@ se association , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he considered a real practition@@ er to present the success of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein Group to the nit@@ rate of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the other hand , praised water to Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best water and he was a faithful mate .
&quot; together , we were an unbe@@ atable team . &quot;
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ n@@ construction and the re@@ structure of the purpose . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ pel@@ let at the head of Kirch@@ ema on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; at minus 17 degrees we had to work through the whole night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
the supply of Neu@@ brunn was also able to cover it once more because one filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with strap .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter that joins the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko is open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago around - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it .
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , they believed that they should die . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the eigh@@ ty @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has come well and learn privately in New York , where the best therap@@ ists give . &quot;
&quot; for example , if I ask him something that is back two years when I sang at the Milan Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; &quot; Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko said . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man is shooting for life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man born on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and wounded them fatal .
&quot; the man called himself called us and indicated that his lifetime companion was shot , &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators may be on the run , according to him I will be publicly ch@@ ased . &quot;
by now Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a gl@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
meanwhile the police has published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man carries a Gl@@ at@@ ze .
man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could carry the weapon with themselves , so the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the year 1988 , the perpet@@ rators 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make no data for the T@@ ather@@ gang , or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a human being killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a de@@ hydr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; we do not say more , &quot; said a polic@@ eman woman in Lübeck . &quot;
according to the eye witness there was a special customer service ( SEK ) at the crime scene .
steel - light view for German steel industry
the cra@@ cked and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ affected by additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which are threatened by the industry , are threatened by the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains during the liberation from the renewable energy conversion to the so @-@ called egg @-@ energy production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ German General Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission initially planned , the steel producer , which use gases from the high @-@ furnace for electricity generation to be used for consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ as well as a share agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when generators be replaced in the steel plants , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 per cent fall . &quot;
but this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement with Germany &apos;s agreement with the EU Commission to promote your own generation .
&quot; thus , the status Quo of the current regulation will largely be fixed . &quot;
special meaning have the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; IG Metall Group CEO Jörg Hofmann , in Frankfurt , also stated with the reform of the emission standard . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation further intensi@@ fied when the world &apos;s largest producer in China fell heavily on the global market in view of the weak@@ ened domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel concerts pri@@ d@@ umping .
&quot; over this spring , the situation has slightly relaxed . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a show , import tari@@ ffs on imp@@ orter effect , for the other , economic prospects have emerged in China . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained carefully on Thursday .
at last the prices have stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to last but not exclu@@ de closure of single works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a well of six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month as the economic activity had been announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the amount brought back to the second month after a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been set by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
the association reck@@ ons within the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing doing Senior Citi@@ zens &quot;
&quot; the S@@ ingen has accompanied her entire life : as a young girl she was in the choir as a young girl , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a seniors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a sample , they feel balanced , joy@@ ful and overall , she says . &quot;
&quot; very next , they do something good in their health and mind . &quot;
&quot; because S@@ ingen is a great hobby for seniors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German Cancer League . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; by regular mer@@ ging , senior social contacts can connect and maintain . &quot;
&quot; because often , social and famili@@ al structures of the age are frequently solved , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also been part of Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to arrange and organize and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cl@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; singing can sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler writes . &quot;
a deep and controlled re@@ spiration will exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; those who calls his lung regularly , as well as in everyday life , not so fast from the pu@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; even if it comes to get the sound of voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the German Labour community of seniors @-@ organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and leisure time . &quot;
L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people are many memories often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
&quot; through Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies , people de@@ compos@@ es itself to long past events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , a special performance is required , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on the own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially elderly people , who live alone , do not only practice themselves on itself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one finds through the singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler writes . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing by singing in choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I do long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , do not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , says L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you do not sing alone - with 50 singing people , who ever hears a sound next ? &quot;
&quot; searching for the appropriate offer , Senior Citi@@ zens offers various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; someone sings out of the acquain@@ t@@ orial circle in a senior chain , you can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn right to the church or church leaders . &quot;
many senior professionals can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the internet , your family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; whoever lust has to sing , should necessarily connect to a choir , advis@@ es h@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely than cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover which effect the rowing of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the male also didn &apos;t get cold - however , they still beha@@ ved in the difference to the females . &quot;
female cats may recognize the rain level of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the che@@ wing of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster at Lau@@ te von K@@ itt@@ ens , who would be found in great distress , as Scienti@@ sts found by the veter@@ inary School and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; tom@@ cat also react on the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always equal . &quot;
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acoustic differences between the che@@ wing of less and heavy rain for the males are either un@@ acceptable or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said by the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is the first director of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams were different with the drums of their help .
a total of nine adults and eight cav@@ ities were observed from the animal housing of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a break of little ones , which were taken away for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in addition to others , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were also lifted up . &quot;
researchers keep their results despite the low sample for sa@@ vi@@ ously .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster for speaker , when this calls were played by the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;

Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey takes place an important football match again . &quot;
&quot; before Du@@ eling of the Erz@@ riv@@ eting , Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul at the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is predicted . &quot;
&quot; during the suspension of acceptance after the crash attempt in July , the government , the daily life of standardi@@ zation should not be imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
it will not be done before the football team .
an arrest warrant issued against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
&quot; accordingly , in America , Sü@@ k@@ r is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ k@@ r is to be the followers of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although it is true for 90 days , the state of emergency was still valid until October , in fact , that on the life of most Turks , however , does not affect the life of the Turks . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public squares throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for Wednesday .
the sport is - like all the country - split in tra@@ ilers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
&quot; but in the history of the Turks , but in view of dramatic experiences in the history , the strict re@@ jection of military coup is rejected . &quot;
there are even the fans themselves - no matter whether their heart beat Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ victorious &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be held especially on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; its sporty value , the Cologne in the past season is proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the final play against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored a 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; lam@@ ented him : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he finished the season outstanding in the season and secured the tro@@ phy in his team .
&quot; thanks to Pol@@ di , the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master found a reconc@@ ile end . &quot;
&quot; after the conclu@@ ding K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; went out early in the Europe League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was only enough to place six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game was better . &quot;
&quot; most of all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who went with 26 season season as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ go@@ os@@ cop@@ es laid the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the AC @-@ Florence , under the contract , and Bes@@ ik@@ tas had announced only to the coup attempt , due to the political situation in the country after its European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the Stür@@ mer should be willing to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of its estimated annual sal@@ aries on 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; his salary at Florence may not pay . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athl@@ ets are still medals @-@ chances of Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year old Justin Gat@@ lin was locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
other Athle@@ tics Men can only laugh about it - they &apos;re fighting in Rio around medals .
the topic d@@ oping is determined according to the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics Games .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had lam@@ ented their start just before the games , was wi@@ ped out and hat@@ ched at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
it was a sc@@ r@@ ile scene : with a pres@@ sur@@ ised smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked with their appearance .
&quot; when it was fixed , that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a sm@@ ub@@ el@@ tower . &quot;
but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the Rio Olympics in spite of the D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , the 2004 Olympic champion in 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world championship had to be sitting in 2010 after taking the pain in Oxy@@ co@@ don &apos;s pain . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had a strong tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion in 2013 and European Championship has been positively tested to the prohibited stim@@ uli @-@ funds meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ crimin@@ als and was imprisoned six months .
the four broad@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite .
&quot; La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two times world champion over 400 m , has been positive and 21 months in 2010 . &quot;
a means to increase penis enlargement may have been responsible .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ete were recognized so many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after it was diagnosed with him testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and EM title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; this also recognised bron@@ chi@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille of the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a verdict of the CA@@ S International Court of Justice . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked number two of the world ranking .
&quot; Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold@@ fav@@ it@@ in was only tested in May , but must still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship , indications have been found on taking an banned dietary supplements , the sperm of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA came out and ran on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - more dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday . &quot;
&quot; it had suffered pr@@ ams and have been treated in hospital , but I have already left this again . &quot;
her hom@@ ebo@@ und voyage was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ island Phu@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs insi@@ sts in contact with the local authorities , such as liqu@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai regime has been killed and about 20 people were injured , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went high , and in the course of the authorities a further man was killed . &quot;
&quot; also from Phu@@ ket , a bomb explosion was also reported in the morning . &quot;
during the Det@@ onation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong for a taxi driver was injured as a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded by a municipal workers . &quot;
the bomb explo@@ ded according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et before re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations were called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was named . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; said army officer Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ days before journalists . &quot;
&quot; we assume , that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible moti@@ fs - probably , it is likely to do the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical for the bombing of mus@@ li@@ stic separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police declared that the attacks could not occur in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with the international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bombs were laid down by the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in the past days , the authorities were informed of secret services on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact date and the places . &quot;
yet un@@ clear what group behind the attacks .
&quot; police gave their officials throughout the country to strengthen safety around the important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and pleasure . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there is always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge against tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to reason @-@ hungry bomb explo@@ sions , Austrian Foreign Affairs recommends that the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to afford the instructions of the Thai Security Council . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( safety level 3 ) applied for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , and Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ar and its en@@ vir@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary trips to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) landed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
&quot; in recent years , this dre@@ amt of the military even in the coming years . &quot;
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs were an attempt to become chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody dis@@ rest , keeps himself up to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting the handle of the insur@@ g@@ able uprising of Muslim rebel for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost one year ago , in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed , most of them foreign tourists were killed . &quot;
it was the bloody assault of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; movement is in the visor of the Federal Constitutional Court .
&quot; after several provinces , the constitutional polic@@ y@@ makers also have made the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; Cont@@ am@@ ity in order against the Freedom of democratic Rules , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional president Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; ident@@ ities movement &quot; is an group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the constitu@@ ents in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - are watching the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely matched to the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; try to catch their target group , where she says , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Council . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts trying to address them with young righteous language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the killing Islam@@ ists as well as just@@ ification .
this is no longer advertising for the own thing .
the propaganda is supposed to agree emotional people .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in any special way .
that is dangerous .
&quot; last , it was given reports of several German states on contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; of Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts are relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the specific party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , alters its target direction and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; thus , if such persons have controlling the party , such people have controlling the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a view to the clear increase of legitim@@ ate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee information , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that it can give right @-@ terrorism structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it may be possible that further true terrorism groups or small groups , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ right moti@@ ves are planning . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or European control of legal terrorism is not recogni@@ zable . &quot;
these groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; Ma@@ ate decided to worry about that many convic@@ tions went on the account of people , who did not appear in the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
&quot; many of the Tat@@ ar@@ ities attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as criminal , politically motivated off@@ ender or tra@@ ilers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences committed before with right @-@ wing extre@@ mes , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example , CDU , SPD or Left , which have been radic@@ alised by right @-@ right voices . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympics or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow to see that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he just disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected .
&quot; in the social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transferred to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his predecessor in the 24 @-@ year @-@ old and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; however , it was rather his not just spor@@ tive figure that attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is still taking part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was a special start of the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in underground countries .
&quot; there were most sport@@ s@@ men in lands , didn &apos;t want to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nickname made the round .
some media signed it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the whale . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun , &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of open @-@ style , there was no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i run for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable , the appearance of the swimming pool from Et@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old celebrated eight months before the Olympia , and had never completed a long distance before the competition . &quot;

&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday to 17.@@ 30 p.m. and forget to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;

tr@@ ump looks not so narrow the threatening election situation .
Republican Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at a election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is no choice for the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then move into the holiday .
&quot; losing Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it would be either folding or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television channel CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich in order for him on the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it was fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; thus he described the US President Barack Obama and the Can@@ di@@ dat@@ in of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , last more resistance emerged . &quot;

Gf@@ K guidance comes after dis@@ appo@@ inting business numbers
the Consumer Research Group Gf@@ K exchanged his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the set@@ backs came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
&quot; the difficult position of the market research project Gf@@ K , the chair that the chair of Chief of Staff Matthias Hart@@ mann will remain un@@ certainty , the longer the longer the promised successes . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Centre Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the resignation of the company management is the worldwide number of five in the industry before a new start .
Gf@@ K @-@ Executive Chef boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year .

&quot; as of September 1 , the management board of Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger took over the management board as a board member of the board of board Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger . &quot;
he is supposed to adopt a &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; function until a successor for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; as a reason for the set@@ backs , the company called &quot; different views &quot; to long @-@ term business affairs . &quot;
there would not be more details on Friday .
&quot; for sure , who will manage the market research company le@@ ite , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; in an@@ le@@ ger@@ ations , it was last Friday , during the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment over the continuing successes of the years ago were introduced . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruit structure of the re@@ struc@@ tions are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business numbers , each one clim@@ bs will be un@@ quiet sometime . &quot;
&quot; if that would be in the case with BMW , this would also be &quot; Qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; it was called . &quot;
&quot; after withdraw@@ als in the preceding quarter of 2016 , the company could not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; relative to the first half of the year , the turnover of € 72@@ 1.2 million is 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; the profit in the second quarter , especially the healthy value of the company , due to its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; in the Consumer Experience , the Group &apos;s consumer experience is necessary to provide a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million under the st@@ line . &quot;

crash@@ es - bus sli@@ pped in cr@@ isp@@ ru@@ des in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
&quot; at an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens , there were killed eight people on Thursday in the Kr@@ um@@ audi@@ n County ( Landkreis Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the passengers suffered serious injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their data , had to devi@@ ate to an oppos@@ e le@@ aster , which is part of the counter@@ road@@ way . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade freed the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emer@@ gen@@ cies came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the last traveler were brought back by a Lin@@ i@@ enb@@ us district to the Kr@@ kon@@ os@@ ner district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel business .
investig@@ ators demanded the load of loading and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic meters will be for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then be further increased , if appropriate improvement is necessary . &quot;
&quot; according to a relevant calculation , the waste price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was found in the approval of the budget , with Kul@@ mb@@ ach that for these se@@ wage plants . &quot;
the Kas@@ endorf Market is required due to further basic principles to make the facilities available .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial factories are made from pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg . &quot;
the cost increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as an administrative director , Herbert Schmidt demonstrated the panel , a new cal@@ ender of the charges for san@@ itation systems was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and sub @-@ discoveries from the previous calendar period will be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; on all three se@@ wage increases , Schmidt established that there are relatively small waste water facilities around the three se@@ wage plant , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to its low distribution basis , for example , expenses for repair of several thousand euros would be engraved . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the se@@ wage plant is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; in all three plants , last three plants remain in a considerable extent due to their age of san@@ itation and repair expend@@ itu@@ res in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world pole , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp is almost 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced by mechanical ventilation system due to a loss of damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping ground , the capacity had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed for almost 20 years , and after almost 20 years of operation the first sep@@ tic pond had to be dischar@@ ged , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge disp@@ osed , and an additional ventil@@ ating option to be installed in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; this extraordinary expenditure came to account for this extraordinary expenditure and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculations period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which is below the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 significantly below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made clear that at low se@@ wage fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; thus , Schmidt is complem@@ ented by the market community of great entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plants over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to continue to stay in a period of stone houses , especially since one could not extend the supply area of the se@@ wer@@ age of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to avoid these systems because it is about de@@ vot@@ al institutions . &quot;
Bulgaria recorded for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in July 1 % on a monthly basis .

the annual average income of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 amounted to -@@ 0.2 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ises
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter An@@ ime is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel towards breeds . &quot;
&quot; with his filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are in@@ bl@@ oss@@ oms , independent tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections per day . &quot;
all errors are to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filter have moved in the past , in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face conveyor or white skin would prop@@ agate the beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; as the last week , some users struck a filter that gave them col@@ oss@@ oms , false teeth and be@@ wit@@ es , called it some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ly . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked whether this repeated contro@@ versy raised to a larger problem , that the company has di@@ vers@@ ed with diversity . &quot;
&quot; the news and the indig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat contacts that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered a ap@@ ologies : the filter was meant for homage to anim@@ e characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but beyond that , the rac@@ ism experienced , remin@@ ded the filter of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others accepted the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose t@@ we@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter was in@@ viol@@ ently and was said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
&quot; she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot;
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ly @-@ lay@@ ered , but that the yellow @-@ blade was pulled into the extre@@ mes . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless density and integr@@ ational amp@@ f , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are different in breed of various older players - could likely be expected to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filtering a picture , it is much more difficult to remain un@@ noticed when such things were un@@ noticed when it was earlier the case , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to extingu@@ ish her Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that the personal contro@@ versy reflects a lack of diversity in the adjust@@ ing practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Z@@ hu crit@@ ici@@ zed for the great part of white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either do they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they may meet such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to tell what to say . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat is mostly un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers to diversity of its workforce and points to its status as private companies .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently set a number of personnel managers and focused on under@@ lined population groups and on internal integration problems . &quot;
&quot; in its part , Z@@ hu said that she will be able to leave their Snap@@ chat account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military kidn@@ apping ISIS intelligence information , re@@ jects Committee of the Congress &quot;
&quot; military institutions of the United States Central Command Chang@@ es changed the following information to mark a optimi@@ stic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq , and in Syria , when the actual conditions of Congress submitted in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ liminary Report , created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Services Committee , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction at Central Command Secret Services , reported how to change their ass@@ essments on American efforts in combat against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news services that were typically taken off by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ es , signed a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site would have been permitted and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers are suffering from our political leaders , &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership error in Cent@@ Com is up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed technical problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct hin@@ ts to change the government peaks below Obama instructions , it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their fore@@ laws , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements before the congress were clearly positive than the facts &quot; presented the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly announced that a military return of the Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Muslim , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is as much clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress retired from Kansas , in a opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 , up to the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the following services to play the danger through ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life , after them , analysts were concerned about manipulation of the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during investigations .
&quot; in addition , additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
Democratic members of the Intelligence Agency published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions .
&quot; in the years of 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com was a over@@ moderate trial for the creation of succ@@ es@@ ent in@@ solven@@ cy ass@@ essments , Isi@@ l and the Iraqi Security Services , gave a member of the House of Represent@@ atives to Adam B. Ship , announced in a opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; does not damage the mor@@ ality among analysts and &quot; gave a little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence to the ri@@ pen@@ se of the White House on Cent@@ Com analysts at the Cent@@ Com Analysis , regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times of investigations were reported by the Pentagon &apos;s General Inspec@@ tor , who were accepted according to the complaints of Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ ju@@ g of the Pentagon , announced in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General Inspec@@ tion would be still underway . &quot;
&quot; however , he also said that &quot; experts sometimes have been involved in regard to the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations have the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of obe@@ dient information about the Islamic State recall disc@@ usses the Islamic State of more than ten years ago , as Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a font in written about just a small occup@@ iers in Iraq and a little time linked to the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team compet@@ ed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government statement that contrary to the statements of the government , received no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refin@@ eries were commissioned to sell oil on the Black@@ market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ s commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was crit@@ ici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ative because of its outstanding positive assessment of war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA winning four @-@ fourth match in the field of women , a show@@ down with great Britain before &quot;
&quot; a day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their goals in mind .
&quot; however , this is what I know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic Contest and are equ@@ alis@@ es in their group with the British in the first place , which are un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet the last lap of the first round in the United States .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will take place in their group from six teams in the first and second place . &quot;
&quot; the first place will run the strong Dutch , somewhat longer from the way , which lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising turbul@@ ence , four years after passing over the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because they did not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 where for her and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team , began to contact the things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , an mental change and a body change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the employer around in London we have now .
we can pl@@ uck the rest completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
&quot; India was going into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed a surprisingly tough and stopped the playing of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it fully led a Sprint with the flat fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and invited the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gateway in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well the next game will depend on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro is constantly feeling and un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , a Ras@@ ender relay between competition and str@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which will protect the bracelets for the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the Turner &apos;s tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you cannot listen to the TV , read a newspaper or talk about your neighbours in the qu@@ eue , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y , or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , would certainly have been sent under these known names , built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even f@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
&quot; on the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognized : aerial pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ plate and may reign long .
&quot; but if I am modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me get attention to the discre@@ et@@ ely charm of the tr@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been an Olympic Event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so annoying that many people I had questioned , didn &apos;t know that it is a Olympi@@ ad port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ anz .
&quot; even though the USA athletes sent for competition , it never won a medal in the trampoline . until 2012 it had a athl@@ ete who managed to finish the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women for women .
&quot; from Canada , Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year . &quot;
&quot; the trampoline bed has a certain exterior , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert but only one of the enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the cardiovascular trem@@ ors of his never to end - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gy@@ ms and divers , which combines two sports that are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means something like &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , bit@@ es and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ ad program according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time &quot; will be evaluated . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio opposite each other . &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and above , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , at the top and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but also in television transmission also another imagin@@ ative destination : the world or the Olympic champion . &quot;
&quot; the targeted route is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I want to see this games as a bit tired .
this trampoline offers an air break .
the V@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ine jum@@ per is up .
a reverse movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ un@@ ed , seem@@ ingly heavier like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes upward , then down to the top . &quot;
&quot; here is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the destination , no wolves enter the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s so Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final customers of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final position as part of a afternoon blo@@ c on both days and 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably will probably over@@ see the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by the Ang@@ us and the objective of male athletes - like the male US Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his new fan base to Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long One of the USA &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia liber@@ ate on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that the protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just trying to break together ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally growing economy with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months , protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and expanded in more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people invaded the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the answer of the government was merciful . &quot;
witnesses gave witness that polic@@ emen shot un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in circulation , videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security staff beat young people with sho@@ cks while they were forced to make a hand @-@ up against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming study .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West .
&quot; American military and secret services closely cooperate with Ethiop@@ ians together to combat terrorist attacks via the region , especially in Somalia . just a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dra@@ stically - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ ie in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , but dis@@ sidents were taken into silence . &quot;
&quot; many have been sent into exile , or in prison , or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian troops . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
&quot; there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the land use until tender in relation to power of the ruling coalition . &quot;
&quot; following a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the ten@@ sions descend along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this trem@@ end@@ ously , controversial line called for hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analysts are afraid that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less forced to use turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of fi@@ bit@@ ration after years of getting off under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via the social media , as cheap smartphones have been more frequently and improved our Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government makes access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , do many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies to hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians suggested that they were so among the protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
&quot; since we were pro@@ sper@@ sed the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ae@@ gean , mainly Christian high countries , in politics and the economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in low@@ lands . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are part of coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests were held in the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , former rebel leader , was a former rebel leader until his death in 2012 was 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he has been viewed as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of corners . &quot;
analysts say that it was particularly engaged in it to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special agent to make opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; following the present regime , Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st , is missing on this basic regime . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that it enjoys not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a ri@@ ot in 2005 , after thousands against elections , that were apparently ten@@ dered by the government &apos;s evidence and stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ ors , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of the un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts pra@@ ises Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ ature , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty . &quot;
but obviously this does not have the intention of internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , protest@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ hic city , conducted by Tig@@ ray , and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray is always more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that protests in the US and other Western allies will bring into an independent position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to break his ally in a vol@@ atile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin free migration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded ISIS was &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ versy that surro@@ unds his campaign by att@@ acking his multi @-@ repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist state of Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication made new questions regarding the communication skills of the Presi@@ dential candidate in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans if he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public .
&quot; it also brings its participation , which make an effort to take it during an event@@ ful stage in protection , to explain the pec@@ uli@@ ar position to declare statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the suggest@@ ion at a election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the claim on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really did not intend to interpre@@ t ISIS and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , at which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to avoid the statement , saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing of it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism lam@@ ented on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tries to draw the focus of his campaign due to falling demand on economic conditions .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t would lead suggestions to higher taxes , and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July , he attracted a strong criticism , when he said , Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s emails , however , explained later , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to rowing .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how specific em@@ bassies of his fans will be taken as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his testim@@ onies enough , so they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even corro@@ sive tone , as its values decreased further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a huge advantage in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; during Mr. Tr@@ ump , in general attempts to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he is accused of understanding his testim@@ onies , or to understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while focusing on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ dispute to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his testimony might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps prominent Princip@@ al , gave himself great effort to defend the candidates in an CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was ISIS an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans are attemp@@ ting to argue that the government served under Obama , where Mrs. Clinton served as an external minist@@ ering to spread it on ISIS acting under control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them before each of his words to ride and vo@@ wed against him . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ells over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Dis@@ counts as only one further evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential candidate .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ atter@@ ed cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front was pushed . &quot;
&quot; So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous there were more than last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
&quot; artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is changing , but I can still not believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but when New York is changing , it is also new inv@@ entions . &quot;
&quot; a Re@@ revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employee and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
&quot; he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end . &quot;
&quot; as a customer offered to provide money for a new outside world , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , did many things . &quot;
Ver@@ b used the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are curtains such as cap@@ ers and saut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are nature pet@@ als .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ ole stream of old tri@@ bal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also being pushed by Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the betra@@ y had closed , she gave a while in a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b , which liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they have ordered that day instead of their usual iced coffee , a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea ordered that another new addition is added . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further slow and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the job , and ordered un@@ wei@@ rd time . &quot;
&quot; I came back to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything cand@@ y with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he had not taken a den@@ ll that the soap store took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has actually used to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee in coffee . &quot;
&quot; I think we will return to their offer , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has prepared to release them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill the cold bre@@ wed coffee in the bottle and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands to an neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was regular customer , and said that he was destroyed by the ground , when the café was closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the location of Lok@@ as and the purch@@ aser felt a new coffee like a return . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a delic@@ acy , President Roosevelt had an Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ mel@@ ile soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans that they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was about the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Z@@ iegel@@ man tells life in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , slo@@ ppy I@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in the shop since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese and ate with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable . &quot;
&quot; as the reporter ordered h@@ ack@@ ers , this was the couple of discussion about food in the era of great depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient , and some cheap , which scatter@@ eth the ingredient . &quot;
imagine so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ oks for male Fel@@ dar@@ es , and it was served freshly baked past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent to hunger during the first World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the way , with which the country went , no longer to be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time in which food for the Americans became a central , ang@@ ed theme , &quot; committed co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
the new budget makes the new budget : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and K@@ asser@@ ollen have been considered as a wonderful way to restore c@@ asser@@ ol@@ ks as a &quot; wonderful way to hide cal@@ ks un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ ek sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry ob@@ servers .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends were tried , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nut@@ riti@@ ous satisfaction was before taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book which also comprises recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a court from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the home@@ opathy .
&quot; as never before or ever since , bud@@ get@@ ary business - among them Louise Stanley , head of Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by pressing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; budget staff &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ e such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals to be justified . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al , &quot; a celebration of historical treats . &quot;
especially pal@@ atable are the reports about the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizen such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen .
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa peas@@ ant cuisine of his kitchen , he sp@@ it like the million heavy man of the world , which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was glorious realistic .
&quot; perhaps President Roosevelt might have committed the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to static an example of his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House produced the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most likely to be prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , went to eat with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man , as well as science in food was applied . &quot;
the couple gave in writing the book the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ mans s@@ ander better understand - for example how food could not throw away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there were the wind de@@ pl@@ eted .
&quot; after the plates were evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they stri@@ pped and Co@@ e had a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ m@@ end@@ ess@@ ert , who ate Roosevelt at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ ver a spo@@ iled , a spoon into the f@@ ences , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E repeated three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ter , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed by bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even with a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civilian group , which according to image newspaper has previously saved nearly 60,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game to attract people from the bom@@ bed houses and to help them in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil society , which shows him in a 11 hour rescue from the tru@@ ffle of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians to bright symbols in the horror of the war .
&quot; however , he has never seen himself as heroes , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die there , live life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack on a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
the helicop@@ ters have thrown four facade bombs above the Alz@@ adi@@ a district . it was filled with chlor@@ o@@ gas .
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from trouble . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that not children are playing , the image records his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ ine is nearly 400 years old
less rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are usually only in the winter to the surface .
this ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swimming with a 1 km / h in the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie get only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; in an average swimming pool of Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic , an average reaches 1,@@ 220 meters in an hour . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
&quot; this kind of lon@@ el@@ iness lifestyle , however , seems to be a sponsor@@ ing for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; anyway from a Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commenting on the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this lif@@ esp@@ an , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist thought long that Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie stone are old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the Ice Sea to the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they would like water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers need to know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
&quot; their time @-@ pent@@ emp@@ ath@@ es were , they , when they had six animals equipped with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , these shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had s@@ lu@@ te the or@@ tho@@ bone of a young polar bears . &quot;
&quot; possibly they ch@@ ase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the iron ore , looking for ca@@ da@@ ver , which are tor@@ mented from higher water layers . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 centi@@ metre . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analy@@ sing with the Carbon @-@ 14 method the lens core of the shar@@ ks . &quot;
this centre of the eye lens is already constructed before the birth of the shar@@ ks which contained in the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in lenti@@ ls .
&quot; her birth was therefore , after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons tests have greater quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in contrast with 220 centi@@ meters long , the lens core contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland shar@@ ks had a normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ metre Greenland was a age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ i with 502 centi@@ metres is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters probably stood at the threshold for the sexually mature and its age was 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the increase obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is likely to be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the old record holder , a 211 years old Green@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to low temperatures , the organism can also live on austerity storms . &quot;
so they ty@@ re later - and al@@ oud slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
the volume increases much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
&quot; the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram elephant . &quot;
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; so , a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on how early as possible as many descendants , &quot; explains the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a very large animal should rather invest in a long life . &quot;
construction site in double pack
&quot; with topics around B@@ auen , the municipal council is concerned in the most recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel received by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently reported residential units can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the plot , plot and closing statements were clari@@ fied and the proposals for survey@@ ing could be placed , the sale of the plots in the housing areas &quot; road road &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Buil@@ der section 1 ) is nothing more in the way . &quot;
&quot; the council is convinced that the blo@@ wers in the rural and quiet residential community Schö@@ nau , young families and ru@@ sty seniors alike . &quot;
&quot; as it was called , construction consent can be cons@@ ul@@ ted immediately at the City Hall , via the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be advised in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure further in@@ quiries to the res@@ ett@@ lement , further commercial companies , associated with the creation of jobs , decided to change the community plan , decided to switch to part in part of this year in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of sub@@ time lar@@ n , there is already proven commercial area around two plots towards State Road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt benef@@ ited most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ins , Head of the Compet@@ ence of Compet@@ ence and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money homes may continue to operate from financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval results in the UK so far . &quot;
they just use great US banks .
&quot; several banks have already announced , to leave jobs . &quot;
&quot; with 10,000 new jobs in the Main Event , Frankfurt am Main Finance , &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the head of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which uni@@ fies the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities as European insurance vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its head office , but this is less important to the financial sector less important than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the emergency base is important to banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , a large fund industry , however , will cut it worse in the infrastructure as well as Dublin . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city with slightly available commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; on the Seine , the Mi@@ xed for top @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of management consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial market for the European inland market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot;
&quot; but London , however , will remain major financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit of the most important financial centre in Europe . &quot;
&quot; according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , in London , about 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking sector in London , according to numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead gives legal costs of the hepatitis C Patent @-@ dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US authorities decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the refund of the legal costs which are created from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was freed from a damages deposit of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts . &quot;
&quot; in case of the case of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US National Secretary in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead has been entitled to the costs incur@@ red during the defence of the F@@ alles . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to con@@ struct Gilead with the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took part in each other def@@ endants and ownership of laboratory work , which So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vi@@ r ab@@ ro@@ un@@ dish , the active ingredient in the medicine of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; from the USA , troops re@@ affir@@ med that they re@@ conquered complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; from the USA , troops have supported the complete control of the northern town Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) proce@@ eded to the extract of the remaining group of fighters that have dug in the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they released over 2,000 civilian persons who were held ho@@ stage as host@@ ages , sharing Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military Council Reuters with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just run up @-@ up operations , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of the federal state . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Hillary Clinton released their tax declar@@ ations for 2015 , and this revealed a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 Clin@@ t donated US $ 1 million for ben@@ evol@@ ent purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton played an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster , for her book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton candidate for vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continued to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign hero@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ ear@@ i announced in a opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false statements and re@@ tra@@ ders in regards to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for U.S. presidential candidate to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by law due to the law . &quot;
&quot; dump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax examination by the tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ t &apos;s electoral campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Co@@ hen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN said that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before the checks are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ us@@ al matters relating to assets , his donations for ben@@ evol@@ ent organizations , his business aries and various other compounds , particularly with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already released a video on the topic on Friday and on Friday a video released on the Internet in which high @-@ tech rep@@ ublic@@ ans will publish his tax returns .
&quot; on Thursday , she said the theme also during a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump paid not or paid only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax ev@@ asion and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that people would make the more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a election campaign for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its seat to exchange Tr@@ ump at a meeting to exchange their tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control test of the IRS , and I am afraid to have &quot; fear &quot; before the elec@@ torate and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign has published tax declar@@ ations by the year 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ ics , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined control rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax returns of the 2015 Clin@@ t revealed that this only was USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike the majority of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main money system was a cost @-@ effective In@@ dex@@ fund , from which the Clin@@ t &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

&quot; natur@@ alist in Tanzania will use an un@@ orthodox way to stop eleph@@ ants , in people inhabited settlements - they throw away con@@ doms , which are filled with chili powder . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ ard Foundation , which had already been the idea for years ago , trained together with the US conservation protection , trained by volunteers in villages in the north of Tanz@@ an@@ anias , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their houses and harvest@@ ing . &quot;
many spe@@ ars have used to defend themselves .
&quot; Friday , world @-@ telephone day is dedicated to animal protection . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit we could observe within this municipalities a change of their attitude , with much more apparent that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without the elephant &quot; , &quot; the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps comprise the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not re@@ iter@@ ated , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown . &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ff mixed with Earth is packed with a fire@@ work ör@@ head into a con@@ dom which is only ad@@ rot@@ ated to the ignition interface .

&quot; however , in the immediate vicinity of the building of a sales ski@@ pping at Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the City Council , the city council refused to be one acc@@ ord . &quot;

&quot; Jewish Director sm@@ ites Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ tied a media watch , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ ference in Berlin since it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; left his troubles in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the front list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel eliminated and eliminated ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via an own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel concept . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel noted that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason that stood behind , loos@@ ened more rage in the director . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , &quot; the worker was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung states . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and seas@@ oned by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; the fact that this is allocated in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a larger dis@@ grace . &quot;
no explanation does not need .
&quot; we expect the &quot; &quot; right conclusion &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
&quot; the incident dissolved a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , when people called the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged Rec@@ or@@ age of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the alleg@@ ations and called &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , &quot; Der Spiegel reported . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct assignment , &quot; Israel does not include in the folder list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it adds the country code to be added now . &quot;

students will join the police on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police sat Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officer tried to resolve the students , which led the police to mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their amb@@ ition about their plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are converted to save money . &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade set between Moscow and Tehran have increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest on pages of Russian companies grew strong on shops in the country , par@@ ted the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , said . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade deal between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 , by 7@@ 0.9 percent , compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade swing was reached by ship@@ ments of machinery , vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily as Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns tourist numbers in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures were broken in Russia from the last year , he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something which hopes of the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gates of mercy
the minist@@ rants from the sea @-@ care unit Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
four stages were carried out together .
&quot; in order to cross the period until the next romantic journey of all minist@@ rants in the presumably two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ rant round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage aims were tested and finally decided to be a special pilgrimage to the B@@ ish@@ o@@ fs@@ stadt Freiburg , where the opening of the Holy Spirit was given a special pilgrimage to this year . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is made of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern , went on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before the parish of Stor@@ ost , pilgrims sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Mu@@ enster Bel@@ ser@@ er loved woman , and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was born from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual tours have been surrounded by a short stimul@@ us in the morning and evening , accompanied by a short stimul@@ us with different prayers , songs and fon@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is of field cross , chap@@ els or churches will always be back to sing together a song from independent pilgrims song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the Et@@ app@@ enz@@ iel@@ en Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty , even more instrumental dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day the Fur@@ tw@@ angen went to G@@ üt@@ enbach on the second day .
&quot; Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : one appeared the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , still had to defeat at the heat of approximately 500 metres of altitude and afterwards . &quot;
the served reward was a joint gr@@ illing at Bad@@ ge in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth mushroom day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went on the closing folder to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; clearly facil@@ it@@ ates and happy met the Min@@ is in the late afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster , and advanced the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a little impulse , God was given here . &quot;
the Min@@ is were greeted by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert in the evening trade show in Münster .
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims could visit the vest@@ ry and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metro@@ pole .
&quot; in the afternoon , we went back to Hor@@ b . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all participants were agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong common experience were min@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; S@@ cot Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ my home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling team &quot;
&quot; Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner &apos;s last night in the Män@@ ner@@ rom in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , as the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took part of the anch@@ ors who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who came home and made the legend being moved home to home a victory of Favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after she took place in March at the train world championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was Jamie Staff substitute .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
&quot; S@@ kin@@ ner was the man when they stayed there , when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now has un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the winner four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and S@@ kin@@ ner put in the qualification round a Olympics , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ ons victorious the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des had gone back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , with the execution of a higher gear , to slow down and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and especially S@@ kin@@ ner to keep the pace . &quot;
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell s@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they rose on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we played one Olympics in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the page of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des gave notice that he was deliberately led to the rail after a weak start . &quot;
he returned to this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion of England .
&quot; for this time , there was no problem with this victory . &quot;
hin@@ der said : &quot; it feels like London on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months as a team .
&quot; we have so badly damaged in so many world titles that it was unbelievable , again at the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which have gained seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a Bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the area of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on 23 March ( an apparently most holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster , were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cage is the same as Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint part , which starts today and will start over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ ds said , &quot; If he won two more gold medals , he should be defeated . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there were further good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest output in the fourth @-@ four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with security . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he was cont@@ ested against the qualification round about the qualification round , to measure him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate women competition , continued tomorrow and ended , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ou@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world war time 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is leaving his strong railroad team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch a sch@@ ar on medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations were driven to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ ums played in the background , so the resignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in the middle of April in the heart of Sex@@ y and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ ots , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when you see the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite later than could the legendary call GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
&quot; future of melt from Portland due to abol@@ ition of the energy contract , &quot;
the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand on the game since the system operator will cancel the energy contract and thereby hur@@ ting all the supply contracts .
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria early this year , no further subsidies for operation of the plant . &quot;
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is running in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland stand on the game . &quot;
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it could come to domin@@ oes that the melting pot is consumed around 10 per cent of the entire electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a closure . &quot;
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which delivered large aluminium mel@@ ts with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ g@@ Valley , divided that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the multilingual possession of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to be operated , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; divided the company . &quot;
AG@@ L continued to continue that the Tre@@ aties were called &quot; safety transactions &quot; that would have been into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong dates for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L told that it had already written the value of contracts at the amount of $ 187 million in the expect@@ ation of a termination .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , to run the &quot; ability of Alco@@ hol ... &quot; to ensure the melt or power supply to the melt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have been able to enter into force from November this year , even if it is still a statement by the contract . &quot;
analysts are war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the sector prior to the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago area near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland , some 600 meg@@ awatts and tom@@ ago consume approximately 900 meg@@ awatts . &quot;
&quot; both systems should disappear from the market , would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a power producer , this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of September issue of the Vog@@ ue issue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ r@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Cl@@ ans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ ing issue of the US Vog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of fol@@ ks , which I love , the view of this co@@ vers to weeping , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z ony@@ ms and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends the cover of her sister and end with a classic twist : they all have planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the kl@@ ash ar@@ rests plot almost every birthday of a children &apos;s call ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You believed that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with hon@@ esty of a character area at 8 am , but Kris had to take part in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue issue , we started a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all great sister Kim likes her what the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue is a league for themselves . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold @-@ selling issue of the year .
&quot; resem@@ bles a circum@@ ference , which rather resem@@ bles a picture tape as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , 8@@ 32 pages of the cover , 6@@ 15 pages ) . &quot;
&quot; the unveil@@ ing of its cover is so se@@ per@@ ished , that in the last two years the journal of the journal is still le@@ ased out of the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low probability that Mrs J@@ enner is described by the magazine as the &quot; perme@@ ate model &quot; of its generation - under the previous category , it is in good society . &quot;
&quot; these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people , or reality stars or young people today , who know how to stop a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is on denomin@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover appeared with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like any success . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always sc@@ anned in the fashion world . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the eye . &quot;
these emotions are high again when the news came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the mis@@ carriage ride seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of September issue of the Vog@@ ue issue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your base of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the journal .
and in their leisure time it is to see in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .

&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the aid of the country are rejected annually from the community centers annually , while the industry reli@@ es on the effects of other short@@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;

&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ dated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , next year , these legal centres are expected to lose an additional 30 percent of its federal government . &quot;
the Director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without a lifting of the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Queensland , community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , leaving people with un@@ mistak@@ able and de@@ pressing debts , families who have been dischar@@ ged by divi@@ den@@ ies - all these people have problems of right way , that they may not receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will be reduced by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of hel@@ pless needs people from Queensland will be forced to agree with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General At@@ tor@@ ney and Federal Minister of the Federal Minister and the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these medium @-@ cuts promp@@ tly , so the people get the help they need to receive legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the State Government comp@@ lied its commitment to raise funding on national average . &quot;
it is now time to view the needs of the community centers and its customers to view the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign indicted for employees to be a weapon .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey conducted before the European elections : SPD and CDU
&quot; during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the gover@@ ning party SPD and CDU will be distinguished . &quot;
this was representative surveys on the opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rain in the north , this is not possible after re@@ frac@@ tion@@ ate in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the government of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CDU that could return to 23 per cent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left should come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight decrease of 6 percent ( previously : 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens are back in the heavy duty of the country . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not present with 3 percent each in the country .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD in Berlin was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; the CDU was only 18 percent , after 2@@ 3,4 percent . &quot;
&quot; this makes it even behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left , with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 14 percent , Af@@ D would be represented in the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP may hope to return to a return , the pir@@ ate would be missed by contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in time : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced disaster .
&quot; the device weighed almost half a kilogram , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 . &quot;
&quot; it was thick and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty strange . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the built @-@ in storage was eight meg@@ abytes , which would have a high resolution for about two sel@@ ections . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro lovers , lovers can buy the devices still in the internet , but they are somehow come from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet era . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturers had announced a few months earlier on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ arian format . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the new mobile phone was able to have a lot of : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to websites was possible by HTML browser , though slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital mailing book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found .
&quot; quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could continue in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market domin@@ ate the market , which came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere , it is today for very many people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold around 1.4 billion devices , based on Samsung and Apple alone , 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
the company &apos;s worldwide sales are around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running stores of countless app providers and telecommunications accounts come . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone is now a whole industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to mass market came in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three instruments in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communication , all with touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; even today , Apple started the most important product of the group for iPhone . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , dominated the market , had the watch . &quot;
&quot; finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
we now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , each German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn the smartphone even time , &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in charge of the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England has to draw the Olympic spirit and Heath@@ row
&quot; Heath@@ row is not only going to live in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country renovation and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the largest attraction of Heath@@ row , as well as in 2012 in London , when we run a large effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; and that will be back , by continuing to create new possibilities for local and companies in the vicinity of Heath@@ row . &quot;
&quot; for our local communities we are already going to create 10,000 new jobs , 40,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such people think that the challenge of the Heath@@ row &apos;s extension is too large . &quot;
&quot; I said that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be bl@@ am@@ ble on the world stage . &quot;
the branches were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ pass , but Heath@@ row answered each question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , Heath@@ row is for many and not a infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on funny growth and leave a legacy of skills and jobs in order to leave the airport as well as in the whole UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , which was built in the middle of the two @-@ frequ@@ ented walking run@@ ways . &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the Heath@@ row extension is also one .
&quot; it is time for us to draw n@@ igh to these Olympic spirit and Heath@@ row , as well as the future business and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of the UK . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ oleum &quot; &quot; regarding display block &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers , advertis@@ ements are expected to get rid of advertising block , a &quot; cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook we announce that there would block display circuits on his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it could update their filters to block their filters in order to block further advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the encoding on its advertis@@ ements to identify it , which is part of the page advertising is to be harder to identify . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the pointing open source community and the envel@@ opes already since the invention of ad block@@ ers in action is &quot; , &quot; and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left social media in the fight , is a powerful indicator for the sector that has become a wor@@ sen@@ ed ad block@@ ers for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people are sco@@ oped worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; at 1.@@ 03 billion a daily active users to access Facebook via their mobile devices , g@@ y@@ advertising makes up 84 percent of the advertising revenue from Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on display recor@@ ders on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of income from that Facebook will be worth the investment as worth menti@@ oning .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that there would be his &quot; ad pre@@ ferences &quot; , &quot; to have more control over them on their targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ min would be new filters , because they also blocked content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users , this does not represent a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a present@@ er of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; sco@@ ops are a bl@@ unt means , why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead , to lay more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
Mrs. qu@@ itting suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police rec@@ alls witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at an presum@@ able suicide bom@@ bed by several vehicles on a motorway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid out in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss population at the age of 49 , which of several vehicles , including a truck car , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified , the police said these as well as every witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation has been opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers are displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoided ?
&quot; this is something which the prosecutor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be made to responsibility .
&quot; in each of the two cases where a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ists do not need to assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year the police was acquitted of the negli@@ gible killing , after having killed a man and killed a man in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and became un@@ conscious in the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court determined that the polic@@ eman -- who had answered on a emergency call -- on a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; perfect exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms to res@@ emble climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have been referred to as similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation imp@@ lies that Venus might have a thin , erotic atmosphere could have been so slow . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet would probably have more dry areas as de earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to lodge life and protected from qu@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus have been exp@@ on@@ ated for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS Scienti@@ sts Anthony Del Gen@@ io , stated in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface , and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like an umbrella to block the surface of a large of the solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result are average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than the earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles evolution that was previously noted by Planet@@ en@@ vision@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; although they were probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years , was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide to a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .

&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and understood that the association will immediately seek after a new Trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years , I have met my duties as Head trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and awareness , &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy wrote in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer of summer long and much thought about how I could improve this team , to give him more depth , it needs to give it a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a complic@@ ity in decisions that affect the power of the team .
this conditions are not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who joined the Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the winner of Jack Adams Awards during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was struck in the first round of Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last years the after@@ season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take up talks again to put on strike
&quot; the working pressure on the withdrawal for northern sea oils are exposed , while all parties are subject to a new conversation on the table , they said the negoti@@ ator . &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group &apos;s Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally carried on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ allies trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of the current battle , says it in a joint statement . &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks that will start next year to re @-@ use the problems .
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has reduced this year to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s coun@@ cils will follow a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company gives the necessary space to get through the market swing .
&quot; Shell has announced his part of thousands of people and plans to spend their oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ companies BG Group r@@ ational . &quot;
&quot; the energy companies are under pressure due to lower raw oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that would depend on the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Scottish @-@ member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest labour disp@@ utes ar@@ ising in the North Sea since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we require a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Kepler measures red @-@ rate of stars in the star@@ ring of the Ple@@ j@@ aden
&quot; the newest mission with the Kepler Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalog of rotation rates , among the stars of the star@@ ring of the Ple@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the ast@@ enh@@ ancements are rotating at different rates , as well as in which connection the rotary @-@ time rooms with the planet . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experience the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ ring , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation , which originated some 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
now you turn on the fastest .
&quot; to top perform@@ ers , these gri@@ pping stars encounter large quantities of star@@ winds . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is empty , its rotation rate starts to slow down . &quot;
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a noticeable star@@ ring -- like s@@ ungl@@ asses -- see .
&quot; the newest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more powerful stars are slower than less massive stars . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes to rotate as smaller . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden , we see that slow rot@@ ors have to be ten@@ dered to be massive , whereas the rot@@ ors &apos; be@@ ak rot@@ ors &apos; said , &apos; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; as the star@@ ring of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the Ple@@ y@@ ades star@@ ring provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s still a lot ahead of us what we like to learn more about how , When and why stars are slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ aden , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star occurs
tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the base bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base Base .
&quot; after his emotional return date , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to join the &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Particip@@ ants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series . &quot;
his sig@@ net under one tenth deal had been compl@@ ained about 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; by the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he will inter@@ act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
players paid Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ es , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 , he managed a number of mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall of Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , there are only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old would not be accepted in the glory hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was , so disputed his appearance outside of the square . &quot;
&quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was issued between 2001 and 2003 , prohibited from ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up to 211 games due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as major susp@@ icious for years having received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done a pleasure for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , Rodri@@ guez said back in time . &quot;
his farewell @-@ day did not run smoothly .
&quot; during many bas@@ eball legends in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include farewell tour . &quot;
my job contains the attempt to win any game . Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who had been married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and the actress Kate Hudson had been told , sympathy with the fans of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ riv@@ eting Boston Red SO@@ X . &quot;

&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the successful athle@@ tics contest this news come to the accident . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected last Sunday , which is used as m@@ asked funds for d@@ op@@ ing@@ substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ court court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to participate in the fo@@ oth@@ s about 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
Ch@@ en has applied for the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; we quoted the CA@@ S together with the International Sport@@ court court CA@@ S . &quot;
&quot; in history , the CA@@ S is not responsible for the first time in history , but the CA@@ S is in charge of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample near Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa caused by the 33 year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; said the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it should deal with the banned substance to act the EP@@ O blood pressure . &quot;
&quot; after B@@ NT , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was suspended provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial should have already been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow promp@@ ted him immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athl@@ ete don &apos;t move the correct sli@@ ps , &quot; he said : &quot; we are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all weigh@@ t@@ li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation can not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ insky &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class to 85 kg , was tested for three days earlier than his brother Tom@@ as@@ z . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , both of which are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association had the complete Russian crew to an exception because of System@@ atic D@@ op@@ ings , also produced in Rio , numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , during the swimming sport , the former expul@@ sion in China had ar@@ isen for heavy disp@@ utes between the athl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t handle the Chinese Olympic champion , Sun Yang . &quot;
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I will be handed over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French Radio . &quot;
sun also stood at the centre of a meditation with Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping be@@ aters , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese Championships in 2014 , but had only been tested for a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ ack@@ ers her rans@@ om
programm@@ ers of Er@@ press@@ ors malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once , some several victims of a attack with press@@ ors software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 per cent of companies had already reached the goal of a Ran@@ som@@ ware creation . &quot;
&quot; 40 per cent of the victims paid to delete the requested of the holes , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their de@@ press@@ ors software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack in company network .
&quot; if they have been successful there , it will be considerably higher than in private use . &quot;
&quot; we are currently ob@@ sc@@ ary fast evolution of the malware , explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertis@@ ements . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators revealed Er@@ press@@ ors Software for itself .
&quot; only in the past few months , private users were the goal , but the change of the company was sho@@ ck@@ led quickly during the past months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , it is searching for non @-@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or Database files as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; afterwards , the software presents the demands of the ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victim need money - usually in form of the cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - transfer . &quot;
&quot; but where with private users the personal photo database is on the game , it is available by companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , damage is falling when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to complete the business activities complete , in one case there were people in danger of danger . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients could be threatened by the loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we do always say to the victims : pay not , you only promote the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ rators in view of a stand@@ still . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers from F @-@ Secure investig@@ ates the user interfaces and contact with the press reports and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually attemp@@ ting to build a sort of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrifices per chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people will be saved according to payments of a few hundred euros , companies must take part hard and get five digits of sum@@ s to return their data . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ites de@@ press@@ ants , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the Antivirus vendor SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is likely that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building blocks to the actual issu@@ er .
&quot; the current malware kits were created by sending malware , advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in the scope of delivery is a custom@@ iz@@ able tool so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the ex@@ pressing are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buying the set of crimin@@ als and commissioned a further to install the software on possible many PCs . &quot;
the payment is performed per in@@ calcul@@ ating calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then apply sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known at many companies that enhance their data .
&quot; over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful path@@ ogen , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the damage to the type of data is still a multiple higher than before . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators , too , could take up completely new goals in the internet of things on the grain . &quot;
&quot; at the h@@ acker conference , def@@ ensive security researchers demonstrated how they were able to control the thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the locking of a species blocked heating such as many victims is quite a rans@@ om . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then block a whole production road instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; rather un@@ load , but the HR @-@ V that has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has been designed , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well processed and well , only the cockpit @-@ top falls somewhat there . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is HR @-@ V in storage space .
&quot; it is not only available for a trunk of 4@@ 53 l in high @-@ resolution and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surface of the back@@ bench can be sto@@ cked up like Kin@@ os@@ ett@@ le and provide storage space which is high from the ground up to the ceiling height of 1.@@ 24 m .
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , however , the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
&quot; however , he is likely to do something more silent . &quot;
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine management : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be more direct .
the equipment can be found in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; no desires open .
&quot; the City &apos;s security systems is part of the City &apos;s Emer@@ gency ( operates at speeds of 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the track support assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision was irrit@@ ated sometimes because , because in the rank@@ ings , many obstacles were assessed as &quot; her@@ an@@ ted objects . &quot; &quot;
&quot; very reliable , the remote assistance is working . &quot;
and the intelligent temp@@ o regul@@ ators react to the transport recognition and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t on demand speed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI @-@ jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit shy .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel are fine .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine will receive 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda provides a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline is not responsible : fall on the aircraft bridge
an air@@ line is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger aircraft .
&quot; for a liability may only be imagin@@ able with dangers , which are typical for the air traffic , argu@@ ed the District Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a knee should be broken .
&quot; the accident could happen , however , could happen everywhere - it &apos;s a general risk of life like the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease incident : when paid the promot@@ er
&quot; after their journey , you only get money back after their journey , if the cause of the disease is desper@@ ate @-@ free in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; this is , however , only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , a family was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting in the second day . &quot;
she almost spent the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the holi@@ day@@ makers back to a defective cl@@ ap that allegedly poll@@ utes the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organizers .
&quot; before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the cl@@ auses in fact was defective . &quot;
but the organizer was just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to go out until then that the sea water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of water no contam@@ inations were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps due to infectious each other - belong to the overall risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was said to have committed violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must s@@ uns and respond to terror at the same time .
safe is : our country will not answer the perpet@@ rators of perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .
we won &apos;t fail this triumph .
&quot; if off@@ ender would have to leave the country faster , but increases safety and strength even the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to achieve proposals by proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced a further development of security forces , although &quot; in medium four @-@ digit order form over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be re@@ acted under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire may be so amended that above all the purchase of weapons in the Internet is exhausted . &quot;
the last much discussed hum@@ ili@@ aries for physicians shall be settled according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to search for solutions , as the haz@@ ards of the citizens could be reduced , he said with a look at the mental enjoyment . &quot;
&quot; in order to oppos@@ e the radic@@ alization of refugees , the ministers holds a better social service . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared to deal with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning investig@@ ating investig@@ ators .
SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety further .
it is important that the Interior Minister said clearly against shareholder .
&quot; this was a ear@@ whi@@ st@@ le for the Shar@@ ing in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the papers of the media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double nationality earlier .
a generic ban of full supp@@ lication he is constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic for constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
&quot; you can not offer everything you re@@ jects , and I rest the tro@@ phy of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
we could speak about rules about traffic or witness against judgment .

better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
there are regularly on the envel@@ op road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this should change : the jurisdiction shall be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all car , drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every night when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; road operation will length@@ ens on the upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer street and the departure of Wes@@ eler Strasse , the road turns off right by 700 meters . &quot;
car driver can then take right from the Hammer road to the right .
&quot; the great advantage , the traffic shares itself early , making the total turn@@ out of the highway 51 is improved . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of the German representation of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the Zu@@ br@@ inger gets the motor@@ ists mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also in addition . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the needle on the B 51 is just before the departure of Wes@@ eler Road . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic will only be over@@ loaded on the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be returned to a three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; due to the reason : static calculations revealed that the bridge has no longer the necessary load @-@ bearing capacity , in order to absorb the heavy duty on the heavy traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long as these bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected St@@ au will continue , the state will not be able to say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to expect : for the bridge has an official residual period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the state operation is sought out in the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
traffic will be hired on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
Inter@@ cultural Travel : Culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the theater &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club Nim@@ a &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s Association allows young people to visit with mig@@ rat@@ ory and refugee inter@@ background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The Un@@ seen Haus &quot; of the Young The@@ aters in Münster .
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; organisation of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; was attended by 19 students between eleven and 15 years of age in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Association , which has set up the cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee inter@@ background to the target , to visit schools with welcome classes in the context of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible to follow the course of the course , so the press release of the Young Theater in Münster . &quot;
&quot; the club Nim@@ a &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theater are working together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without flu@@ x and migration background are expected to receive professional courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal play and the@@ atri@@ cal language placement are in planning .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; project continues .
&quot; given the increased refugee figures , the association reck@@ ons with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope in weather conditions
&quot; the weather has made the shooting stars in south @-@ west Germany during the night to Friday , a stroke through the bill - but there is hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was badly damaged because of clouds and rain , the chair@@ woman of the ob@@ servatory , said Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the stars are Per@@ ei@@ des , which belong to the fastest stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; their names have they , because they apparently come out of the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , that goes in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you get around for ever , at night you &apos;ll wake up hours , morning is already far from the wake @-@ up to think out of sleep . &quot;
that is all other than relaxing .
&quot; after all , you have such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten per cent will find their sleep frequently or permanently re@@ relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes that are based on them , st@@ resses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society of Sle@@ ep and D@@ enti@@ stry . &quot;
&quot; but what you understands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nie , i.e. one entry and a sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; many people just feel uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the member of the German House Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psychological or contra@@ ctual factors behind it , can also be stuck . &quot;
it is not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is often common with depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
and it may be that various factors thank each other .
&quot; for example , if a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , they wake up every two to three hours and starts to cra@@ wling over all day problems and worry , there &apos;s a sample . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I sleep with sleep problems ?
&quot; who should not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week , should go to the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is ab@@ ro@@ uted , tired , unable to sleep , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood s@@ wings or physical symptoms such as mag@@ ician or heada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; to relie@@ ve sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ oral changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy , or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only occurs in the exceptional case and at most for two weeks - in@@ quiries . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , in Germany , he hardly emphas@@ ized that Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ bers , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical centre at the Char@@ ité University of Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why you should initially turn to sleep problems first at home , advis@@ es we@@ aving . &quot;
it can clarify with examinations if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should take a sleep laboratory , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in the sleep laboratory medicine medical studies , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing , for example , if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ j@@ le explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please make no lunch break , &quot; says Fi@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; after sealing , one goes into the bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; beside the electro@@ des on the body you carry a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ at on your finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera shows a ceiling on the ceiling . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get problems into the handle ?
&quot; there are rather many positions , on which one can sit for a better sleep . &quot;
&quot; We@@ e@@ ß is on : regular sleep and rising times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watch TV to sleep , alcohol throw and at night not at the clock - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not enough . &quot;
what the Jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself by Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he brought the first gold world championships for the first time in Doha , and set his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V Ath@@ let Mark D@@ ei@@ bler has made a protective team @-@ mate for his cr@@ iti@@ que in the cr@@ iti@@ que @-@ team @-@ team . &quot;
&quot; in a country where a € 20,000 is a premium winner and a Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ kö@@ nig 150,000 € should not be surprised to wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night . &quot;
&quot; the convey@@ ing system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping controls , however very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we can not compete with countries that are very much promoting and even on the subject of d@@ oping , or even run it up . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; he explained further . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , he would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how one should keep it with countries .

airport : Bande was arrested by Bag@@ di@@ eben
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the Airport Düsseldorf
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed to capture the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ ar@@ ities had committed to several T@@ ash@@ ore and Bag@@ di@@ spar@@ es as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civil servants recognized a gang of Bande in the area of Düsseldorf , which was known from the police officers of former theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed during the mid @-@ July of this year , and were gener@@ alized , working and particularly professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime ab@@ ov@@ ate 34 can report the th@@ ie@@ ves , who had traveled to Germany , to investigate four actions . &quot;
&quot; in total , they acquired more than 15.000 euros . &quot;
&quot; alt@@ itudes , a few lin@@ den baths , in between , still a remainder of head@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works on the first sight not so , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; you walk along the road from the east to the west , one comes along places , a beautiful nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; to the facade of a grey house , someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished , is already built : by 2017 , there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy estate , &quot; such as the real estate firm Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , are preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of ten@@ ancy , on the ground floor , are still occupied spaces and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator had been responsible for a hard advance of the police against the project , the area as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers and three weeks before the place , locked parts of the road and held visitors on the street to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers in order of unknown house owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the evacu@@ ation was illegal , and a day later police and builders moved under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peace@@ fully : parents walking with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement park in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain@@ ed late late . &quot;
&quot; in immediate proximity of the skin projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located . &quot;
&quot; left Viol@@ ence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who are living here three children , are gener@@ alized primarily by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they share the concern of increasing awareness and vent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t sound after a Kie@@ z who wanted to pose a majority of police protection against v@@ agu@@ ing left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police have set up between home@@ owners and their neighbours , apparently not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in Berlin was actually a traditional working area , which is also a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; there are also many houses in the former GDR too . in 1990 , numerous houses have been occupied by the former GDR , including almost the entire mainstre@@ am street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the mainstre@@ am had been cleared under a regular police station in a regular street , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in the last years has become increasingly important to the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : with them a native of East @-@ times and former home network had become their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this has also been noticeable in the Mi@@ xed , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on the designed discs or freshly painted facade that were thrown with dy@@ es .
no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for this , that not all the neighbours therefore could see it as a problem , it could not necessarily be affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the crimes committed to criminal off@@ ences , the ten@@ dencies rather to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house next to the disputed 94 years , cannot be given by un@@ certainty . &quot;
&quot; according to violence , they are appe@@ ti@@ fied : the people in 94 are their neighbours who have not been ordained . &quot;
even the famous com@@ end cars admit it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; when studying architect , her street is not a crime point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately moved to the Rig@@ a@@ er road - and stayed .
&quot; therefore , it was so important that the residents back their street : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the town in July . &quot;
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the streets will continue to be taken away : by sigh@@ ted new@@ buildings in the former building blocks that im@@ min@@ ate the old inhabitants .
&quot; that &apos;s finally con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people living here , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I have absolutely not gu@@ ig@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do , if any one stop anyone ? &quot;
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , also by police and inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for coinci@@ ding containing over colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who draws up , should be aware of it - just like anyone who attracts in a pub @-@ quarters , can be po@@ or@@ ly compl@@ ained about noise . &quot;
&quot; all people with first names presented , are asked to be asked not to be called with their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugees
&quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organizer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Agency for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else can be joined . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the honorary volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , who has a problem of wool mil@@ dew that has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less mo@@ cked than rather on the multitude of inv@@ enting responsibilities - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; we were looking for an administrative building with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long experience in the field of social work , just a jeal@@ ous Woll@@ um@@ au . &quot;
&quot; yet administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes . &quot;
&quot; especially the organization , work with men on site and also behind the scenes , as well as nets . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for six weeks .
she has a 50 @-@ percent job to three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ en- and main actors supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers are soon available in the Was@@ enstraße
&quot; it has been a heavy problem for some time , to find apartments for the connection of the connection , which have been recognized . &quot;
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
they have to accommodate refugees in their own or rented rooms .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodation must be carried out . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the land@@ rat@@ chet to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time than very difficult .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it has not been working to do so yet Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , non @-@ general apartments must be appe@@ aled as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are positioned in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le are one . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ Euro jobs and pay@@ outs for refugees and migrants , to be established or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ master , do not work for work - and that motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community is to a positive outside effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not mean work .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Client . &quot;
people would have to develop a rig@@ orous feeling .
&quot; so it offers offers like sports , contacts with loc@@ als and in particular language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so also jump here administration and hon@@ esty .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long time of procedure is a problem .
&quot; you need to explain the refugees that it will take away and it can make time sensible , for example , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who sometimes feel the feeling of developing , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , who would not work and be un@@ profitable , that will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority are motivated .
&quot; but the customer also says , &quot; &quot; says the honest , &quot; &quot; people where nothing goes . &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer may always motiv@@ ate others to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this was a &quot; mamm@@ oth problem . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says very clearly , &quot; &quot; what more man@@ cher may call &quot; &quot; a remainder of the risk and don &apos;t want to exclu@@ de it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensitive .
these incid@@ ents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the terrorist attacks them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so you have to look at the main - and hon@@ esty in the region and in the region of activities .
&quot; they always have always in the background , that soon a new act of migrants and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a limit ?
the policy is clear to answer this question .
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived there where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would relax the situation .
&quot; Reg@@ ine Client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher is well used , so that the previous people can be sensible . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; however , when people are in need to help them , both women be lon@@ ely . &quot;
the political situation is so complicated there is no easy answers .
