<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. presidential candidates are however at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can damage - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to climb the economy to death and regulate to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by contrast, he himself would be quite different, claims droump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will return Regulations, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching control reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in contrast, Clinton says: the state has to fulfill specific tasks, he has to open the disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the wealthy would be increased, says she."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in that season, Trump and Clinton say almost wortful."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, the internal discussions could be added."</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and return the coal extraction in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also possible to announce the Paris Climate Agreement to the Paris Climate Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"by contrast, Clinton wants to strengthen renewable energy with their investment program:" a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"there will be either China, Germany or America, and I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transposfish trading agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the United States would not want to protect themselves from international trade - rather than American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid even better for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars was a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what do you want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, The minimum wage needs to be, then he says he would not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to boost its economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him before, so the budget deficit would only be bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who wants to demand more of the rich, that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost daily life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"every one has a baby, which is a year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks into the room with great eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother rigid on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid programmes in Bavaria, and deals with the topic women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are volatile.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no one - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a wax before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated: every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because of them torture or death, because they send them their families as a hopeful to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for the escape:" many are secretly steal, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced labor, religious mornings, slavery, or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugboat calls for a bottle of water a sexual act is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that when they arrived in Germany, Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, women in refugee accommodations would often be regarded as inferior, and in worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 per cent of women, living in the area of Munich, are traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so pleasant to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the awakening, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't dare to help, it only need more accommodations for them, urges Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District governments for the accommodation of refugees are in charge."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question, whether they wit from a similar project as in Munich in their authority field, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is not something about the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Schwaben alone, women were not divided up separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press preteners of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central franken, there are floors of floors or own homes for only single-standing women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study which was published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy or men are absent, men and women can come together to - ongoing - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the shower room should be separated and accessible to women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as much the women felt this protection of this protection, one can read at the Andhrase which there is in Munich's house."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since himself has been around, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistant doctors have called their union to approve new labour measures in their dispute relating to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has demanded its entire council from the beginning of September more labour measures.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that there had been a minister to concern about the concerns relating to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract which has been agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who have voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt, said that the government had remained very quiet."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," In view of this, the JDC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and demands the official new negotiations to all Ears. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board has set a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to begin a running programme of escalating labour, which starts at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the alleged involvement in the NHS's first total waste in the history of NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">"according to the election of the agreed contract conditions, Dr. Johann Malawana came back to the vote of the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during meetings which took place before the vote by 54.000 assistant doctors and medical students, with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of foreign side"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish turn in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the purge, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile was narrowed, and he scarcely made heat, even for its restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said to his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report complete five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even better improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have heard that it would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">"with me, his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling, showed that the Russian President of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the crisis of the crisis was the first that he mentioned in his execution: the agreement of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wutted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the treason was even bigger, as it was committed by a dearest friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">The opening again will be difficult when not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the nationally controlled media led a heavy, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed to bear the Turks for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the serious test, the allegations of leading officers, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apologies of the Erdogan President, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire lie clearly on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends who he can get after the last month in a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have met Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count towards a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the State Wedding Advice on fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this way: "tourists there for long, tomatoes here."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is raged in the West, as the reaction to the tried power was considered weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition to this, persistent Groll come across the EU's accession negotiations and Putin - the pid to withdraw from the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, Russian President, in Ankara, won a bonus for ensuring that, after the attempted coup d" état, he demanded the support for the elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-evident for Moscow, notices a self-intelligibility to change regime itself."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this glittering palace of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, as it once described me an analyst," alliance of foreign side ": two countries that stumbled from the West and feel bad and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support other side."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it might be noted, that after almost three hours, both President responded to the press conference that they didn't even hear the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey promised it to answer to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open fendencies - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, NATO member Turkey shifted the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green Party: investors should become much stronger in the future.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD proposes to the next councils "concept of housing."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first line is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD Group President Christoph Frmann said:" "we are happy with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas in the future, must show 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be established in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the major dispute in the town hall is, however, violmann:" how are you about investors who want to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to build investors on such surfaces at least 10 per cent, but possible 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new townhouse construction programme, which will cost millions, is to be paid for incentives."</seg>

<seg id="15">The Left Party wants to be toughness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of what, violmann, bathe the situation of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the concept concept is implemented, and will provide additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program is not entirely entirely: for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built-in."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how is the loss of further 1300 cheap apartments, whose advances will run in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments alone by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, as planned spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased in current bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to get back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">On a hit you can solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the western city, they are running at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be returned to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners to residential property companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, one removes the target of the so-called flow."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social weak in just a few districts is to give it no more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens is estimated that there will be a movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travel joint ventured his immune system and throws a serious test - by removing some of the most dirty and eccentest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel autor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk withdrew its course on a euro notes, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a washing head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before filling each object, he used a Luminometer, to show and show us what he will let."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, titled" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "was filmed, brought some surprising results in daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought that flashing up a draw toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely shockproof, but in fact, in a kitchen donate more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists on promoting intestinal bacteria and its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing left behind him, which he refused, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by moving through the world, and ate peculiar and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railways to railway stations up to the washing of toilets, the task set up his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child, I was relatively unworried about what my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sledge water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was justified in his call."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proofing showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison, the Luminometer number is freshly washed hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse, after its Luminometres of more than 4000 units, while fresh washed hands are less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterial number of places in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not touch here because it is inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's fascinating about watching and at the same time the benefits of Probiotics explains.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstorings that ended with that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense for humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film's direction, added:" let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him, like the eclipse of Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to put them up and others, with which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we have some of these dirty treats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by the survey conducted in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents performed in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent reported that they also contain at least occasionally products that included lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="27">But it is not possible to imagine that the terrorist attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people in view of the high refugee numbers are concerned about security."</seg>

<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a Horses through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older flat buyers maintain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of Yougov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would follow a news report on TV, I would follow me the camera, while I am in the midst of a bustling street in Soho run, I keep my hands and defining something like:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart is sown slowly at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now, the buildings in which once independent seller have been based - is there a handful of fantastic turntables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman probably to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in immediate proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate your age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I received from Sister Ray (data of data: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such sizable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy plates that he had appeared and again to buy items that he sold, when he was young and plexed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought to buy something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it's true that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets the Yougov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about comeback and to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations, which I have led, people usually have ended up in 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records back again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to Appendices of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record shops offers a relaxing community of equalises."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and would like to keep moving out to stability of familiar sound hard drives, objects of objects, happy youth groups."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as a collector and I think it's so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" soldered a staff from a flat stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month, did not hear it yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a turntables that they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at that time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I blossessed a stack to Bossa Nova Komigations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data of data: three men mean age) has realized a" trophy effect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone got up recently here and said," I have no turntables, but I would like to buy a radio record, so I'd like to put them into the shelf. "" he says. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musiklist."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">"there are younger people, not elderly, which are only slow."</seg>
<seg id="44">"fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blowly audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make pictures, Teenage and Women's middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest Synthesizer- and Examorous Pop instead of experimental jazz drills from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but brand-psychological traumata are hard to be fixed, if you stand for another 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs for some minutes in the shop and consider the variety of plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She looks more a mannebullock than a big buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, therefore, collecting records are not real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or another way but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a dearest plague.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the suggestion to mug the jeans hotspot, I observe a group of young girls who grouped for a moment by polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Crosley table players."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of nobles by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks at it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and to send some customers into the depths of Soos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it's no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research research shows that the results of Yougov vote, they let at least in record shops in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforen."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security out of plates of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while she flatter the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, who rises above the shoulders of the middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French Court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees are living."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the government should have to settle for 72 provisortive businesses, where people offer temporary stores or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisorical restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Calais Prefecture argued that these places would be torn down, because they would represent a parallel economy, which would not be paid out of tax and fire risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals that were supported by the nationally supported association and other groups, do not offer enough food for growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in addition, they led out that the provisional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who would operate the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as merely people live to live in extremely prevalent conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas are quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the rainbow was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des camp, which is non-profit-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as an advice to asylum seekers for the hundreds of protection needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to maintain the kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, Spirit, Health: singing doing Senior Citizens"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the Singen has accompanied her entire life: as a young girl she was in the choir as a young girl, she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a sample, they feel balanced, joyful and overall, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"very next, they do something good in their health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because Singen is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German Cancer League."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by regular merging, senior social contacts can connect and maintain."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often, social and familial structures of the age are frequently solved, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also been part of Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to arrange and organize and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cleins."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can sing in the positive sense, Hackler writes."</seg>
<seg id="12">A deep and controlled respiration will exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"those who calls his lung regularly, as well as in everyday life, not so fast from the purest."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it comes to get the sound of voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, Singen often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz says from the German Labour community of seniors-organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and leisure time."</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people are many memories often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">"through Liedtexte and particularly melodies, people decomposes itself to long past events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, a special performance is required, Lenz explains."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrate on the own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially elderly people, who live alone, do not only practice themselves on itself."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one finds through the singing in the choir, Hackler writes."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I do long for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, do not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, says Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you do not sing alone - with 50 singing people, who ever hears a sound next?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"searching for the appropriate offer, Senior Citizens offers various possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"someone sings out of the acquaintorial circle in a senior chain, you can easily connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">"who wants to sing in a church choir, can turn right to the church or church leaders."</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior professionals can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the internet, your family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="35">"whoever lust has to sing, should necessarily connect to a choir, advises hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late it is, there are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro is constantly feeling and unavoidable, a Rasender relay between competition and struts."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which will protect the bracelets for the swimmers to the Turner's triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot listen to the TV, read a newspaper or talk about your neighbours in the queue, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, would certainly have been sent under these known names, built by sponsors and well-being-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even freal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized: aerial pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastplate and may reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I am modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me get attention to the discreetely charm of the trolines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been an Olympic Event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so annoying that many people I had questioned, didn't know that it is a Olympiad portart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignoranz.</seg>
<seg id="15">"even though the USA athletes sent for competition, it never won a medal in the trampoline. until 2012 it had a athlete who managed to finish the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who share the women for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">"from Canada, Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline bed has a certain exterior, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear for a clownsschool as the sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert but only one of the enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cardiovascular tremors of his never to end - but also the Grazie of the gyms and divers, which combines two sports that are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means something like" jumping board. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"the winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, bites and saltos) before they land at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympiad program according to execution, difficulty level and" flight time "will be evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio opposite each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and above, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, at the top and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but also in television transmission also another imaginative destination: the world or the Olympic champion."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted route is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir up a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I want to see this games as a bit tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers an air break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the trampoline jumper is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A reverse movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she pruned, seemingly heavier like an astronaut, goes upward, then down to the top."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the destination, no wolves enter the distance, only the dreaming, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia liberate on violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just trying to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally growing economy with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded in more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people invaded the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the answer of the government was merciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave witness that policemen shot unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security staff beat young people with shocks while they were forced to make a hand-up against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming study.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will even become more difficult," "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services closely cooperate with Ethiopians together to combat terrorist attacks via the region, especially in Somalia. just a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new Pendlerie in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, but dissidents were taken into silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many have been sent into exile, or in prison, or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian troops."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">"there are numerous complaints, which cover everything from the land use until tender in relation to power of the ruling coalition."</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions descend along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this tremendously, controversial line called for hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts are afraid that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced to use turbulence and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of fibitration after years of getting off under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate via the social media, as cheap smartphones have been more frequently and improved our Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government makes access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, do many people still can communicate via internet proxies to hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians suggested that they were so among the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since we were prospersed the Amharas, who mainly come from Aegean, mainly Christian high countries, in politics and the economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in lowlands."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are part of coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, former rebel leader, was a former rebel leader until his death in 2012 was 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he has been viewed as tactical genius, a man who could think of corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was particularly engaged in it to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special agent to make opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"following the present regime, Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst, is missing on this basic regime."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that it enjoys not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a riot in 2005, after thousands against elections, that were apparently tendered by the government's evidence and stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Razors, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of the unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praises Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendlerature, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not have the intention of internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesting in Gondar, an amharhic city, conducted by Tigray, and hatred toward the Tigray is always more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests in the US and other Western allies will bring into an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to break his ally in a volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin free migration."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he attracted a strong criticism, when he said, Mrs. Clint's emails, however, explained later," Of course, I said the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then return to rowing.</seg>

<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"coes last book" Chop Suey "was about the Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman tells life in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, sloppy Imbiss at the Flatiron District, which has been in the shop since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brickman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and ate with olive oil, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato purée and vegetable."</seg>
<seg id="12">"as the reporter ordered hackers, this was the couple of discussion about food in the era of great depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food were very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they were prepared from an ingredient, and some cheap, which scattereth the ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE smiled.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach as lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooks for male Feldares, and it was served freshly baked pastete for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent to hunger during the first World War." a Square Meal "shows the way, with which the country went, no longer to be the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in which food for the Americans became a central, anged theme," committed coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget makes the new budget: mysterious foods such as breads and Kasserollen have been considered as a wonderful way to restore casserolks as a "wonderful way to hide calks unappetizing ingredients under a creek sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry observers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of the American kitchen for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar blends were tried, because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction was before taste or even healthy kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book which also comprises recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to the midday," says Coe. "</seg>

<seg id="35">Especially palatable are the reports about the government's response to the hungry citizen such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-Cake-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was glorious realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">"perhaps President Roosevelt might have committed the same error, if not his wife Eleanor would have asked him to static an example of his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, a housekeeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House produced the boring food in Washington, but also one of the most likely to be prepared."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of Great Depression, went to eat with food, was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs."</seg>

<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal" Science "anyway from a Greenland, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commenting on the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the evolutionary biologist thought long that Greenlandhaie stone are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the Ice Sea to the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they would like water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers need to know about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>

<seg id="19">"possibly they chase them sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the iron ore, looking for cadaver, which are tormented from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimetre."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analysing with the Carbon-14 method the lens core of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already constructed before the birth of the sharks which contained in the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in lentils.</seg>
<seg id="25">"her birth was therefore, after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests have greater quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in contrast with 220 centimeters long, the lens core contained a low excess of carbon-14 out of nuclear weapons, so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland sharks had a normal carbon-14 amounts, which caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-metre Greenland was a age of 335 years, while the record-shari with 502 centimetres is likely to be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for the sexually mature and its age was 156 years, Grönlandhaie with the increase obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the old record holder, a 211 years old Greenlandwal, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures, the organism can also live on austerity storms."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they tyre later - and aloud slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume increases much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">"the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram elephant."</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"so, a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on how early as possible as many descendants," explains the evolutionary biologist. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>

<seg id="8">"the planet would probably have more dry areas as de earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to lodge life and protected from quaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of Erpressors malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, some several victims of a attack with pressors software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 per cent of companies had already reached the goal of a Ransomware creation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"40 per cent of the victims paid to delete the requested of the holes, in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their depressors software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack in company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they have been successful there, it will be considerably higher than in private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently obscary fast evolution of the malware, explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" World. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most malwareprograms were still designed to send advertisements."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators revealed Erpressors Software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only in the past few months, private users were the goal, but the change of the company was shockled quickly during the past months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer's computer, it is searching for non-long changed files such as Word-, Excel- or Database files as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"afterwards, the software presents the demands of the extortion."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victim need money - usually in form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin - transfer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where with private users the personal photo database is on the game, it is available by companies for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, damage is falling when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent had to complete the business activities complete, in one case there were people in danger of danger."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients could be threatened by the loss of hospitals."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we do always say to the victims: pay not, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators in view of a standstill."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers from F-Secure investigates the user interfaces and contact with the press reports and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually attempting to build a sort of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifices per chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct support sites, or decrypt free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people will be saved according to payments of a few hundred euros, companies must take part hard and get five digits of sums to return their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ransomites depressants, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus vendor SOPHOS:" a single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is likely that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building blocks to the actual issuer.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the current malware kits were created by sending malware, advice and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in the scope of delivery is a customizable tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The expressing are then looking for further hackers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set of criminals and commissioned a further to install the software on possible many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is performed per incalculating calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then apply spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known at many companies that enhance their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">"over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust in the Malwarebytes survey to defend Ransomware using file-back-ups and scannersoftware."</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful pathogen, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing, explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="41">"with this, the damage to the type of data is still a multiple higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the perpetrators, too, could take up completely new goals in the internet of things on the grain."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the hacker conference, defensive security researchers demonstrated how they were able to control the thermostat under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the locking of a species blocked heating such as many victims is quite a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block a whole production road instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you get around for ever, at night you'll wake up hours, morning is already far from the wake-up to think out of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, you have such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten per cent will find their sleep frequently or permanently rerelaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many causes that are based on them, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society of Sleep and Dentistry."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but what you understands, however, is the Insomnie, i.e. one entry and a sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"many people just feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the member of the German House Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychological or contractual factors behind it, can also be stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often common with depression," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, if a herniated disc can be bad, they wake up every two to three hours and starts to crawling over all day problems and worry, there's a sample."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who should not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week, should go to the doctor, advises Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is abrouted, tired, unable to sleep, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical symptoms such as magician or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options, among other things, behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioral therapy, or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only occurs in the exceptional case and at most for two weeks - inquiries."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, in Germany, he hardly emphasized that Prof. Ingo Fibers, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre at the Charité University of Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"that is why you should initially turn to sleep problems first at home, advises weaving."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with examinations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should take a sleep laboratory, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the sleep laboratory medicine medical studies, for example, in snoring with breathing, for example, if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fijle explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please make no lunch break," says Fibers. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after sealing, one goes into the bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"beside the electrodes on the body you carry a nose goggles, a chest strap and a feat on your finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera shows a ceiling on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get problems into the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">"there are rather many positions, on which one can sit for a better sleep."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weeß is on: regular sleep and rising times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watch TV to sleep, alcohol throw and at night not at the clock - then you start to count immediately, and that's quite and not enough."</seg>

<seg id="6">"reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents of tenancy, on the ground floor, are still occupied spaces and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Innensenator had been responsible for a hard advance of the police against the project, the area as" no-go-zone "for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers and three weeks before the place, locked parts of the road and held visitors on the street to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers in order of unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the evacuation was illegal, and a day later police and builders moved under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walking with children, people sit on the pavement park in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained late late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in immediate proximity of the skin projects, a primary school and kindergartens are located."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left Violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez, and Jana *, who are living here three children, are generalized primarily by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the skin projects, they share the concern of increasing awareness and ventrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound after a Kiez who wanted to pose a majority of police protection against vaguing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin Innensenator and the police have set up between homeowners and their neighbours, apparently not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in Berlin was actually a traditional working area, which is also a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="18">"there are also many houses in the former GDR too. in 1990, numerous houses have been occupied by the former GDR, including almost the entire mainstream street near the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the mainstream had been cleared under a regular police station in a regular street, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in the last years has become increasingly important to the magnets for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them a native of East-times and former home network had become their Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this has also been noticeable in the Mixed, which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on the designed discs or freshly painted facade that were thrown with dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned so often together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for this, that not all the neighbours therefore could see it as a problem, it could not necessarily be affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, statistics almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the largest part of the crimes committed to criminal offences, the tendencies rather to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house next to the disputed 94 years, cannot be given by uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"according to violence, they are appetified: the people in 94 are their neighbours who have not been ordained."</seg>

<seg id="29">"when studying architect, her street is not a crime point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately moved to the Rigaer road - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"therefore, it was so important that the residents back their street: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the town in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer the streets will continue to be taken away: by sighted newbuildings in the former building blocks that imminate the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that's finally condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here are more people living here," she says. "</seg>
