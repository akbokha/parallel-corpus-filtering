Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not loyal .
the two wanted to address the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ating measures in the Middle East .
it also alleged that the conflict with the Palestinians and the addressed two @-@ states @-@ solution also discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been eag@@ erly anticip@@ ating the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu .
Washington is critic@@ ised the in@@ contin@@ ual settlement of Israel and raises the lack of ad@@ ren@@ dering the peace process .
&quot; through the deal , the deal was wor@@ sen@@ ed by Obama &apos;s Iran nuclear programme . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu held an invitation to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress which was used to count as an aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting agreed with regard to the elected election in Israel at that time . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor tries to have shot his friend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon talked with a little z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers came to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably more excited , and he said , the family contact of dead women could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was on a white block , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved to love me . this was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who had traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , was already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed after the police in his office . &quot;
Delta State University &apos;s chief designer Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ itäts @-@ Stu@@ ff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 am .
&quot; he said that Lamb has made the omin@@ ous emergency call sometime , sometime . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life , when the police landed him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities always try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; details of the details of the state have published details , such as students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police at G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; as Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he distributed his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both included in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which included 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavior .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the Lamb Manager , said he seemed too excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously requested the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he only addressed two online courses . &quot;
&quot; due to the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy , the doctorate , which lamb had worked so hard for the Lamb , had no guarantee for an automatic way to establish as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; Univers@@ itäts @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he kno@@ cks nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus the police came later to Lam@@ bs track when he came to the Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as again .
&quot; before he could be arrested , the self @-@ contained a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ yl Johnson . &quot;
his car was going to go in .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why the lamb had come to this house , but Johnson said it believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has more than 3,@@ 500 students in a town of approximately 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he earned a doctorate in spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friendship Lam@@ bs called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla Hair@@ ston said , she was 15 and he was 20 when they met together through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; they and their friends were in High School , and he was the cool guy guy , who tried some years to bring her the guitar game . &quot;
he was the warm of women at that time .
&quot; all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were quite some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house who ad@@ ad@@ here to one Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot;
the police said that the dog was al@@ right .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
they and her mother were absolute best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met lamb , but because his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared three years ago in a summer fair .
later they played together to one or another G@@ ig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes fun coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night at night completed the last time after lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ious aspect . &quot;
there were no signs of that something was not right .
&quot; just said just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we went on the streets and were j@@ est@@ ing together .
I mean they had a good sense for joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the tot@@ e professor , headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , &quot; Don &apos;t Mitchell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and became President of his Brotherhood and the Stud@@ ents Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday night , around 900 people attended the Delta State University in Cleveland , including teachers , employees , students and members of the church at a candle @-@ like memorial service . &quot;
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the watch watch while the University &apos;s &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans , contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police had now said after he had shot him , and that he had shot him as his wife , but there is no indication that the two had ever married . &quot;

Michael J. Fox att@@ aches about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was notable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were at the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realise that the seat is right beside me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I &apos;m a sim@@ ulated guest and an arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date . &quot;

UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban Ki @-@ moon , Secretary @-@ General , says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; for almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN security Council , to unite and promote inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban announced a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five member member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the general meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he un@@ fortunate that the att@@ itudes within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation permanently det@@ ach@@ able . &quot;
&quot; ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria in order to show the same solidarity and unity , which they demonstrated in Iran &apos;s strike deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Re@@ frac@@ tion@@ ate values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously too seriously .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how many rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper stran@@ ds at p@@ olls , it still has not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys were conducted by Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for chances of nomin@@ ation of real estate business . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump may probably win the republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
&quot; experts have emphas@@ ized that , at that time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys guided tour to the asc@@ ending Herman Cain , and none of them had won only one state in the nomin@@ ation process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but external groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ es Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start to drop their dollars to overthrow it .
&quot; here are some current outline values , which suggest that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary stage : &quot;
Tr@@ uman &apos;s popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump ow@@ es his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of the ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
&quot; at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent . &quot;
&quot; now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion , Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
some three out of ten say that they have negative opinion .
these figures pay in early countries .
&quot; a fifth ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa has found last week , that 60 per cent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion . &quot;
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P elec@@ tors GO@@ P were happy with ump than candidates .
&quot; in a CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would &quot; be off@@ ended , &quot; when he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; just Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they were &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same over tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied , &quot; or &quot; off@@ ended &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favourite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would . &quot;
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the new Republican voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is seen in the first pres@@ sur@@ ge state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the Republican women think that he had the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively implement his office , and for nearly six out of 10 independent experts predic@@ t that its temper@@ ament is not the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / Post . &quot;
republi@@ can voters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
&quot; when they keep up their money ten@@ te , Republican @-@ voters t@@ ump is real for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation , say to a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four out of ten in the end of July you set off their money to Je@@ b Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P elec@@ tors had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans , Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation as opposed to 28 % against the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P elec@@ tors &quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign will be plau@@ sible &quot; campaign . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump reaches almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts refer to that the breaking field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ dump support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; prior to Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of border Paul , John Kaz@@ i and Chris Christie 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
&quot; the only candidate , who kills him ? &quot;
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , the dump support , say they have gained their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course it can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never to change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 per cent said they open the door open , to change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other outer se@@ iter , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as frequently for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans affir@@ m that they are allowed to agree with tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump commented &quot; &quot; rape crisis &quot; &quot; in his election campaign against two months ago , the immigration reform and the annual leave of the public dis@@ course was launched in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic im@@ print of Tr@@ ump @-@ Americans is captured by the Republican Party and damage re @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; however , according to the new ABC / post pol@@ l , six of the 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will say , that they match the question of immigration in immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump appears to have to do . &quot;
fru@@ stration on the government climbed to new high@@ s .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son there is now around half the support of republi@@ can voters , mainly through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day @-@ pol@@ l of ABC / Post they would prefer to have a policy out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines registry / Bloomberg in Iowa , primarily two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , at 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods of Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg path is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea coast .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a roof @-@ house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer to objects is naturally limited , so it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which special areas will cost 1 square meters most . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student union in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , one of the price comes out like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate provider Angel@@ s &amp; Nations has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square prices in a dizz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several more ten@@ ths of Euro , nothing - per square meter , noticeable . &quot;
but good who can afford you ...
&quot; Incid@@ entally , Munich is not at the top here . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a race .
&quot; a happy hit by Thomas Müller , based on FC Bayern , paved the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ raeus - then ran it . &quot;
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze took a dream start in the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the wit@@ ch chair by Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their enthusiasm in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to garbage he@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Göt@@ zes matches ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth strong start in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; Müller was awarded the Champions League for the Bavarian Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ aid in the Champions League on May 28 , who succeeded to pass on one as a fl@@ ank shot fired by the World Cup in the Champions League . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate these things , Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame had promised at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 @-@ h@@ ott@@ ish fans - and the Munich knew his word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shiny .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus gained his most recent six home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , including against prominent clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled here . &quot;
&quot; the Bavaria , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up bag@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; they went so cour@@ ageous , but in their most intensive efforts , however , they often go into inv@@ inci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often directed at Lin@@ ks@@ berg Douglas Costa , which was seldom heard against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck left when his fl@@ ank was hit from the right corner of To@@ re@@ ck .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion belonged to the potential 2 : 0 . &quot;
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski &apos;s best occasions in half one had the best occasions .
&quot; first , as the Olympic champion Bor@@ mer Brown pushed the head on pole of Poland ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then , by direct delivery , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; even though the Bayern dominated her usual game , Pir@@ ate could set sail &apos;s con@@ i@@ fer . &quot;
but Manuel New was a copy of the company .
so when he turned a shot of ideas about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; newly appointed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a fourth @-@ dip with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , based on muscular problems at Ka@@ der , sitting outside initially . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given the green light after the final training as the World Board , Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought the King@@ sley Com@@ an for his de@@ jected Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
&quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) , and 13 minutes later everything was clear , by El@@ f@@ meters , Müller has one better . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it was at Kra@@ v@@ alle Stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of district conducting Bayern fans in their audience block had apparently prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pir@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , captured the security forces , and went with b@@ anners against the Munich tra@@ ilers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured in the stadium .
&quot; smoking , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; the one who roug@@ h@@ ages , does not only harm the lungs , but also to teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : at accident the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smoking permitted a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several contribut@@ ors to the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to qu@@ itting smoking , smokers was able to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely while the 2.5 @-@ 2.5 to 3.6 @-@ f@@ ache was higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth dec@@ ay be c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ ival tissue and st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ izes the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to frequent g@@ ing@@ iv@@ itis in smoke .
&quot; should not be clari@@ fied , however , smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; however , people who stopped smoking at smoking could reduce their risk in the &quot; journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it could last for ten years until the threat comes to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , the firstborn Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man should convince people of being non @-@ smoking , the director of H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; smoking short@@ ens life time . &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge as well as to a good health health up to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by denti@@ sts , the DI@@ f@@ E dealt with . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study covers the findings .
archae@@ ologists will cast off the remains of the late ancient town
&quot; once again , archaeological finds were held at the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard archae@@ ologists have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains historical buildings , said Museum der Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine are histori@@ ans on the search of so @-@ called ground monuments .
&quot; at all ship@@ ments in the Cologne city district , the museum has always been moved to the Department of Archae@@ ological Ground jungle . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine lev@@ lev@@ ards , the archae@@ ologists have now compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; text records have already been known that there was a fortress and in the 8th century a church that had suffered a church , explained about Trier . &quot;
&quot; besides rem@@ nants of the fortress and church tower , a cemetery with about 350 graves have been discovered , probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes in dispute over the TT@@ IP renewed court
&quot; for de@@ formation of the dispute over the Trans@@ atl@@ antic Trade Agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission proposed a major reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the cont@@ enti@@ ous private services for disp@@ utes between the concert and states are therefore to be solved by a transparent system , which corresponds to much more traditional dishes in its functioning . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens &quot; , &quot; said S @-@ Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström when drawing you . &quot;
the Swedish has submitted a proposal to the European negoti@@ ating position in the US trade negotiations with the United States .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TT@@ IP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone should develop 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; plans for the Reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration procedures are con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely informed that the EU states and the USA chose independent judges , jointly by a new capital court . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , United States , and third @-@ party nations . &quot;

&quot; besides him , a fli@@ p@@ chart , to which the in@@ timi@@ dated artist , recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly seized by Stev@@ ens lecture . &quot;
he tells about different places he always records back on the map to talk about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ as and tender songs .

&quot; since that time , Stev@@ ens has been er@@ adic@@ ated as a magnificent experience . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 released and third album &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; he composed smart songs that harmon@@ ise very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time the great opul@@ ent sun . &quot;

&quot; Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister , &quot;
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns made a excitement at the prime minister of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , will also mark his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo and for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will ex@@ alt you to adjust the first of his six prescribed questions shortly after noon , whereby his power is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from the area . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary inspection for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ let &apos;s appointment and after his speech on the TU@@ C @-@ Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the hearing of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked a criticism of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and stands in the focus of multiple title pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , has drawn attention to himself &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood &quot; in respec@@ t@@ ful st@@ illness &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ ium of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ir@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he ended the Labour leader to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; independent &quot; from his faith that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of sha@@ dows of sha@@ des have refused to serve as a leader in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party was elected as leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says , political differences are also within Labour &quot; and , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union , and the limitation of prizes . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the TU@@ C Conference told that Labour changes to re @-@ remove the whole idea of a limitation . &quot;
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the sha@@ dows of labor and retirement , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ 23.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour MEP to be president David Cameron , ever since he has T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Disp@@ atch Card in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour MEP who has promised a different policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions of Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the prime minister is to be con@@ front@@ ative and that he has made both &quot; impact &quot; and the stretch with contradic@@ tions , and has to focus on serious problems as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Sha@@ dows of Economic Affairs , is represented if he does not participate , for example if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea in conversation , that other colleagues gently seize the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the room in order to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he is tied in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le The@@ aters &quot; who often admitted to the prime minister of the Prime Minister . however , some years later he admitted he was in keeping in it . &quot;
&quot; when it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was recognized by Prime Minister and its leadership of the executive building and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus , while critics argu@@ ed that they have argu@@ ed on a caric@@ ature and require far reaching reforms . &quot;

the pound climbed by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump on the rival supply of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .

&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional work@@ places . &quot;

met@@ cash starts ground @-@ dis@@ miss@@ al campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
&quot; Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of the Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ dis@@ miss@@ al campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia to defend a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di is opening the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets to build their relationships with local food suppliers and marketing the brand IG@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via social media on the same as events such as Adelaide . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealer and suppliers jump on board , with stamps such as ice r@@ ut@@ ters from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A shops and shop owner who sell the remaining tickets for the South Australian Football League to faithful customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that cash cash further details of its defense strategy published on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler being through for food , alcohol and devices through their annual investors strategy date . &quot;
&quot; there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A cargo shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; South Australia and Western Australia are listed and IG@@ A retailers are a more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland , with more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia as compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts as Morgan Stanley said Al@@ di has become twelve months after opening his first markets to take away some five percent of the food market in these two states and take all existing ac@@ adem@@ ics , but primarily independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley suggested that IG@@ A retail@@ er should lose $ 360 million in sales up to $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens up 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating annual revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; due to the loss in food and food stores and with the amounts of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed rate , met@@ cash may cost roughly $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , metal recorded market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A ste@@ ad@@ ders are the most widely known . &quot;
Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenue in food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent market share will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , talked to a business meeting in Melbourne that he probably will disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to react to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash received with Mr Dou@@ glass last week contact with Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food retail@@ er , which has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflected the operating debt reduction in equal pressure on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler being tra@@ ce@@ able , however , investing more than 150 million dollars to compens@@ ate selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ s@@ ths in hundreds of products every week to improve fresh foods and provide better choice of private label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading renovation programs are embar@@ r@@ assed , hoping that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth in four years for the first time in four years . &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is is supported by Steve He@@ aly from the Australian tennis court .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is deser@@ ved more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm round his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and earned a rather praise for his own behavior towards the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; co@@ ca@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is still referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; , &quot; became the not@@ orious feeling of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fierce qualifying match in Cincinnati soon afterwards , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , but Harrison draws : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA had to beat Cy@@ an@@ vil , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen as he crushed a tennis ra@@ cket , a cr@@ amp had crushed a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ ca@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
te@@ ens is currently at Glasgow in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth on second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ semi@@ finals .
&quot; one thing I &apos;m proud of , is the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi was a bit worried about the dispute . &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost to the US Open because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to know a ra@@ cket of fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of them . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around itself , and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he goes into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players he is trained in the changing area , he is a very stable and advanced young guy , and I think he ear@@ ns it , according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , that &apos;s not take into consideration the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right to all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term integral part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; C@@ yr@@ na &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick has managed a very fast rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he asc@@ ends to the eyes of the public , but we try to keep it understand@@ able , but we try to keep it reason@@ ably priced , and it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , close the border , with@@ holds refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency , and moved the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and stopped all that tried to stop illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serb civil servants with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; the people who had fled from violence were met for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents , and settled in there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations climbed up .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the immigrants &quot; opening the border ! &quot; and they cried out to the police on the Hungarian police . &quot;
some refused to protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia declared foreign minister , &quot; it is &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back to Greece while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days of conversations with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
&quot; during an ongoing meeting in Brussels , the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian Serbian border have followed one day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ block at a controversial meeting in Brussels . &quot;
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Greece and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would have reached some 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria required a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hung@@ arians won &apos;t set his hopes for a balanced promotion of Brussels or his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency force in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to shift the crisis , so they could ex@@ ert roads leaving asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ re@@ to said that his country is also building the building of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania plan to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after having finished a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners have been used in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become major areas of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees to have protection - a view that is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , hit the crossing of the limit or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also declare a higher prison terms for the traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency duty , &quot; said government speakers Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the application of the military even to the military which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen an armed conflict with vehicles and dogs . &quot;

&quot; they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of criminal off@@ ences according to the new law . &quot;
authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials concluded two of the seven border trans@@ itions with Serbia , after a train agon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos caused the major border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ zing a crowd in order to push himself there . &quot;
&quot; some 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
a further group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would spend food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders to the national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race to nomin@@ ate national level but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over to the ground .
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the preliminary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is on second position , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed the presidential office for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the voters &apos;s democratic elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic elec@@ tors say that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidate will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant to their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while doing some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton keeps a great advantage in women and mix@@ tures , but these resolutions have reduced . &quot;
&quot; her support for men is significantly lower , and S@@ anders can only go back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton &apos;s benefit in democratic elec@@ tors in 50 years has failed , and they and S@@ anders are at the same height now . &quot;
but Clinton still has a great advantage in older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit margin with the liber@@ als but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead at this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic elec@@ torate of the elections are nationwide , that they would be backed by the party &apos;s enthusiasm when she was nominated by the party . &quot;
&quot; one quarter would support them with some reserved , and further 15 percent would only support them because it is the can@@ did@@ ature . &quot;
they wouldn &apos;t support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters is thr@@ illed with it .
the views are stronger in those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
&quot; whereas 48 percent of democratic elec@@ tors say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , a less Republican voters call this across its top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when scientists want to be asked in an open question , why they want the candidates that it &apos;s the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s support is also menti@@ onn@@ ed its connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to deal with the problems and the load capacity is also cited .
&quot; since the vice president considers the potential for the presidential office in the orph@@ ans , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic elec@@ torate in the pre@@ election are asked , who for the party would be the second choice , Bi@@ den is at the fore@@ front . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ ton followers more than half , that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far off . &quot;
&quot; if bi@@ den decides to kan@@ di@@ st not to can@@ di@@ ate the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton raises by 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race for 30 points without him . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton to win as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 per cent per month . &quot;
&quot; by far the bias is a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as &quot; &quot; most of &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , not one single democr@@ at@@ as candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate is un@@ acceptable in un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates teach good results with some important features for voters of their party &apos;s elections .
&quot; benefits instruc@@ ts Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as tru@@ thful and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong guide qualities . &quot;
bees for the three candidates most deci@@ ding at hon@@ esty while the leader is the leader in Clin@@ t &apos;s strength .
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have any opinion about him . &quot;
&quot; in general , Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their beliefs in general is Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since we have questions to Hillary Clinton &apos;s personal e @-@ mail address and a server while office ministers continue to be established , most of the Democratic elec@@ torate of the elections are happy with their statement of the matter and say that their opinions has not been affected . &quot;
but there is a total of other history in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy has no effect on their common opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still had wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views in Clinton become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded as hon@@ estly and tru@@ st@@ worthy by the elec@@ tors of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of voting rights are not eligible for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights have to be seen as non @-@ honest and un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump has , however , get good notes with lead . &quot;
&quot; of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush joined the best at hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority focus rather than hon@@ estly , but as at Car@@ son there have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic elec@@ tors in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son ref@@ uses behind Mc@@ Donald Tr@@ ump in nation
Ben Car@@ son is home to the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; in the meantime , half of the support of voters decided in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republican voters will continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the latest support is 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
&quot; the survey also indicated that , in demo@@ graphic groups , Car@@ son has exceeded all Republican @-@ elec@@ tors under republi@@ can elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Governor John Kas@@ im , is sm@@ itten down with Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who has fallen by 10 % support for the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida @-@ governor of Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are on the third place . &quot;
&quot; the error margin of 3@@ 76 persons from the Republican elec@@ tors in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % , and was carried out in September . &quot;
&quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , released last week , shows that Car@@ son lives in the p@@ olls - he ends with 19 % support in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support . &quot;
&quot; the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed pl@@ ump greatly before Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; at a glance at the last week , Car@@ son found some side@@ walks for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son gave himself guilty to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said on last Saturday during a live performance in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant beach temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; when top values are measured in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find hot water . &quot;
&quot; a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a pleasure , at a maximum of 17 degrees . &quot;
&quot; no longer goes to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares this week . &quot;
&quot; forest temperatures continue to keep the Mediterranean sea : in the east , it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic sea , there are 25 degrees in the world , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood and the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ com@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student passed during a student @-@ like rit@@ ual as a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pa . , M@@ ord@@ an@@ compl@@ ain shall be filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood called Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a boarding conclusion as in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with associated eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and had been attacked , while trying to go on a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about headache , and then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood called not the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g s@@ wo@@ oned and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital like the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes to contact his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ gn@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members began to hide the tools and set the br@@ otherhood of the Brotherhood over those of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gn@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the very next morning . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ olog@@ ation report , Den@@ g has been repeated with bl@@ az@@ ing force injuries on the head , hull and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; for many families , the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood were destroyed . at least one student dies off the Sch@@ ic@@ ans since 1970 , and Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , represents the lawyer &apos;s family , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
&quot; a County Grand Jury named Monroe , set up an indictment for the first five members for the first five members . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for aggressive attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make the responsible persons responsible , but if there is an organization that has officially or officially - this is sanc@@ tion@@ ed , so we will also draw them to this account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national br@@ otherhood is calling its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; a rate of interest comes , and the Haus@@ se will be advised to increase yields of bonds , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
&quot; what we don &apos;t know how long this will take , and how long it will last . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy is only small guidance for the course of exp@@ ir@@ ation . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor here , like economy and financial investments . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the US central bank are so strongly emphas@@ ized that investors should not focus on how it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; by the end , market participants may note that all the excitement is exagger@@ ated because of interest @-@ rate hike . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is being interpreted by some of a signal to the end of the era of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we expect not the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on too low level to lead to the seis@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a view on historical trends based looking at how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the advantages of interest rates for some anni@@ versaries can be vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase is reached , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that patri@@ mon@@ ed yield ends 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German Bank analysts in a recent study to what had been reported in the F@@ ed by interest . &quot;
&quot; more precisely in the past 35 years , the market usually has an upward trend - roughly 14 percent - on its way to interest @-@ rate hike , and then back to the normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in recent six days from 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return reported in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares will usually occur later in the enh@@ ancing cycle and the return is starting to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic watch@@ men , but interest rates also promote them often . &quot;
&quot; in current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ts with some conditions that could not accelerate and accelerate the recession . &quot;
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in interest in the F@@ ed interest rate .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate has been boo@@ sted twice the nominal GDP at 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although it was 3.6 percent for the second quarter of 2015 , only few expect that this will do and expect just 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; interest in such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop might be ris@@ ky and asked the question as if it is different , &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have set up all year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures @-@ trade show only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all boo@@ sting cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um in GDP , and on off @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ous mar@@ riages had taken place very quickly after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , this is a very slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market mer@@ its a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; with bonds , the R@@ end@@ ites seem to change direction , as soon as the first raise / drop is carried out in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Incre@@ asing cycle , the bond yields to immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to fold the gap between long and shorter bonds , and lead to a bend of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ ine in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest is , Jones said that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of the inflation expectations there are some evidence that the market has adjusted to more str@@ ingent monetary policy .
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit ten@@ sion@@ ing have expanded and the vol@@ atility has increased - all market characteristics when the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , businesses will benefit from entering the larger part of their business activities in the USA , benef@@ iting from interest rates and be more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debts will be worse , as a rising value their products on the global market more expensive and as well as financing their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after an initial interest rate hike , &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs analysts predic@@ ts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; a strong balance sheet companies had a strong balance sheet with a strong balance sheet after each of interest income in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 for an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital ratios as well as low vol@@ atility in their shares have also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality around 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
&quot; with a high proportion of flexible interest in the majority , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers also will benefit through the increasing dollar . &quot;
&quot; spar@@ es could see gains from higher income , even if experts in different opinion is how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament committee Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Con@@ serv@@ atives of Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for its &quot; stup@@ idity . &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly not differenti@@ ated from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also targeted at BBC Music Awards and said they only did The Br@@ its
EP @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice of The Voice on and said that this was not very originally .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading party member and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do anything that does not do the private . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ serv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , &quot; &quot; condemned the public radio station &quot; &quot; and increasingly not to differ from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; digest@@ ed &quot; but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he was also aimed at BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seems to be with The Br@@ its just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you are actually only im@@ printed what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
&quot; the BBC General Director proved the alleg@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 moves far in front of his commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and enlighten@@ ment . &quot;
what I want from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is sur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to inv@@ ent new music and to create new works , also really are important for me , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that harder it should be working to engage in the audience , as it did in the past , because the British had less information about classical music . &quot;
&quot; but radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production which took place during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , under fire for the commercial rival to the feet . &quot;
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins attacked The Voice on - the musical talent show at the BBC which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
see why this program is often discussed is because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; on special BBC @-@ style &quot; was produced .
&quot; he added that he would like to find the company &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; if it was the next time a entertainment body . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further rows from The Voice in the future , or to spend money in entertainment formats for other entertainment formats . &quot;
&quot; Internet sales rose in August , slow@@ est down and Black Friday can be responsible for it . &quot;
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in the year 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday did down the editions in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping was bo@@ oming , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into ghost cities . &quot;
&quot; but experts say that there are now indications that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the overall rise in August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in the year 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that stag@@ n@@ ating online sales after new numbers showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; when you look at the growth rates for previous years and going back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales complex in The Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales were up three years ago , when buyers began to operate with their cell phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , this one comm@@ utes itself , and we may see that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the following sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold its purchases in this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers have crossed off websites . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that black Friday , with whom the buyers were carrying out for bar@@ gain , will have to stop purchases . &quot;
a British Retail Con@@ sortium study found out that £ 5 spending money was issued more than £ 1 online .
some products such as TV and washing machines are now carried out more than one third of the purchases via web shops .
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of human clothes and shoes are purchases online instead of fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims are buried in Mec@@ ca for the crane accident in Mec@@ ca - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
&quot; the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried out by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial sites in Mec@@ ca , by the streets . &quot;
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse of this huge Saudi bin Laden &apos;s huge Saudi bin Laden .
the Ministry of Health said that in total 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims were assembled than 29 of the victims were buried in the streets to bury those who were killed , when a crane collapsed in the Mec@@ ca mosque . &quot;
&quot; filled , largely in white dressed , the way to z@@ ap their respect , when the first of the dead sat on their final journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m @-@ cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession was passing by the Holy Sites , where only days earlier a building crane collapsed by the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed pl@@ ung@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi King appointed over the construction company of the bin Laden , because of the disaster that resulted in a san@@ ction 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
&quot; the dead bodies of 29 be@@ ers , killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central mosque in Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; amongst the dead we found Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collapsed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great mosque .
&quot; Saudi officials have already promised that the ho@@ w@@ aving to Mec@@ ca with thousands of thousands , who continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden Group had not been able to stand on the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arabic version of the decree , published by the Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the business abroad must be prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the fall of the sick , which crashed into a courtyard of the grand@@ mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place this month . &quot;
the bin Laden Group has issued no statements on the collapse of the crane and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ham@@ pered the group because of not current safety measures and because it is not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mos@@ sy as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over large construction projects .
&quot; the late @-@ leader Al Qaeda leader , Osama bin Laden , was a son of a son who was disp@@ oss@@ essed from the family in the 1990 @-@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the middle of a strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is least once in the life of any healthy person . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
governmental representatives invited to pay 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries .
other injuries will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss says the time of cheap Eastern European art@@ is@@ ans is over
British employ more and more craftsmen ; says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe raised rise beyond
&quot; for this purpose , 200 additional screen @-@ bug@@ gers that are aimed at art@@ is@@ ans will be opened , &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
&quot; Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that British will work off her h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified East European art@@ is@@ ans , which carry out work in their home &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to treat walls , you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ its increasingly employ the art@@ is@@ ans to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the Baum@@ gart@@ ner chain , said that a great increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , the services too low prices have been over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; thus , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ right Shops to arrange tra@@ des@@ people and close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ri said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop will be taken by women . &quot;
at the moment the men domin@@ ate the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to make the growing demo@@ graphic trends , that have more female single @-@ homes that have more renovation than in the past . &quot;
Mrs. Lau@@ ri said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger to balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients consists of women with 80 percent of their decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in decision process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also included her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company , which has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ri said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is here an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her hid a reduction in the half year income and par@@ agra@@ phs since the group ap@@ ologi@@ zed for closing of the stores .
&quot; because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
functions of a@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Regional Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials from Austria &apos;s volleyball Vice @-@ Vice @-@ runner a@@ I / DO@@ B have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and play@@ houses .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse of abuse .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was post@@ pon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused was cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the years 2006 to 2011 that the accused were able to sponsor organisations used in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he expects the damage to the damage with around 400,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged on finance .
&quot; this fact divided the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ler , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , Germany . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the cast of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence tells us that the club was not a wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials had only been b@@ illing damage and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and invested a lot of time and money from debt through the debt - the liabilities were approximately 600,000 sh@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : do we continue to drive the club ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in a bread gra@@ dient of the financial centre . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have donated money , put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; he said in the participation . &quot;
&quot; be agreed with the club : you can manage the money , no debt must be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the dis@@ bur@@ sement of the allowance for the withdrawal of the allowance is concluded by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore you have paid a part of the initial damages not only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was paid on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , flat and non @-@ detailed bookings , the former Ob@@ mann , seemed to perform the processes . &quot;
&quot; the bank accounts and Sav@@ ings administered both def@@ endants in common , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the exclusion will not be put in detail in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the club was not interested in detail in the financial aid , important to freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 against the a function@@ ary investigation against the abuse of abuse , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the club statement . &quot;
the def@@ endants had been suggested declared the def@@ endants .
this securities current went on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known as the association &apos;s testimony .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
this didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
&quot; finally , he thought he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened to him , no one would have known something about this money , the prosecutor dropped into the room . &quot;
&quot; the accused was informed , and the function@@ ary was true . &quot;
this assignment was form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
&quot; why do you need damage , judge or prosec@@ uting attor@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the first def@@ endant , he would not agree with this formulation , because the association never existed for damage . &quot;
&quot; what should I do when the lawyer says , &apos; You are all from the tail@@ or &apos; . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he said the Fun@@ ction@@ ality , he never reck@@ ons a cent content , and he only reck@@ ons o@@ dom@@ ed and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he added € 1,000 per month to di@@ ets that took charge of the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documentation for the early years could not show the def@@ endants .
&quot; these are after an operating test , where everything has been judged correctly , no longer have been kept , they declared . &quot;
kilometre deposits also included the second accused .
&quot; all equ@@ ations are made in cash , with whom he have to travel from his place of international international market to the bank to Abi@@ burg , he stated in his testimony . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard sets another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the workforce of three years , the free@@ think@@ esis will remain in developing further jobs in the development of the company . &quot;
the positions at the US @-@ based shoulder strap He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not find an end .
&quot; in the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut down from 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its company &apos;s customers . &quot;
&quot; this means that the company could be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion , which will come down from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs for the past three years is not yet completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP had approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
listed in stock were 2.3 per cent of the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Share .
&quot; the group , based in California , Palo Alto , are currently divided into : thus , the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company - separate from the reporting areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are expected to be recorded on the stock exchange .
a more dis@@ appo@@ inting PC @-@ section as well as a weaker demand for company customers after its services set the second largest PC manufacturer to phone the world .
&quot; in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 per cent by the end of July . &quot;
turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this means that the revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters were back .
HP respon@@ ds to a spin @-@ off and massive positions on change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only made it late to buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and always do more shops whatsoever . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ mans restructuring plans have a total of approximately 5@@ 5,000 positions in total . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , the majority shar@@ ehol@@ ding of German soldiers on host@@ ilities in Iraq , however , were mainly attributable to re@@ jection : 54 percent said against it , 35 percent failed . &quot;
&quot; for example , that other states fly air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are able to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a cooperation with the Syrian mach@@ in@@ ers of Bashar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of the respondents , would be 20 percent . &quot;
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
&quot; at the core of the fair until September 27 , connected cars , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th international automobile exhibition entitled &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the wide audience can attend the Frankfurt Motor Show .
&quot; the organizer of the V@@ DA @-@ Verband der V@@ DA , like two years ago , are about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : Serb @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; the Hungarian police on the Serbian border , at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ shed against several hundred re@@ jects refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ one@@ al Cor@@ respon@@ dent Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the violence at the border control point .
he reported telephone :
a group of refugees crossing the border .
behind it had a polic@@ eman sc@@ anned and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water c@@ un@@ cher .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started to throw plastic , bum@@ ps and plastic bottles . &quot;
the officials initially dis@@ continued un@@ inter@@ rupt@@ ly pep@@ per@@ mint .
then the police launched Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tr@@ ump has been spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now rest@@ rained a bit now .
a pregnant and apparently bare woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had met the lac@@ ri@@ fug@@ al , cried out . &quot;
other refugees came together in themselves and l@@ ayed in short@@ ening .
also the press @-@ ro@@ oft@@ ops of the Serb police have suffered from injuries through the use of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Pep@@ per@@ mint .
&quot; time of decision on interest rates for the US state , &quot;
&quot; the world ob@@ serves if the U.S. not@@ ebook in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest will be raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who had been questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain in a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it &apos;s seven years ago since the F@@ ed wins at NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach towards a situation in which a major Central Bank is leaving the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Leit@@ ner associate at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate just a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to increase up an increase , but the signs indicate that chances are against such a step . &quot;
the final decision will be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday .
mort@@ al of the Delta State University post@@ pon@@ ed debt relief
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleague , Sh@@ annon was a note to say that he would &quot; feel &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and , &quot; he could make it un@@ common , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police at G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , Teacher for Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences at the Delta State University , said the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said , He shot at someone and killed one . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the staff of the emergency call said that the police had to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; I made my wife last night &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; and the police asked the call to his name , but he was not given him . &quot;
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police came to the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note of Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could do it . &quot;
Amy loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , 300 miles lead to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing E@@ than Schmidt , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police officers came . &quot;
&quot; Univers@@ itäts @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he kno@@ cks nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb didn &apos;t believe that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday , there was no evidence &quot; no evidence &quot; of a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was written by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married to about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced fifteen years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss , a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; by the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss have their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss work online from home , after the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , which was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss at the Sun Her@@ ald . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , having a dog named Light@@ ning , had met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , lamb I have called at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he was not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen came home on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , lamb got his car to the side , and fled to walking , ran into the woods and killing himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; lamb received a PhD in spring 2015 from the University of Delta State University , as his li@@ vest@@ ment from the University website . &quot;

all this calls for sure its tribute .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can not play for months of double expression
&quot; in the Champions League defeat in Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fac@@ ture of his right bank at the PS@@ V Eindhoven head . &quot;
&quot; while keeping the left outside of weeping and closing it for at least six months of play , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot;
&quot; the violation was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was entering the PS@@ V area . &quot;
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and used oxygen before he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg press and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
he had an oxygen mask on the changing cabin .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor but if you have twice fra@@ cture , it lasts for six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbit@@ rators had er@@ red .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were pr@@ one . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et at Sha@@ ws account described : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I &apos;m , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
referring to : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ ender has added an additional inc@@ entive to recover from June to next June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the space of injury to the place , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the goal of our player to viol@@ ate an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg cr@@ ab@@ ort when Mexico fought against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very serious violation , it is not good , &quot;
it wasn &apos;t possible for me to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was going on a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel really bad . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing to learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost . &quot;
&quot; unless , you &apos;re possibly David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the super @-@ camps , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to give my children , because it always seems to have missed an image or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything was nice and good , except for the following paragraph , in which Cameron describes the plot of film version of 2012 , added a summary of the movie version of 2012 , added to the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; am@@ id@@ st the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey , met her wish to meet a real tree , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage ho@@ stage , and who passed away in 1991 , is completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that wasn &apos;t even susp@@ ect enough : the text was featured on the website of the Lor@@ ax Films , which is all artificial and even the air is a commodity , which is all artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes that a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ drey , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he imp@@ lies to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron speaks the action of the book as little . here , an un@@ named boy , as the local environment speaks through the sp@@ elled Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ wling , scarlet rib@@ bon , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a helper that The Lor@@ ax had not read 20 times during a row . &quot;
a Do@@ wning Street spokesperson said that the text might probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos; election office .
&quot; super@@ camps confirm that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th is clearly threatened by the exclusion from English , but it is still hard &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , there is a difficult task , but if one has selected the Ka@@ das , the England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not in my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de an out@@ ward victory .
&quot; the Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing @-@ list , and the community is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een Ali evol@@ ves with the ball as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
locally @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ d@@ sh@@ out from the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , to me as his principal trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; during his seven test tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that te@@ et@@ te@@ ers are targeted at results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ation , as - and I said these things to be their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ ons , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss comm@@ ended his attitude , even if he did not give as good achievements , and I am not surprised ; it is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question how much time has a test shock to get his character , is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th gave seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on was nine . &quot;
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and out@@ ward play .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation , which one can rise , was that England was first replaced Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in great shape - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a b@@ ats@@ man , whom I appreciate high . &quot;
he &apos;s a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ one who we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he met with 236 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge right for giving us very much .
&quot; he must receive at least the same chances as those before him , but that depends of course on the team development in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Cook , the idea to suggest Mo@@ ors in addition to Cook , which would get an extra spin @-@ spin and get four qu@@ icks , di@@ pped and I got nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t strike there , and this left hand has shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket type cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ ors may not have his job done to his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests with the first drop before he joined the Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and looked not back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ es as a back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner and in my limited approach he has impressed me as a young man .
&quot; people probably look at his st@@ ats - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think , it &apos;s a point , but there is no big number of Backup Sp@@ inn@@ s who rise up their hands and the co@@ aches have opted for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made some smart supplements in the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a championship coup . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ch of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he &apos;s created for the international cri@@ cket contest , than players or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the changing booth can fresh , even if the news appeared in line with that previously said . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used by the One @-@ Day@@ e , R@@ oot was given a similar pause against Australia and I mean no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team manufacturers do not define the schedule . &quot;
&quot; and you need to remember , that , as with players , their jobs will depend on the results . &quot;
such decisions are not appe@@ aled to the heart .
Bre@@ xit of Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit in Great Britain from the EU ) could appro@@ ve an end to Zul@@ u &apos;s economy from the EU until 2017 .

&quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it doesn &apos;t like it , if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed social protection . &quot;

&quot; my European friend , who wants to feel an outside Britain out of the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and goes through to point out that more and more short @-@ wise ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s war@@ y German Angela Merkel is a ally but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her as it happens during the excessive per@@ sever@@ ing such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) and Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande is looking forward to re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ asted strength .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist rights government , Spain , in Spain . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Brit@@ ons to help prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want to get from the UK because most similar separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies have to be met . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some of such ministers may not plan well @-@ free remarks , at the SN@@ P @-@ style , while British refer@@ end@@ ums in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit , please refer to my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was an Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how much the Fle@@ et Street is able to use and which EU scep@@ tics have been the Oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press bar@@ ons , but did not support it during that of Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you may remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro con@@ cili@@ ation@@ ships , who made up a name than a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade Ban@@ ana &quot; in Brussels in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; with all his de@@ vot@@ ees , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ car@@ ni@@ ches , telephone @-@ h@@ itting foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who have most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , they are better distributed to di@@ stra@@ ct him , instead of becoming a lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he turned himself with Cam@@ er@@ ons of Speaker , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ passed Constitution of the EU , which was then turned down by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 , which opened it into a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice block Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly little bit on Monday in Westminster on Monday - I said that he had no time for me to disgu@@ ise me - seems to be repeated in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch fired at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take time , but he needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa is left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I press it kind - in development .
he says we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ef@@ ish tendency and the wild Ge@@ fil@@ ment of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; a Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in radio and television this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs in him fought , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ ies , when his old father was on TV in the way to be loyal to his Labour Central Cab@@ inet , to go too far and lose his cabin b@@ job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , to remain &quot; under all conditions &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow fighters and MPs according to all reports on Monday night . &quot;
whatever the touching up @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ en doesn &apos;t want to con@@ vey that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no freedom card for Europe , which allows him to maintain care@@ ers support in the Speaker campaign for independence , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are fundamental and am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ess economy , their anti @-@ capitalist system - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , for which the nar@@ c@@ issu@@ ance of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Watson feels firmly that J@@ C will not begin the outlet , a foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense to their superior su@@ peri@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin adopt political capital , - they also have mis@@ chie@@ v@@ ous elec@@ tors - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all of these can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the United States are already fairly disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and in Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which was inspired by British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts crit@@ ici@@ zing Public Health England about e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking were created from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industries , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by crit@@ ici@@ zing the duration of e @-@ cigarettes in their report about e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; fundamental report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have set the load capacity of data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; two other researchers write to BM@@ J , asking if the alleg@@ ations are built on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Relations East Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking at a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement consists of a single meeting of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for multi @-@ critical criteria ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to produce their opinions on the damage of different nic@@ ot@@ ine products ; the results of the meeting were group@@ ed together in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco Directive ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes company , but not the financing , which he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , add them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of members of the Gre@@ ase are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide some branches of branches in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line also took part of P@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s research collaboration says that there is a lack of &quot; heavy evidence for the damage of most products &quot; most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , there will be no debate on these links or limitations in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; it has no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking were used . &quot;
&quot; according to pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said it had already responded to the claims about BM@@ J . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smoking dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small , but that we continue to study the long term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the clear duty to the public information about what the evidence shows , and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80,000 people die yearly at cancer with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national healthcare system two billion £ per year . &quot;
&quot; clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , a former leader of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop working programmes like East@@ ter@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival will give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said the radio fee would only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC to publicly broad@@ cast@@ ed the public broad@@ caster , which probably will be viewed by a smaller audience in hard @-@ disputed time@@ frames against the most popular shows of their rival , and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said that the Company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get into contact with Channel 4 for six years . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programs would be on behalf or send them clearly not subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee in the context of his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the radio fee , what I keep in medium or long term , you should at least make his production at least on programs that do not make or commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they will send the Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to reach a wide support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why it funded such res@@ sive tax programs that could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ ter@@ En@@ ders is another ad@@ mitt@@ edly ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own production . &quot;
frank@@ ly other channels would give their right arm .
I stri@@ ve to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would actually decrease the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC to blame on the hunt for reviews was &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give it again , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ CO@@ O performance in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC plans to sell shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal framework program should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue that when they go to their close sacred missions to justify the annual production of 4 billion pounds . &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these above programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they place them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; at the radio fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more rainy system in terms of conditions who can get the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all , we think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who is a lot of money for the £ 150 per year , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to review and maintain their attraction mission . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education . he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should have a look at the publicly @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC was to do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will go to and with the commercial transm@@ itting Alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can ste@@ er brain cells via sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses .
&quot; scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by waves of sound waves . &quot;
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they have too high frequencies for the human hearing , to be heard . &quot;
imp@@ ul@@ ses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to son@@ ic@@ ator .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said , the worms showed the power of a new trial called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , in order to be able to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , inv@@ asive ul@@ ses to the brain of suffer@@ ers of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; tor@@ ment@@ ers usually react on ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani states that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bli@@ sters , he found out , rein@@ forces the ultr@@ asound , then entering into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultr@@ asonic forces operate on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 , and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the dice cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves do the opening of these ion channels , activate the cells that they are assigned , according to a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asound made of Nem@@ ato@@ des , Cal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions have to carry from TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when he is an ultr@@ asound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by micro@@ bl@@ ers and transferred into the worms , where they switch off the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a pioneering tool that enables scientists to connect neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ at@@ ani could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that must be sent down in optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound mal@@ ign@@ es can occur un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain of top on the skull . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with the therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible , the targeted human neur@@ ons are temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical practice for certain neuro@@ logical treatment , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

the 300 posters are artists who have their work exhibited in the Museum of Cru@@ el Designs in Ban@@ ks@@ ys Dis@@ mal@@ and .

&quot; according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ in@@ don , curator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists are critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries . &quot;
many artists make activists in protest movements at work and notice that they have to go outside in the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade uni@@ gre@@ ets greeting the passes in the subway .
&quot; the Am@@ nesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works for non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ice@@ over artist who also works for free . &quot;
&quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ creative director Matt Le@@ ver was surprised by the silence that existed for the fair trade fair - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; played with the invention of a realistic sc@@ at@@ ly layer of corporate advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright paints and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job , giving us the awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need right now is a blow from the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment would not be marketed before our front door .
maybe the most creative art is around the arms trade dates back within the area within Excel where Ex@@ hibit@@ ors are fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residence
&quot; 11 years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral loc@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the ten@@ ant smile of those who I stum@@ bled - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules . &quot;
the move in student residence ranges from slightly ner@@ able up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to slaughter : people tell whence you are getting to know if you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ en and why you don &apos;t love to hate you because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it l@@ ates the conversation and helps you find out the people that you might not speak compared to those with whom you do not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were in fire , and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to : do not think of starting at the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted obtain@@ ing a gross treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room w@@ ander culture that can lead both friendly and soci@@ ally and to li@@ fel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone , trying to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I love you , and I want our friendship along , but you have to go away so I get back the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted by soci@@ ability - and send him an SMS instead .
you can click the apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship so@@ da through baking .
&quot; as you begin the university at the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ ds at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something baked to you . so , and now please smile once you give you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats to offer is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates are obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and become at the end perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
of course it depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker .
&quot; po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump made of flour , sugar and fat , letting them sleeping sleep when you click . &quot;
to steal food is an common crime in student dwell@@ ings .
&quot; of course , chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea ? &quot;
check out the quality owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook in interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you feel my compassion - but try to get more balanced than my co @-@ resi@@ ded that added to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; you shouldn &apos;t do any noise , people from sleep or from work . &quot;
&quot; it is not only about being a person to be a person , but that you belong in the true meaning of the pro@@ ver@@ b to people who are sitting in the gl@@ ass@@ room . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , if it makes them a little more quiet , drum &amp; bass driver a little qui@@ eter than at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had an exam in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted on it with still l@@ ur@@ king music .
&quot; when they finally heard about 5 p.m. , their neighbours ch@@ oked up again two hours before they left their own music , shut down their door and set off in their three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
would it not be romantic when you would turn into the same residence by chance in the same residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be sm@@ other@@ ly embar@@ rass@@ ing if you have to take a resident of your future wife partner to take part in and seeing them every day , and perhaps see how they all interpre@@ t all of their common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart runs its own way - but if a hot co @-@ resident is definitely not your future wife partner , try to persu@@ ade your lower mind to reason . &quot;
&quot; at the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has the key in its un@@ closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ a when it appears . &quot;
&quot; a good battle is funny , but it only lasts moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; share a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security , yet never fail to any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo . &quot;
&quot; shut down your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t worry about their owners at the ceiling , not more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , y@@ ard@@ ants , and Ger@@ mer@@ ers &quot;
the real estate of Mark Gu@@ dner reli@@ es for people who have not much money in the mid @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ener terra@@ ced houses .
&quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living space , but also the only educ@@ ating Mother and the Ger@@ mer@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in an interview , I show how to build and finish today &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the housing market .
&quot; entrepren@@ eur Mark Gu@@ dner to know how swi@@ ft@@ ly non @-@ advant@@ ageous homes can be created , he builds for refugees in a project . &quot;
Mr. Gil@@ dner ; many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution offer you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : optimal accommodation in containers and gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people staying in a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need a living room for over the next decades . &quot;
a completely new and three @-@ storey building house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town house needs the least space .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
this is different if the people are living in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses built just in the pilot project , consists of three units for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can be re@@ arranged according to the needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without property . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the building took six months .
that is reasonable .
do the construction regulations simpli@@ fy their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I am subject to my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated there is the threatened Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth special construction and parking placement .
gr@@ ass@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still sub@@ set , who creates three apartments in a row @-@ house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities are missing the place .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the people react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury constructions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but don &apos;t you tigh@@ ten the compet@@ itor &apos;s compet@@ itor ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : we have made a building boom in Germany last five years , but there were luxury apartments that can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , as well as normal people need a living room . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only m@@ aturing mother , or the Ger@@ mer@@ ers . &quot;
I will show how to build and build well today .
that is why .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; General &quot; , &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are encountered after the installation , because they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users are recommended to wait either to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght go back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .

at this point the group was at the b@@ ft station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
&quot; one of these men , the young man cried , and struck this with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nose wound and ble@@ ached out of the nose .
&quot; as his two friends were ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ as@@ ingly to the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs , this first caused by his victims . &quot;
&quot; of his friends , the injured young man was brought home now . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators increased the same group with a car to their apartment and passed much more demonstr@@ atively .
&quot; when one saw the car , the last one went before the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; using a beat @-@ up of a stroke rate , one looked at the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;

Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows .
&quot; also , Sam@@ bu@@ ds natur@@ alist Bernd Bor@@ mann , Minister of Economic Research , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs , Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert , also delight . &quot;
&quot; in many places on the country , physicians - As@@ endorf will have luck : on 1 October , Dr. Frank Müller is taking over the practice of Fel@@ c@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor is still on the side for the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October . until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros to the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lows before years ago , Frank Müller , and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently working as a specialist training at the university and will also come into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the garbage would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sm@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I just called it . &quot;
&quot; the couple Müller &apos;s idea , in future , had the idea to operate her own practice in As@@ endorf . &quot;
&quot; the near@@ ness and individual contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to know , and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so , one was agreed , the waste bought the house with practice . &quot;
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there the double family @-@ father Frank Müller has also grown up , his medical studies in Hannover followed the stations in several medical practices and hospitals in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a chief resident in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician at the district of Die@@ ph@@ ol@@ z and comm@@ ited to a volunteer in the DRC @-@ read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from 19 September , the practice of the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ out@@ breaks , as a veter@@ in@@ arian , his wife has specialised in the gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle in home@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians . &quot;
&quot; the End@@ os@@ copy is out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after conversion , the rooms will look modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultr@@ asound tests as well as long @-@ term and power supply EK@@ GS and need more microphone room anymore .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; as part of a funding programme of the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) , the Müll@@ ers get a surplus of € 50@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proudly and happy we are , that the practice will continue , emphas@@ izes the role of Sam@@ imp@@ et@@ ch@@ et@@ aker Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients will come to the practice of professional practice , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter in practice , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another house practice .
a positive aspect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains loud in the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor has found , it would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the speaker &apos;s speaker , you will also be looking to trust in confi@@ dential faces : taking over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force from the rock . &quot;
&quot; during the departure of the end of the era in As@@ endorf , the medicine had been pract@@ ised for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; remembers S@@ sel Fel@@ sm@@ ausen . &quot;
a bit of melanchol@@ y l@@ ur@@ king it after the long time .
&quot; but we are staying further into the Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will often see many patients often , &quot; says the prin@@ cess . &quot;
&quot; her husband is complem@@ ented , &quot; We have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have pushed me down before garden work , now that could become different . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we allow the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are driven even at our southern border , &quot; said interior minister Johanna M@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to establish a demand for asylum may also be &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; but it is clear , too , &quot; that it requires clear signals , &quot; says the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people have to know that we don &apos;t accept trans@@ national migration flows , even not of the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling to Austria and Germany towards Austria and Germany , and you can also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
so this was not the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however not .
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister pointed , Sloven@@ es also wants to unlock its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had tried to arrive at the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d night tour in eastern Croatia in order to exp@@ el the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police landed them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , there will be a contin@@ ual police vehicle with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; there are predominantly around Syrians , Afghanistan , among them women and children . &quot;
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days there is a country of around 4000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border ended which so far had led migrants to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied it , however , that it is , the people rebu@@ ke some of certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; in any case , according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; passengers were traveling through Serbia , at the distance of some 500 kilometres distant from Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so we told the police that we should leave here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it might actually be pre @-@ predicted shifting of former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west @-@ west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities to limit control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country for the fall of a strong state of refugees benef@@ ited for possible situations of potential situations .
&quot; he did not see details , but he pointed out that Croatia did as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for the border control . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to qualify a strict controls , in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners present a good report to the country since then , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on this Hungarian border , approximately 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they have spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border trans@@ itions remain completely blocked by Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining fug@@ es are now going to pass on the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; during the Serbian Interior Minister , Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was on Wednesday morning at a local eye view in Hor@@ g@@ os . he is talking about the debates about Alternative ro@@ ses of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
there would not have been a great number of refugees there .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
aid advice in migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border even 20 years after the end of the conflict , there are still not more cleared min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ de@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire around 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told , of earning a $ 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next year , 20 cents more than at the previous forecast . &quot;
&quot; analysts expected to be submitted to a survey of 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the smaller view is increased despite the price increases , which amounts to an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite the higher scores for transport of heavy and large packages , collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it nonetheless anticipated that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and growth in online retail business . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; the company &quot; &quot; is solid , if one considers the weak@@ ening as an expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;

&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders recognized that there is an un@@ written third term : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too close to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented level of interest in close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest generation of turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets could make the already c@@ auti@@ ous F@@ ed representative to increase this vol@@ atility due to increasing interest rate to federal government - and it is only by one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to observe . &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Head of Economic at the Mak@@ ler@@ itor Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were searching for a pre@@ text to do not raise the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty around the global market enough to justify being continued , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is doing what is un@@ stable on itself the financial market .
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists , who recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a rate of interest this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets , however , anticip@@ ates a wait @-@ to @-@ wait F@@ ed with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists follow the strike by promise that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ ages 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy imposed the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief economist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sets at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , lest they get into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would effectively remove the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed in a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow con@@ ven@@ ous of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that this year despite the appe@@ als of Liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary to increase the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of employment in August slow@@ ed down , improvement was solid on the labour market this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate falling to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to levels that the F@@ ed looks as full job . &quot;
wage gains have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was steadily under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative designated for the main reason for the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and need them for tension in the job market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media . &quot;
&quot; but financial markets gathered around the world over the end of the month , after China had appreciated its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average score fell by more than 16 % below its peak , than investors were afraid that a slow@@ down in China &apos;s economy would stim@@ ulate global growth . &quot;
&quot; this month , the market has re@@ covering a little while the Dow is now around 10 % below the May of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Representative , market turbul@@ ences influence basic calculation whenever you should increase interest . &quot;
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news concerning the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and an ex @-@ president of the US . &quot;
&quot; now , he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty on what the effects on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; global economy is none of the main concern of the F@@ ed , hence they should not be involved in decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Fund of the World has become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could sky@@ rocket its monetary expansion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven together , from the F@@ ed representative they can not only monitor the developments in other areas , but also consulting with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; says Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; F@@ ed has a story of takeover on financial market movements that seem to be linked with the economic foundation data . &quot;
&quot; chi@@ pper , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , added to an interest rate , benef@@ ited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to cut its lead point by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a lim@@ itated impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representative of these cuts are revers@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the committee on interest , said the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the most recent turbul@@ ence are not close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to come into the situation in which they are afraid of interest @-@ rate , because the markets feelings are exciting , &quot; Pos@@ en , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not even mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should be ahead of time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small living help for refugees
more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the engagement of many volunteers .
there are also a whole number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they are among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a body and soul teacher .
she still teaches with her 74 lessons .
&quot; every Thursday , she does an asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Road . &quot;
&quot; there are also refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
of course it &apos;s quite different classes than at a right school .
Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bull
&quot; the Brazilian p@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS attempts to clarify the sho@@ cking way women on it , how important good food is during stand@@ still . you do this with the presentation of images of babies that painted with breasts of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all nutrients which they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that should be carried out mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women affects the gen@@ etics of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ours in front of the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of child may affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ut Hall of sports hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ried offers an application for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ extended turn@@ outs at the Bern@@ ina Sports site take step @-@ by step forward : the most recent building application was blessed in the most recent construction application without great discussions .
&quot; previously , the panel also had an application for a mandatory &quot; exception &quot; respec@@ ting &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the exception , &quot; it was permitted to permit a special form for a special form . &quot;
a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ able first and roof overhead is to be built .
&quot; the planned use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large holiday roof , &quot; stated mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; during &quot; Liberation , &quot; it again went around the roof , that should be prescribed for energy reasons - unlike the development of the development of ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; thus , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; Liberation &quot; was therefore needed , because the development plan regarding the roof incl@@ ination does not permit a &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ina Par@@ der@@ at will typically experience restri@@ ctive rules for the deliver@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; the gym is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent &quot; , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym @-@ construction at the sports center is a community project of the community and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; costs , some 2.3 million euros have calculated . &quot;
supplements are expected from school and lat@@ itude levels .
&quot; in the next step of process the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now t@@ abled for testing . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed sooner than planned - namely in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed the new medical director at hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees take from P@@ ei@@ ran berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is the surprising plans of the hospital , the District Court , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on the rest of the Supervisory Board , and the rest on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were implemented , all of the almost 50 staff would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should move through Fischer and the continuing existing station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the staff , who cannot go with ong@@ au , should be offered at home in W@@ eil@@ heim , thus J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; it has caused the change to termin@@ ate Dr. Andreas E@@ der , which has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to take over will come to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game which was willing to take over the line from 1 October to take over the line and with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this puts it in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inner centre .
&quot; as a result of the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board is right to manage both houses , until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ esset , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the county has planned this for 2018 , if the current ongoing renovation work at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim is completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , has become a rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Rail@@ pool , will now be used as accommodation for asylum mobile . &quot;
&quot; this I close . &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several consider@@ ations . &quot;
there are currently a short @-@ time nursing care of Car@@ itas and a tag@@ onal psychology .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity isn &apos;t going to come again , &quot; said fishermen over the quota to the Le@@ ch , which has been &quot; positive and very understand@@ able . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which has been working as che@@ er for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he has been asked by P@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in the past decades the hospital P@@ ei@@ ran berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened by closure , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Rhein @-@ Neckar lions are called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 a.m. ) at Berg@@ isches HC .
&quot; in fact , the table leader in the league is in Wuppertal the clear favorite , and none of them exists . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener sets a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and have a little bit worried there . &quot;
Jag@@ dun@@ fall with two last at Pr@@ at@@ au
two Tra@@ ctor @-@ wheel@@ ers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest at the morning afternoon .
&quot; during Aber@@ deen on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( county of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police shared . &quot;
&quot; after defe@@ ating the 63@@ - and a 22 year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries , and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; as it could happen in the accident , it was initially un@@ clear . &quot;
the crimin@@ als were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
one of the susp@@ ects has led the police to the Lei@@ che who has been missing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old people who killed young people and threw their bodies into one channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a victim of violence for a victim of violence .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s wom@@ ens was found on Tuesday evening in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosecutor and police came out on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; a also suspected 20 @-@ year @-@ old man , who , indeed , was suspected and investig@@ ating the investig@@ ator to the loc@@ ality of the dead . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning , after she had been working at home on the eve after a visit of a autumn year in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; when looking for the young woman , investig@@ ators first ran on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in cases of friends in friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances , which resulted in a susp@@ icious attitude towards the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police onto a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot;
&quot; the authorities have taken inter@@ rog@@ ation by the authorities to be inter@@ rog@@ ation by the police , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the bodies were put in the canal . &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented in the evening of the harbour ; investig@@ ators are laying the burden on load .
&quot; in fact , beyond the circumstances , further investigations should take further investigation . &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing
the situation on the German housing market is st@@ ably ten@@ se .
more refugees seek a paid lead .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution competition on the German housing market has long ago .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and unemployed people from the EU , more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with income to in@@ corporate citizens in the last affordable dwell@@ ings .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; on this outcome , a study was commissioned to work on behalf of the &quot; social housing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; this means 14@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required than asylum seek@@ ers in a first shelter stay . &quot;
many spur@@ ts on the housing market and rows into the long qu@@ eu@@ es in front of the rentals .
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Statist@@ ical Office , however , less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers arrived last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market does not only lie to the increasing number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant decrease in residential construction policy of the last years .
Germany Sli@@ de is a residential building prior to getting bigger from year to year .
&quot; according to the currently employed in metro@@ politan areas around 77@@ 0.000 residential units , Matthias Günther is benef@@ iting from the study . &quot;
many voc@@ ations therefore stayed in major cities in the WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ intenti@@ onally on the farm market no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve this problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot;
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to boost social housing again .
&quot; thus , the tax @-@ based tax could be wai@@ ved , and the property taxes for funded dwell@@ ings will be suspended . &quot;
&quot; to this date , the Alliance has provided an attractive fiscal and easy @-@ to @-@ run possibilities . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters of state bank Kf@@ W are now well connected in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was announced in the Monday evening with € 184 million , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros have been announced . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free posts : Croatia and Slovenia corridor
&quot; there is practically no coming from Hungary to Hungary , because more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring countries of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Slovenian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria , and is already a Schengen area . &quot;
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; after the en@@ forcement of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken into Croatia to get to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV broad@@ caster RTL reports . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its borders to refugees in the day before .
new laws that have been in effect on the same day will be practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to allow the refugees to happen .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; they can enter , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police arrested the first refugees on the border of Serbia in the morning to the EU @-@ neighbouring country Croatia .
&quot; most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and Tax@@ es in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to go beyond the green border to Croatia . &quot;
the refugees do not stum@@ ble onto the Croatian @-@ Serb border .
this is the limit of other dangers : there are sharp leads from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mining metho@@ des are now supposed to be a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , after the closing of the border , there are hardly any refugees . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 registered people . &quot;
shortly before the door on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
&quot; the new Hungarian laws , the over@@ coming and damage of the border dispute as an off@@ ender . &quot;
thus 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
&quot; they thre@@ aten the sentences of pen@@ alties , to five years , and the deportation out of the land . &quot;
&quot; according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications had been used on Tuesday in the newly @-@ furnished &quot; tran@@ se@@ ons , &quot; of which almost every - 93 - is the most important R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the App@@ lic@@ ants : 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there was still 40 refugees detained .
&quot; practically speaking , nobody has a view to be granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the granted asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
&quot; just a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , just a few hundred refugees . &quot;
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to re@@ boot . &quot;
you raised the garbage to leave the tens of thousands of people over the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
pl@@ ywood were dismant@@ led and one of the hop@@ per in the border area was rebuilt .
&quot; for the purpose of this building , nobody wanted to express itself . &quot;
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls . &quot;
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still held in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg some 1400 people wait for the drive to Germany .
the train to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities on the morning .
in Freil@@ assing met regularly smaller groups of refugees .
Mayor drove &quot; conf@@ essions &quot; on the border
&quot; we were after the bridge festival on Sunday with the swe@@ aters , when suddenly there were ten people with travel officers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ i may@@ ors Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists wanted to travel with the train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany was un@@ aware of the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , but it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help with two other helicop@@ ters and their cars over the border into the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before that , we first took the un@@ ai@@ ded guests only once , with snack and beverages . &quot;
&quot; we said , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man left not to receive a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this was very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the stran@@ ded access passengers were embar@@ ked on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a train to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening , in order to quit the railway traffic after Germany , but to try again over the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was dis@@ closed before the B@@ ern@@ stein border at Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ border is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the mosquito union association with the Bavarian neighbours will be travelling on Sunday , a day before a cross @-@ bridge sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án have now sending more ten@@ sions to us - is a logical result of a apparent policy :
&quot; instead of working in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , our Chancellor hosted highly officially and publicly announced the position of the Hungarian Government in the Dun@@ geons of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; supporting this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions now . &quot;
&quot; the poultry sector will also have to determine that the &quot; &quot; gel@@ ded country &quot; &quot; that they invited and welcomed are nothing than another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; in view of the persistent refugee flow and the approaching n@@ igh@@ ters , a decent area for protective seek@@ ers will continue with us . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater strength - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the search of 35,000 new for@@ war@@ ers &quot;
Konrad has fully forced to do all hands with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is always familiar with his word weight .
&quot; the government has used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank , to set up qu@@ arti@@ ere for thousands of refugees . &quot;
the chaos at the beginning of the Com@@ is@@ kirchen School has already gotten a grip .
&quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees benef@@ ited from Austria on Monday to Austria , said : Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; masterpiece . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry noted , however , from a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad is expecting a total of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the hec@@ tic year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35,000 accommodation must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 the countries provide to provide 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no barrel without soil , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the national govern@@ ors , he has already led talks . &quot;
&quot; they would have been assured against him , even to the upcoming Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; he runs well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
the asylum Coordin@@ ator uses an ongoing commitment to the ORF action as well as we are . &quot;

&quot; additionally , one is hoping for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation than &quot; very high . &quot;
at times it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ator must have a certain height of hand@@ tu@@ b@@ holder or size of the upper eyel@@ ets .
for a temporary time &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be considered .
&quot; contrary to the Interior &apos;s Interior , he has been successful with his experience in contrast to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
I am an elderly person in which I am not without further face to the ignor@@ ance .
over@@ power@@ ing force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er does not cause the Republic to have any cost as they themselves explained .
your employees want to increase them to three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ search has not been successful yet .
Konrad didn &apos;t want to establish a container as an office at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz .

Linz calls for a better split
&quot; first , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is currently not necessary , because the concerning the parties to bring with these measures , Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) says . &quot;
&quot; for emergency , however , further sites are expected to be tested on their capability . &quot;
criticism of the city council in the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to afford their contribution here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister , Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , the state General Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) ordered the further procedure in refugee en@@ quiry on Monday . &quot;
See@@ hofer gave me as@@ sures that the German borders will not be mir@@ ro@@ red .
the further travel from refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continue to be possible .
however there are now the appropriate border controls .
there will no longer be available to refugees with refugees in Germany .
&quot; however , the shelter would be moved with regular trains to Germany . &quot;
P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger demanded more intense solidarity in the refugee question by the other EU member states .
&quot; it is a logical consequence , that Austria , once again led to its borders , is a logical result of P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the line of plants is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the publicly tra@@ cked IT company S &amp; T moved , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies out of the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine to invest in the new ship@@ yard in start@@ up companies , and later as to ak@@ in . &quot;
&quot; starting from the beginning , S &amp; T with the new neighbours will cooperate with the new neighbours - down from down to down : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that 1.7 million euros have been invested in the location of S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Federal State ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is provided by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of total 2700 square meters of residual area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there in@@ quiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened the second shop in the arcade
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags stand in the centre in the new shop .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ a wanted to outline a dog .
&quot; this project had to run the 49 @-@ year @-@ old incar@@ nation of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the divers market @-@ arcade : finally , it has now been an increase in form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , in front of the business , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , all about the hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are available from 75 euros . &quot;
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before that , several weeks changed . &quot;
&quot; but I have a long time reas@@ oning , though I should open a shop , &quot; Bre@@ it says . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among others that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of its own site , where only their hand@@ bags are sold , were driven . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the big city of Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion @-@ interest has been given to the cra@@ dle of her mother .
&quot; I share the most , though something developed and I can show new trends at high prices . &quot;
&quot; why such a woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ra@@ pture , also the specialist maid can not answer the last security . &quot;
perhaps it &apos;s possible that this beautiful bag evalu@@ ates every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ ar macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ c@@ or .
this property also connects man@@ cher with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he expresses an alien &apos;s host@@ ile , rep@@ orters or tri@@ but@@ s in the international crisis policy - candidate for the US Presi@@ dential candidate ra@@ ged the election campaign . &quot;
and you cut off well .
it is also registered in the for@@ gery K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate can come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a big idea in Win@@ de@@ dorf on the winery .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants place is over -@@ old corners with it related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned over a movie via dump .
&quot; what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think that somehow find exciting , but they were not so deeply impressed with their K@@ all@@ ish kind , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spra@@ wling , among which Heinz counts also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; dump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; for the king of the heart , he has not brought it there . &quot;
&quot; indeed , respect for the achievement of the family , but also ten@@ ds to say that Tr@@ ump is already a bit yo@@ m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; co@@ incid@@ entally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in a circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to High @-@ German : the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ c@@ or . &quot;
the success story began in 1885 as the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the property company was first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but life of grand@@ parents was not free of business : their wish to return to the home in the Bavarian state , in which the Palat@@ inate was stopped . &quot;
&quot; he did not know Tr@@ ump , because once he was hon@@ ed without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Urban History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared a movie start . &quot;
cl@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ts statements of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly requested over Mexican immigrants in the US and requested the construction of a border wall to deter those immigrants .
&quot; as p@@ added , that is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ relative tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , Op@@ a was borro@@ wed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anz@@ ted , &quot; he &apos;s always so many thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump happens again ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never took care of K@@ all@@ as , however . &quot;
the pension ten@@ se in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons like man@@ ly K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit to the church organ that was generally well approached .
&quot; that can &apos;t imagine the Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he won &apos;t win the choice , because &quot; it has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had begun at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been like he , &quot; he never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ ner @-@ maker Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; says she . &quot;
&quot; and , &quot; the grapes are ripe , without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot;
&quot; W@@ end@@ els movie , interviewed for the tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ gles , also in the US wake up interest . &quot;

&quot; this down@@ side of the insur@@ rection seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capit@@ als , in comparison with Today 33@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today Today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) . &quot;
Today I closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in the last months .
&quot; in August , Today , on average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.000 and 50.000 . &quot;

&quot; the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of 800 words , ra@@ fting Erik Thomson . &quot;
&quot; the new drama on a dis@@ com@@ promised father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the northern New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wonder@@ ing if Thomson encountered a hit show Solo without the ra@@ cket Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &apos; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and slightly pushed the block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results at evening two of The Chase Australia .
&quot; the first half @-@ hour ( 17 : 00 to 17,@@ 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe and an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
the second half @-@ hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; the first half hour from The Chase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 were recorded . &quot;
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be highly confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately succeed at 17 : 30 .

the last three voices : bach@@ elor &apos;s Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are possibly un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly known who wins the bach@@ elor &apos;s degree . &quot;
the woman who eventually landed in The Bachelor &apos;s degree in The Bachelor &apos;s degree was covered in the largest sec@@ rec@@ y .
&quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give thanks , whether it is the one who received the last Rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we were with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before coming from three two , you possibly accid@@ entally obtained a hint on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues its lips to the final on Thursday .
&quot; all three women left out in ly@@ rical ways , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense in humor , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive attitude as a reason why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get the last Rose ? &quot; they might become their answers to the game destro@@ yers , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki named themselves both quickly , except for themselves - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood . &quot;
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sarajevo ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed I felt that they were fairly well compatible , and I thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet on the earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their view , Mack@@ ay reported that the last week &apos;s visit made it clear that Wood &apos;s &quot; One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realised that this was obviously not just a game - I &apos;m going back to it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked who Wood to choose who Wood was to choose , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know whether I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s degree is broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL series .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams , who sent in@@ quiries about his stunning open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and he looks like a clever decision .
&quot; some train@@ ers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a min@@ d@@ f , as it was the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League conver@@ gence at its first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted her husband and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after an infr@@ in@@ gement of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; rather than grin@@ d his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sports reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by custom teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ron@@ age and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne sc@@ r@@ ents by a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota &apos;s Vik@@ ings .
it certainly was not the start to Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian en@@ folds for his N@@ FL debut .

&quot; this was a thing , which now occurs , one takes care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ on compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Origin in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ going field to a T@@ ry for Queensland . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot at protest@@ ers in Nepal
&quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after police were shot in a crowd that demonstrated the proposed new constitution , an officer on Wednesday said . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday night at Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of whom threw stones and fire@@ bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police had used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , and then shot in the air before they returned to Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de . &quot;
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why they could kill the rubber floor , of which they can kill , but traditionally used as less le@@ thal alternative , apparently such a high death rate produced . &quot;
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protest at Nepal as southern levels where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ri@@ mon@@ ial said that new provinces are formed under the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want to have their own state .
&quot; about 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been disp@@ le@@ ased in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; killed as the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled by centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature has accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
the law@@ makers have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

the preparations are currently underway .
&quot; the grounds for a mix of trade , commerce and housing are planned . &quot;
&quot; we are waiting for corresponding offers , i.e. , by the city . &quot;
&quot; which investor is coming , is not yet clear . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , there were no agreements to be signed . &quot;
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the plot , which is located at the ring road / corner Grand Street , already in front of a few months ago and that the building still leaves behind . &quot;

now the plans for a new holiday resort on the little sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; system construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point was standing on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;

Google will launch a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign that aims to raise € 11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees benef@@ iting from the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of leaving a manager about the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google @-@ employee , who had fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old to her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; there were many dark spots and bus rides , such as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; however , as the refugees and migrants have grown in Europe , many people look desper@@ ate for help in my family . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global donations needed to increase up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / X@@ er@@ el@@ ief to € 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , mostly caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

&quot; for slightly advanced diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight @-@ loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last after a new study at least five years .
&quot; it &apos;s too early to say , whether easy , overweight people with diabetes , after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not get surgical treatment . &quot;
&quot; the mortality data will require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in the weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , using different methods to reduce size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity have been induced to the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were carried out in people who are rout@@ in@@ ely ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese .
you can charge your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min . Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , and compare two types of obesity surgery - magnesium b@@ ypass and stomach mu@@ co@@ stum@@ - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes , which were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BMI below those who underwent surgery , decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the BMI in those who do not surgical surgical treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those working with a surgical procedure , the diabetes disease dis@@ b@@ anded in 36 % and partially at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , however , diabetes solved fully only by one percent , and partly by just about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were positive in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ de , and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins , generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also overs@@ aw the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the glucose levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held below 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels of around 9 percent declined to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - does not reduce the mortality rate in five years , as the expl@@ aining researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also obtained average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) compared to the gastro@@ intestinal surgery group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , and increased more than the overall positive onset of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit from the surgery after five years , there are evidence of a study heavy humans in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , Black@@ stone says from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was under@@ going fat @-@ loving people who underwent an obesity operation , some 29 percent less likely to die during the course of 15 years - in comparison to a group treated by conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s cal@@ ming for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the process . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower at that lower BMI Group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long , until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated this genetic changes , having firmly connected their body with obesity and diabetes , reverse is really difficult . &quot;

it is impossible for everyone to get to Europe . - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not receive all the refugees , the Dalai Lama added , and added that the real solution in the refugee crisis in the Middle East fell . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called on to stop violence in the refugees of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech during the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion , which is devoted to ethics . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be submitted to the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis are ad@@ mi@@ red ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama engaged in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim nations , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; finally , we have to think about how the killing is decreased in their countries . &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; violence has never resolved these issues , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence , and commenting also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and wrote that the violent reaction of the USA followed a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I have expressed my side in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he put violence and that was imp@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
&quot; in the United States , gyp@@ sy control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that bind heavy alcoholic disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 are increasing , from 3.@@ 266 to 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go into an emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children suffer from disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do to im@@ press your friends or im@@ press a mut@@ ually at the social media . &quot;
&quot; videos on YouTube shows how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a budget , experience . &quot;
you@@ ths allegedly mixed the disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ water to maintain a harder drink .
younger children can be inspired by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and or@@ anges that are very appe@@ aling to children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ant contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with infants you can cause a few sprit@@ zers for alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the University of Kansas Law , the broad@@ caster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not leave a si@@ p whis@@ key , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children are coming , it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently brought four sy@@ ring@@ es from after strawberry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ants in school had been taken into an emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold given by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor , treated her at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ded her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency department .
&quot; doctors headed it overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ń@@ s , CNN . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; out of alcohol , a number of disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , after the swal@@ lowing of the disinf@@ ect@@ ations apparatus , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities assume that the meth@@ anol product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class were planning to pois@@ oned their &quot; teachers &quot; teacher , in order to fill of anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; it reports a police report . &quot;
&quot; the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ant , and banned it out of their space . &quot;
the police viewed the per@@ vers@@ ed plan as &quot; swi@@ vels &quot; and inter@@ disciplinary actions to the school authority .

&quot; currently , de Bo@@ er , an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams together and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .

&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while the United Kingdom ends in total . &quot;

&quot; Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was higher than the GDP growth of 5.5 % , according to the figures for the National Statistics Office ( for dating only ) . &quot;

why I shall be a witness of the execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the Gi@@ fts . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation was already mentioned for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day moved closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell all the story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen will ob@@ serving it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps and I will sit in close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship throughout the months with phone data and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh when we speak .
&quot; the authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to capture a not@@ ebook , and a pin to record what I see . &quot;
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , im@@ part@@ ing my im@@ part@@ ity . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you receive access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained by it .
&quot; she admitted she was saying that &quot; it would have better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had issue with some of the things I have said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses any time .
but he wants to be an international reporter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the relations work of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , Rep@@ ri@@ itor of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit beside me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please refer the series of Podcasts that I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would do him guilty of being a dis@@ advant@@ ageous outcome .
&quot; but I believe that a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood , he is not guilty of murder . &quot;
&quot; sure , I think there is not enough evidence to justify a cause of death . &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be objec@@ tively speaking .
&quot; there will be other rep@@ orters , in which you can turn . &quot;
&quot; what you will get from me is what it means to die a man killing any necessary death . &quot;

&quot; I would like to go to the main street , and I would like my owners to try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I need to think about what I do with my licence .
previously Moo@@ dy had the Bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com a success that the quality management team had attempted to pi@@ on@@ ise his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I &apos;ll be asked when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they certainly should deal with her n@@ oses , because they are trying to deal with me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former CEO of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , is the CEO of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , who became aware of its time and are still today . &quot;
should this make me feel that it is personal ?
has the RV@@ L beha@@ ves and makes people responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am there .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and for@@ ge me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; together with the long lasting cob@@ alt test in Li@@ dar@@ i , the Fru@@ gal levels of the Train@@ ers led to the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching that he said he could have his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the non @-@ lag@@ ging master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ day treatment session &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; after a pack mud or clay had been applied on the horse , which was against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I must take over the full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my co @-@ employees buried mud on the leg .
it could be that evening .
&quot; it could have been so yesterday all the day , so what was like that . &quot;
but it had so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an inquiry into this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one went too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy struggles against ri@@ vals to Ring@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy is called &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring struggles &quot; with his team during the high Storm @-@ winning in Sydney will be allowed on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hard cover to the Storm team after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; exempl@@ ar example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland did not &quot; too good &quot; at R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ ary of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; in the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading coach in his team agree to him because it means that they were worried about the Storm @-@ team .
&quot; it appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson have heard about Ring@@ tone , when they have put us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we have changed in our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . however , in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es at a real focus , and this has achieved the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he has obviously to train a great team . he is therefore probably not acc@@ ust@@ omed to lose it so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny to see how this happens again at this time of time .
Bell@@ amy has identified the idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and reminds its ment@@ or to reminds that Benn@@ o St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a bill of divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play , and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you &apos;ve got this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , making them as they can play . &quot;
&quot; I build up confidence because they &apos;re saying these things , because they &apos;re a bit worried about to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Ro@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I didn &apos;t watched it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and don &apos;t have any points ch@@ att@@ ing ?
for me there are the games plans .
&quot; if they do mention , it means that we will be meeting in a phase still on them . &quot;
&quot; the Storm @-@ Team is free at this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts next morning . &quot;
&quot; Serbia with 200,000 $ deposit to drug abuse &quot;
&quot; a man , who may have a lifetime punishment because of his attempt to come to the property of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , released to Queensland , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested in the last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived in South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he could have the whole amount and that in a café out of a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of flight at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the Tribunal on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of the case , he su@@ cked the police on his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ deb@@ ics mother and step@@ mother had offered a rans@@ om of 200,000 dollars on security to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; following reading the eager explanations of these two persons , it is clear that a real financial burden of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judges For@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone is not enough to keep him away from it , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he de@@ parts from his Australian and his Serbian passport to the police every day and at a starting point of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used the phone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone from an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when it was asleep , log in into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children receiving it from another user . &quot;
the girl would wake up later and discovered the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it by , found the mis@@ leading messages , and al@@ ar@@ ous@@ ed her mother immediately . &quot;
&quot; the police looked after it and saw the five pictures , analysed then computers that were found under the address and found &quot; in @-@ giving &quot; web @-@ resear@@ ches , which used concepts for searching for in@@ appropriate images of children . &quot;
H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he had done it as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile &quot; on the internet &quot; and he then &quot; gave &quot; a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them .
&quot; the state lawyer E@@ ili@@ dh , the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court , said : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he gave him that the search on the computer were performed from him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman , to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; after his talks , he was asked with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos . &quot;
&quot; he said , that he did to enti@@ ce them . &quot;
&quot; he said he was sick of his head when he drinks , and said , &quot; &quot; he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother , and was in the trem@@ or and weeping . &quot;
&quot; she also saw the in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous images on the phone , and con@@ front the accused . &quot;
&quot; the girl became interviewed and said , that the accused was accused of computers and Play@@ station to talk to girls who saw a lot younger than he . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded not guilty to the bill of indictment , to have perpet@@ u@@ ated pictures of children on the 14th of June this year , and not before the Court issued a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the register of sexual off@@ ender , since one can argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element in his off@@ ence . &quot;
sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael give away the sentence until October to receive background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other outstanding cases .
&quot; prior to the date of judgment , he was accepted in the directory of sexual off@@ ender . &quot;

&quot; Stuttgart : christ@@ ening of tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest is expected &quot;
meteor@@ ologist war@@ n of storm in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure reserve across Western Europe , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart shared the current air stream in Stuttgart . &quot;

on Friday the sun reaches the sun again .
it makes it clear : all the two years show off the motor manufacturers at the International Motor Show .
&quot; in 2015 , especially movement among the compact vent@@ ures , this is particularly well sold . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently being asked : roughly 28.@@ 1 percent of the appro@@ vals were registered in this segment , according to the Federal Office of Power ( KBA ) alone in August alone . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( audience days from 17th till 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic design and new luxury cars and luxury cars this year .
one of the biggest pre@@ payment for the German car industry is the Opel Astra which will stand by dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann found at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; the volume model is also well @-@ sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry into the biggest compet@@ itor , VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is available from 16@@ 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which are the first three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;

&quot; a second variation will follow the spring of the estate , which is also shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot;
and what was next to the Astra at the International Motor Show at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault are rele@@ asing the fourth generation of its Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively the fifth to see in a conventional and emphas@@ ized sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the coming next year , the trade is coming next year as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .

&quot; DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed , the compact car model DS 4 , which is shown at the International Motor Show . &quot;
&quot; the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er , on the front , laid hands on the front section : the radiator gr@@ ille was newly painted and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the inner room , above all the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced through a touch screen and is the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square cell cell are human .
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ mate of the Te@@ gel pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary law that was housed in a small cell for months .
&quot; due to the violation of their human rights , prisoners are basically eligible for financial compensation when they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision rendered its decision by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected may even hope to have the judges on money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with approximately five square metres of ground floor between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated from space . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who has gone on an open foot according to his lawyer , was re@@ located in a larger cell . &quot;
his mandate agree because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the State of Berlin actually fail .
but the Constitutional Judge took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appeal in Berlin and rep@@ elled the case for a new test .
they see the human being viol@@ ated .
Chamber of Ar@@ bit@@ ration now decides about the amount of the compensation
&quot; even if legal reasons for the question@@ able period are only a few days of detention for the compensation to be decisive , a compensation was given , it promised . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a per@@ sever@@ ance of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of chamber must now clarify the amount of money damage .
the Constitutional Judge often have strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they only said in April of a prisoner for damages because he was imprisoned in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is the decision of 2011 according to the multi @-@ allocation of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed the Constitutional Court , which an in@@ mate in a parallel event in November 2009 confirmed a decent housing . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place daily from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case . &quot;
the Berlin @-@ based pris@@ ons were also hit by the head@@ lines in the last weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours including the aggressi@@ veness , even to fight , it is certainly supposed to have occurred because of the ten@@ sion@@ ed situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the information of the judicial service , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to youth def@@ ences , 19 are supposed to fall away . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the Refu@@ gee Agency : &quot; we do that &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what &apos;s coming to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of Malta this year , following the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates in view of the unusual challenge determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that .
&quot; what comes to Germany , con@@ veys the following overview . &quot;
&quot; after a different progn@@ osis of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments every year , the next five years are expected . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatically , but particularly at affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are coming out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly advant@@ ageous apartments . &quot;
&quot; for that reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double its funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is the perspective of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments have to develop annually and therefore , the agreement should have to invest about 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and Federal Minister for Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany had not been asked systematically after their quali@@ fications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; it is the key to social contacts , for appreci@@ ating in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , &quot; says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political turn in Germany : the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a prohibition of employment for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , and asylum seek@@ ers were limited to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , too , - due to lack of lack of lack - even the visibility due to approach to the employment market should be possible . &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the job market are missing German .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient offer in general and occupational language courses . &quot;
research shows that jobs in the most common are communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
the network of networks is therefore the Königs@@ weg path to labor integration .
&quot; the Berlin school management has found that only a few of her parents immig@@ rated their children to the kit@@ es , estimated at ten to 15 percent . &quot; &quot; it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ y , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to convince the family of the K@@ ita , the administration boards in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand of Er@@ zie@@ her@@ men would rise steep@@ ly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacities , i.e. , by decreasing more technical colle@@ ges . &quot;
students in the countries are prepared with language skills in superior categories on the class@@ room .
&quot; but they are not always taught by trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ ings from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German student works estimates that 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ led the study - the only exception to date Berlin , Dom@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its attitude but abandoned . &quot;
study of refugees could be facil@@ itated access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit , or Dul@@ ce , do not receive services after the asylum seek@@ ers of asylum , when they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , basically , do not get an af@@ let , since it does not fall among the circle of supp@@ ression persons . &quot;
&quot; the refugees had to have lived in Germany so far to have been born four years in Germany to be eligible for Af@@ ö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also this financing piece needs to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student works . &quot;
the students should immediately get ash@@ af@@ ers .
&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
the state should have gradually protected the same rights as they have the churches and develop the existing state churches to develop a new state religion relationship .
the creation of a Islamic charity Federation is also important in order to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
so the representative of Islam must unite to clear contacts and to cooperate with the state in many areas and to engage certain control options .
&quot; to this end , he also involves the read@@ iness to take heed to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern the concern , religious conflicts also could be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; as regards those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on arab@@ ic .
integration will be much more in future than today a topic of all society .
&quot; in this way , the majority of society will have to change , becoming a reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; Germany , - as a result of European choices , has been an Anti @-@ discrimination Office and a General Equality Act since a decade . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NSU trial series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant workers and the stakeholders are non @-@ white German already demanding and why international agreements are to be reality in the coming years if the country will remain peace@@ fully and its new citizens should benefit their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of ensuring future refugees to be medi@@ cally cared for by Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we do this , &quot; he said the daily mirror . &quot;
additional money should flow into the system .
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , who would like to hire health cards similar to the registration of healthcare cards . &quot;
&quot; later , services could be reck@@ oned with the federal states later . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to retri@@ eve so many people with the limited power catalog , to present the asylum seek@@ ers law . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors have to create the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , so far , the Berlin healthcare scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de proved to be worse than other patients were cleared worse than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , have to be paid for interpre@@ ting costs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many refugees could also be helped with more gener@@ als in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; on the occasion of the Refu@@ gee Council , there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the young people it go about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; some other diseases , German doctors from their vocational training but clearly stated , Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite s@@ ulation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize . and , as for the doctors , a possibly even alle@@ vi@@ ation of refugees is possibly in sight . &quot;
the Syrians have a highly developed educational system ; some refugees are even doctors .
&quot; in order to be practic@@ ing , however , they would have to re@@ prove their qualification and dis@@ qualification again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany arrived in Germany according to estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ eutic Ass@@ ets ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) ; most of them suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress situations or depression .
&quot; particularly vulnerable to the refugee kids , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains President of the B@@ Pt@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study of the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp has trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
&quot; who is ill at a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , suffers from other things @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart @-@ pac@@ ed and ob@@ sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong scre@@ am and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z stated . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while suffering from asylum seek@@ ers may present a motion for psych@@ otherapy , psychological sick and asylum seek@@ ers may present a motion for psych@@ otherapy , however , processing takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , social worker or doctors , who are not trained in the social conditions , would not decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ estim@@ ations , &quot; says Mun@@ z . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ wes Robert Mug@@ abe holds false speech in the parliament
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , African leaders , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the case of the case spread rapidly to social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the alleg@@ ations made by members of the opposition , that they have received anonymous death threats and warned them before calling Mr Mug@@ abe to Bu@@ hr@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had war@@ ted him and dis@@ continued during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition polit@@ ician SMS messages have received on their mobile phones that warned them to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es Ad@@ dress .
&quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but she said &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists after Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the affected Parliament members also warns that the immun@@ ity is ending in parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , the parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
chief speaker said that by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; by the dangers of the politicians .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will increase up to 30,000 work@@ places &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to add 25,000 to 30,000 work@@ places within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; in this year , HP will split into two stock companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected loss reduction leads to a load of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these re@@ structured measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable and more sustainable building structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who is expected to divide the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes smaller and more focused than it today is , and we have a broad and intensi@@ fied portfolio of shops that support companies at the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better prepared than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion , and is to be fore@@ seen in providing integrated technology solutions for companies so far as an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it is a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University , Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , called the Silicon Valley &quot; birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has penet@@ rated a massive re@@ structure to tackle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; powered by HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US high @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that cr@@ amped companies will provide better performance . &quot;
Arsenal &apos;s captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates from the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ized to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was not until September , unless his rehabilitation after plan is , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimi@@ stic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and , in view of its history , its participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ ling@@ ers lost the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then back to its old swing during the pre@@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury not threatened the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , that wasn &apos;t good . &quot;
this is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it did not stand in connection with his kn@@ uck@@ les , or with the injuries he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
&quot; he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als , as 157 f@@ asp@@ als in the last five play@@ times . &quot;
&quot; the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League &apos;s clubs that have most vulnerable days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the po@@ aching intensity will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an infr@@ in@@ gement , you have an an@@ ted period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win mar@@ tial power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to conquer it .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will have a career in the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal starts its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea in Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger is presenting yourself within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will be able to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud rather than Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; while Arsenal are clear , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most important in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effects in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o has been un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season has been launched . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , where the Richter scale was 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had moved the lesson from last season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco , driven away from distant hope to lead the association to its first European co @-@ triumph . &quot;
&quot; this impulse is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand , I am long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship festival : the com@@ edy show that give us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open itself , now even more desper@@ ate than ever has become , as self @-@ mor@@ ates among young men on a 15 @-@ year test@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there remains three times more frequently in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ries ( CA@@ LM ) announced the campaign against a p@@ iti@@ ful life in 2015 than the year of man to ask the men to ask for help to seek help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart piece in combat to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with major depres@@ sive symptoms realized that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of enjoyment doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends will reduce the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; however , of course you need to have friends who can work for friendship . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more social media communication , with its focus on style via substance , the in@@ fertility of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to be strong , strong , vital and successful to appear , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by the dominated of what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , all at costs in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our internal year@@ ning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
Schön@@ e with friends was that these focus was on the head .
&quot; every character was defined not by his work , but defined by his personality , defined by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents at the football team in cozy arm@@ chairs and the nostal@@ gia of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can refer to any case even if they often keep themselves back , fully their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a employee of telephone past@@ oral care , it explained to me : ... &quot; my listen@@ er role for people who are de@@ pressed and confident , has really showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends do make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; I come with it quite &quot; has an enormous effect , like feeling that it is perc@@ ei@@ vable in weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows , who comes to me when I try to in@@ corporate long @-@ term mechanical mechanisms . &quot;
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective external status @-@ status via the telephone to the human being in moments of desp@@ air also may help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit this weekend the com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ feast with which to commemor@@ ate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you can see someone alone around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
your friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the full 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; Maria meets the way to P@@ PS@@ G , Malmö . &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani after his hits on Malmö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , PS@@ G helps to pass on Malmö . &quot;
here are the Game Report and the response to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and Edinburgh this day , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain gave his Champions League championship with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prince &apos;s park@@ on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Maria arrived in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the path , but afterwards , they missed a number of opportunities to finally increased their head when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and S@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes Paris a strong start against the Swedish master , since they stri@@ ve not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ -@@ Round , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics missed opportunities in front of the gate . he became later in the game against his home @-@ home team and against the club , with whom he began to illustr@@ ate his illustr@@ ative career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents could cause problems and relax back , even though there are certain things we have to perfect in the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; that is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , even though I regret it that we haven &apos;t even achieved one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after its injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team for the weekend that a 2 : 2 Draw out on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was stolen by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
the Argent@@ inian wing sail@@ er was known as the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he went in to Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö def@@ ences before he passed away from Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network .
&quot; however , somebody believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off hit , in order to attain this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alities on the field and was a big opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ ils P@@ fo@@ s in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G applied themselves sometimes , with some mis@@ ses and bad offspring , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was first pat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had started it after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he had a lot more skill , when he brought his players to the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic to transform the Di Maria into a revol@@ ving that was fle@@ cted by Wil@@ de in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ urs ... &quot;
&quot; the second goal finally fell shortly after the h @-@ hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his six season open@@ er , after which had f@@ aked on a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; all remember that Malmö in the game could go back to the game , and only an excellent procedure of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the end result earlier , before substit@@ utes E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi receive a goal at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave up the fact that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented her change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has since summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; just a few years ago , FC Bayern appeared shortly before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for the FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times Champions League winner , twice champion champion , twice champion , a time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi expects that he was standing before the F@@ EM 2008 before the podium . &quot;
I told me Bar@@ ça to sell me .
&quot; Madrid was back at that time , we did nothing . &quot;
and the registered of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; something I wanted to have . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays various films in the film .
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said , &quot; &quot; she will not need behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a succession of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when they emphas@@ ised the necessity of alternative perspectives and , in regard to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the project &apos;s selected revol@@ ting book . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do you do it during the cast of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
brown re@@ acted to the sho@@ cked un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . &quot; okay . &quot; as the comments of acting from The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown found Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck &apos;s products and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to stri@@ ve to think about it - whoever will always be the director , how to handle the character of the Harmony , Brown said first . &quot;
the only black female and it is a sp@@ it that is defeated by its white p@@ im@@ p .
&quot; the producer of Dear White People , nominated for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio for the director &apos;s rights in the movie ; Dam@@ on said that her direction &quot; could give us something that we do not want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was shown , social media explo@@ ded in front of de@@ comp@@ elling over Dam@@ on comments . &quot;
Twitter users Mr Po@@ et pressed his anger via the clip as he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NEW that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et served over 5,000 retin@@ ets and 4,000 liqu@@ or since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on comments are coming at a point in the exact ra@@ vis@@ ical representation in the media at the head of the social debate .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide impact on the legisl@@ ature and authorities , discri@@ min@@ ating practices against color @-@ areas . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince began an embar@@ rass@@ ment on the movement during the introduction of nominated records of the Year at the Grammy Awards . &quot;
&quot; album still quite a matter , ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums will still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leader of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation as a reaction to the question of Fox News @-@ Person@@ ality Elizabeth Hass@@ el@@ beck the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently she was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;

&quot; for the last task , climbing an 75 ft long climbing rope was in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , Wher@@ eu@@ pon it was the first Ath@@ let who finished the demanding phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished these challenge full three seconds faster than winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Great Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap . &quot;
so very suddenly .. I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final , and why Brit@@ ten , even though he finished the title at all , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
according to rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , one receives the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much the money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s swe@@ pt over it .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he has done .
crowds of awards won &apos;t get from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
&quot; and I think , Isaac would have felt as much as having played the roles . &quot;
America Ninja Warrior became extended for a season ; fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ aks along Minnesota &apos;s T@@ wins
mint original L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball . today , the tiger stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfect for the Minnesota &apos;s T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 at the target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins agreed a chance for ascent in the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; for Detroit , although only for a night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so hard to deal with a great part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; Tig@@ ers managers Brad spin . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scores three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth , and then once in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times to 1 / 3 inside and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ do@@ pen every game , and therefore I will completely go into the game . &quot;
&quot; the newly designed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has sha@@ ken the impact well , &quot; &quot; said cre@@ denti@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better from the bull@@ do@@ zers , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three ranks in the rear @-@ meeting at the end of the seventh interior , T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to play again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left line line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful one and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to be a Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left hand Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy survived wall , the only man confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with the newly @-@ called Rook@@ ie b@@ ats@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , who left a two @-@ run mate Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runner and the final run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play . &quot;
it was the major league leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ling hit a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth step , wall included a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser Bruce Ron@@ don and scored a 5 @-@ 4 level . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed sp@@ ass is S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth wave . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ ited for the opening of the game by an even mobile Phil Hughes .
&quot; the tig@@ ers came three ranks in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed player veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the po@@ aching list , after having been missing more than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I would have wished me , &quot; said Hughes , &quot; but I felt wo@@ ve when I was rele@@ asing and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after winning the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ER gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led to the game with Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the track in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , succeeded in another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers were in the second , achieved one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor said . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat particularly well , but caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hughes was in a number of Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ ated right @-@ handed pin A.@@ J.@@ A@@ zer . &quot;
Hughes made it three ranks with six hits and a walk with four kn@@ outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sán@@ chez was eliminated in violation of the lim@@ b .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who re@@ acted the one from Sanchez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the level of injuries due to a shoulder ke@@ w , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with Sanchez out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the level of injuries to win the T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since it was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th . &quot;
he has been wr@@ inkl@@ ed since 20 August with a dist@@ ortion in the right thigh .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 to 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees to under@@ go in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
&quot; the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that this definite re@@ thinking about military action options may not be held without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective direction . &quot;
four years ago it was glad that the cup of a military participation in Germany has gone .
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; he said in the Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the earlier German ambassador in Washington called for a massive rise of international aid to the refugees . &quot;
Austria controls in southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday night , the Austrian Minister of Internal Affairs , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared no one to Hungary on Tuesday night . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there were no refugees to be sent back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , this has been agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said it had already been signed between the General Director General of Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
&quot; as a concrete figures , she did not refer to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in the last days , tens of thousands of refugees tops the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
their destination is usually Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , submitted a special summit for next week . &quot;
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not yet to agree on a joint procedure in the crisis .
the EU ministers will want to take a new attempt to make a binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee post in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries with the initial intake and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the agreement to manage it along with the countries , announced on Tuesday night to almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ carriage , those people who need protection , yiel@@ ding this too . &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye view it could not remain in Germany .
this conception was agreed in the round in the turn .
&quot; the German Chancellor emphas@@ ised , the state as a whole needs to cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees have been stuck in the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , including the border to Romania and a fence . &quot;
this neighbour &apos;s land belongs to the EU as a part of Serbia .
&quot; Hungary may prevent the h@@ ug@@ ly search for Romania over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to to the planned new boundary . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan to promp@@ tly .
there were first ar@@ rests of people running through the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , because eye @-@ witnesses reported thousands of migrants on the way to the Greek border . &quot;

these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the moon is easily on its orbit around the Ring Road . &quot;
&quot; this bar@@ ge movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a continuous cel@@ est@@ ial body , it says in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers have presenting their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;

&quot; at least at the South Pole , the astronom@@ ers had to be surrounded . &quot;
however the extent of the hidden ocean was not explained .

&quot; according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis is expected to break out four weeks . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult for us , Rama is a her@@ man loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we must re@@ think now , &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ sk@@ n the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a harmon@@ ious pros . &quot;

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
&quot; however , who wants to pay on its slim figure , it is often de@@ pl@@ eted by them . &quot;
because man@@ gan@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruit are still healthy : in these , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. mainly include man@@ gan@@ os but much vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ car@@ otene . &quot;
&quot; whoever eats the fruits , thus supports se@@ er , immune system , and met@@ abolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gan@@ os should not be too soft or too strong and smell in pleasant smell . &quot;
the form@@ work color alone says nothing about how mature fruit is - so green man@@ gan@@ os also can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within less days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ goes , however , are also a special note . &quot;

&quot; as met@@ e@@ o@@ News is written in a message , Switzerland is currently on the fore@@ front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure reserve across the British Islands in a powerful Sou@@ thwest . &quot;
&quot; at the Alpine side , the night will break through the valleys in the night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the hair @-@ dryer until Thursday morning starts in the gro@@ ans with bows from 60 to 100 km / h , partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there are now a Martin Luther square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in presence of Municip@@ ality Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park was christ@@ ened on the Opp@@ io hills on the name of the German Re@@ forms . &quot;
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ h@@ o &quot; he is now credited as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
&quot; the park is right in the heart of Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot;
the name was then requested by the Protestant churches of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Protestant Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that protests in the town of the Pop@@ es through centuries as a minority often could live in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; by the way , in a symbolic way , I become view@@ able that the tradition of Christian faith is in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed on a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
&quot; back then , he emp@@ tied the city as a bl@@ out@@ dated sin @-@ label . &quot;
his negative impressions will be em@@ bol@@ dened by Rome in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then led his thes@@ es in the western church in his thes@@ es with his thes@@ es .
hammer artist spent three years in the interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that led by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and published a Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with magnificent pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his personal interpretation of Bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful paints and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by far it equ@@ alled by &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , the subject can be adjusted quite well . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , such as cross two , pl@@ agues , commandments , or dre@@ ad will be created . &quot;
&quot; thus , he spont@@ aneously fascin@@ ates multiple partners : this is true for Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has focused on painting with the respective no@@ vels . &quot;
he interpreted the Bible studies by Ot@@ mar Old Bible and into current connections .
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; in embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist , they form@@ ulated his personal thoughts on their respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has gold letters .
&quot; like the 75 year old , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old now allows for a deep insight into his soul , its emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were finally a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 , born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who heard the strict protest@@ ant political Order . &quot;
&quot; so the up@@ bringing took place already with the cane &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt remembers . &quot;
&quot; I tried to stop the work , in order to im@@ itate me again with the Lord Jesus . &quot;
his second aim is to re@@ prove art in the time to more place : &quot; the perception of image cos@@ mopolit@@ an is influenced by advertisement today and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being margin@@ alized .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures are always mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar : I would like to let the viewer in &quot; &quot; hin@@ ts &quot; &quot; look at them , discover and sense them that might have them : &quot; the image will seek his counter@@ attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stressed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , &quot; already always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like what he understands with his images . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t let the Bible be respected , who understand the Bible completely , but also selected mystery issues for him . &quot;
&quot; that was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the images , the text explained only . &quot; it was written to be a pictures of images . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ hl@@ ist from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; to deep@@ en his life and to freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
&quot; part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation . &quot;
construction work for BM@@ X track na@@ d

&quot; the conf@@ is@@ ations in politics and administration appointed for ad@@ ren@@ al , especially among the residents , which did not toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so , hill deported to new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will come in October , the first joint @-@ to @-@ date with Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ah @-@ Bock from now on to inform young and youth affairs . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year has something more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should be started without &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; with works at the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to 2019 , and the Bundesliga last weekend will make a clear sign . &quot;
the football responded to a growing location in Germany and sec@@ ures policy his help with managing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I have been the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interested in particular to get this subject to the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel held on 23 September in Berlin , he inten@@ sively discuss the situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet the Minister for State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the theme will surely play a pi@@ vot@@ al role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs have to place the policy .
&quot; therefore , the German football covenant , therefore , has expanded its refugee policy &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues to run until 2019 , &quot; stated K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA session in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
&quot; also , some federal gi@@ sts assist this program . &quot;
&quot; this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ts are setting a clear sign if they are taking place on the left tri@@ cot kern@@ els ( Hermes ) to the &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ propriet@@ or Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler visited &quot; &quot; Picture &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every way , no one may see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football citizenship , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , influence and our possibilities to help many refugees that have ever been so incredibly suffered to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig has spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
&quot; for the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license companies have started in their own projects , be great . &quot;
&quot; just as great , small and smallest associations are active there . &quot;
&quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; Welcome , &quot; which we have spent will live in the football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , the association is together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government will each provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; clubs have already proclaimed the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;

&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the sum@@ mer@@ time he had no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everybody can happen . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stop again , if you please . &quot;
McLaren @-@ spare pilot Magn@@ ussen only skir@@ m@@ ish ...
Magn@@ ussen t@@ wit@@ ched a photograph and stated that he suffered from the wheel when he had suffered from the wheel .
he is therefore just as little as the reserve for the two tri@@ bal people Fernando Alonso and J@@ enson Button demand this weekend in Singapore last week .
&quot; football : Bv@@ B , without Re@@ us v. Kras@@ no@@ dar , Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Gate &quot;
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes fixed to a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of Europe in the first group of Europe .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the football league in Du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t return to him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach will be open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ ops will not only change its root position at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ epers .
therefore Roman go@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking a place of art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the World Teacher qualified the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in future in all Europe @-@ League games , Hol@@ ly left them open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also dispute the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ warding statement of Mit@@ us Re@@ us , that the fin@@ alist suit was to be the goal for the B@@ V@@ B in the European League , holding mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ n for a re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able@@ table : &quot; it does not lie so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Rob@@ otic cars : government plans to lead pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be technological adv@@ ances in technological adv@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday at the edge of the Frankfurt Motor Show at a &quot; New Mobility Age . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated , connected driving will increase the traffic safety and ensure less st@@ icking , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also plans to discuss the topic with his counter@@ parts from the G7 countries , which also coinci@@ de with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show . &quot;
the strategic paper of the Federal Ministry emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a generous retreat on digital radio stations .
&quot; for testing new technique , a test distance on Highway 9 was produced in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the driver &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; verify the legal framework conditions , &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany is going to use an international target that the maximum permissible speed of self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the federal government will also apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in autom@@ ating driving , the car gets the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment , process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , non @-@ free vehicles on public roads are to be expected to be far from 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features at location Germany appreci@@ ates the study by 2025 , at around 8.4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the SPD &apos;s digital networking may lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l SPD barrier . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; an investigation on the AA pen@@ ultimate survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the DE@@ K@@ RA , based on the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be en@@ forced in the next ten years , and 32 percent do not believe anything at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States have 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; based on a digital @-@ pass data collection , only seven percent would agree to give control over the whole journey across all high@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; at the free@@ way , the highway could imagine 15 per cent on the highway , in stag@@ nation 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , each Fourth would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to current status , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to fight for the cont@@ enders from 25 September to 4 October only in the single . &quot;
the final decision should be taken until September 22 at the latest .
&quot; that is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title with Timo &apos;s title , &quot; said federal coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM &apos;s teaching in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed Spon@@ sor@@ ption in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the dis@@ advantage , we are now no more so clear un@@ think@@ able , &quot; declared single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j O@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who performs the S@@ etz@@ ler List in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also recall the Euro 2013 in Schwe@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo too saw , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; the World R@@ ank@@ ings declared . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a juni@@ per @-@ go@@ wns note : the designer Jean Paul G@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that make it terri@@ fying thanks to vide@@ opro@@ jec@@ tions .
&quot; they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and there@@ with that he was in the skirts . &quot;
I can &apos;t say today that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant of hau@@ te Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair .
&quot; it was so easy , in the meantime it is real , &quot; said G@@ aul . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed its initially dis@@ sent@@ ing attitude towards a show . &quot;
&quot; he was actually opposed to it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition felt a little bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
it is tolerance and acceptance and the vision of an open society .
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s history , which has written fashion history , without having ever completed an apprentices@@ hip as ever . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total of plastic works for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ying the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist has been hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ators , according to the Cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , according to Munich , cre@@ ators have with@@ ered 14 tons of material . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest was another highlight : a leather out@@ fit out@@ fit with cork .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , he said . &quot;
G@@ aul &apos;s old ted@@ dy is also seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , delicate fashionable stran@@ ds of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student or bad in football ) he attracted a ted@@ dy B@@ HS and dress , he said : &quot;
&quot; with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
the dis@@ miss@@ al of fashion he brought himself up later on .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as G@@ aul in Munich . &quot;
later I bought it later .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he could not pay the models . &quot;
they didn &apos;t get anything but they were able to keep the clothes .
Je@@ wels instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ anned tip as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; early in the past , we had the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around plans to do so . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in large amounts for customers , for example , covering blank@@ ets and gar@@ den@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; today , the company is not working anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the Mo@@ stly pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the early schedule of the pla@@ ited tip , fashion has played a bigger role , was then pushed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt lists some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which is aimed at le@@ aning on the past , is an increasing client potential . &quot;
&quot; no longer being served in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available on the market . &quot;
they already make half of all orders already .
E@@ quest@@ ing Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association of Pl@@ au@@ lin tip and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they may wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , approximately 80 percent of sales were taken away . &quot;
there are almost no more specialized stores and retail stores .
our products will hardly be able to achieve our products on this path .
the mass ware in the Asian region become much cheaper nowadays and almost exclusively sold through chains .
&quot; it is also weaker , current to Russia and in the United States . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new routes .
&quot; the industry association seeks to score points even through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been producing a seal of quality that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger outlet of the West@@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ dery and tips .
&quot; to achieve this competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; there is an area of excitement among the magical ideas of designers and companies that need to think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often varies just slightly , to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical snow @-@ pointed tip . &quot;
the machine sm@@ others small ch@@ icks to some places .
&quot; the plan for the &quot; &quot; Gold@@ smith &quot; &quot; of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach K@@ rau@@ lt left it : &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t start with traditional plans . &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a elabor@@ ate procedure , they shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of ple@@ a - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies in the USA , Australia , and Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors were living in plans and surroundings , and those who want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ lin tip . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ Film
&quot; legend should not touch it , but Disney adds it to a new movie &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not about a new film , but in order to be a continuation of 20 years after the first film with the magic pedi@@ atri@@ cian . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny &apos;s family in times of the world &apos;s economic crisis in England .

XI is pushing ahead to open the economy broad for the world
&quot; the economy must open bro@@ ader towards the outside , in order to fo@@ ster growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was in charge of a group &apos;s steering system . &quot;
&quot; China should aim to attract international investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business activities , &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; developing new start @-@ ups and promote reforms in advance , raising new moment@@ um and vitality and offer a new place for economic growth , X@@ i said . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity list to control the market access , recreation of the border controls policies , promotion of government farms ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants -@@ Mel@@ des@@ oft . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified , which will not come into question . &quot;
&quot; the system is tested , tested and tested by test programs . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is of importance since it provides a greater role in the market , providing a legally binding business environment , and the submitted would be submitted to the market . &quot;
&quot; the government will also ease inspec@@ tions about the powers transmitted to the company , and make sure that businesses do their business . &quot;
&quot; the statement also said that China Will permit border fields to explore new models of cross @-@ border public , operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of an offer , open @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas will open for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the righ@@ t@@ ful interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and bring better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners , to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by reducing the requirements and the application process will be reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; their lawyers have the right to ensure their work , and using professional judges and attor@@ neys , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;

EU wants to double the mercury @-@ border in rob@@ ber@@ fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors , and consumers this with a significantly higher dose of stroke . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who pre@@ ten@@ ds a particular business paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans to critic@@ ise : &quot; risks and side effects contra@@ sted for industrial and environmental policy , &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have increased the limits of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish . &quot;
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are still heavily bur@@ dened as mercury in fact that only 50 percent of the remaining stock levels must not be sold .
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be fail@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in exchange for this sl@@ ack@@ ening , the EU wants to merge the limit values with other fish , from currently 0.5 mg to 0,1 mg of mercury per kilogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller peac@@ o@@ fish , like car@@ p usually bur@@ dened as low they are already holding the projected maximum value today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of the g@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ li@@ ding di@@ stra@@ ction , that helps the economy alone , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mercury is a high @-@ level heavy metal which amounts to the food chain particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; small amounts have already been affected especially in new@@ bor@@ ns of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry announced its homepage with regard to the applicable high levels , however , that a &quot; health risk of the general population &quot; was not expected . &quot;
mercury is primarily attributable to coal combustion into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information provided by the Federal Environment Agency , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ ck ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of Germany produced in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in Alsace , Rhine and Danube is permanently sur@@ passed and nationwide , &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , European war@@ nings against mercury in fish already reported to the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot;
