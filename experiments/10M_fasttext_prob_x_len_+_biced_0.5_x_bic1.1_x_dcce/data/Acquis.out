&quot; because of the repeti@@ tive ref@@ usal of the community , the naming of inspec@@ tors in the organisation , the Council of the Organization shall be hin@@ dered with the aim of the executive director , following the Executive Vice @-@ General of the Organization - in the following as &quot; the Executive Vice @-@ General , &quot; with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The Community and the states concerned are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors are actually able to provide them according to their agreements , according to their conventions . &quot;
&quot; ( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors , will be set up so that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disorder for the community and the states and for the inspection of the peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ; &quot;
II ) to ensure the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization to know @-@ how confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each state is opposed to the organization , including its assets , means and assets , as well as their inspec@@ tors , and other officials to comply with the provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; security measures after this Convention will end with regard to nuclear material when the community and the organisation determine that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is used for nuclear activity , which is under consideration of the security measures of Bel@@ ang , is no longer usable or practically non @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; the Community has been quoted , according to the organisation according to this Convention , the transfer of core material from the states which is subject to securing the security measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; security measures after this Convention are concluded with regard to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as in this agreement , has taken over responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organization introduces documentation , from which any transmission and if necessary , the re @-@ application of backup measures on the given core material goes forth . &quot;
&quot; should Nu@@ clear material , security measures after this Convention , is subject to non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacturing of allo@@ ys or ceramics , thus agreed to the community with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the backup measures can be completed according to this material in regard to this material . &quot;
&quot; II ) that the candle material is used during the duration of non @-@ use of the security measures after this Convention , which is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; B ) The organisation and community meet in detail that the security measures envisaged in this Convention shall not be applied for such a long time , when the core material is used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , and under what circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will once again be applied once again , once the core material is led again to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organisation is maintained over the total quantity , and the composition of this material in the respective state or in the concerned states , and on any distribution of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to affairs , such as in other time @-@ time and procedur@@ al regulations and procedures for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement , or an anti @-@ security policy knowledge of the military activity , and does not refer to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states carry out the costs involved in each of them to carry out their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or persons who are governed by their territory , however an extraordinary cost as a result of a special experience of the organization , thus reimbur@@ se the organisation that costs , unless they agreed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization has the cost of all additional measurements and sampling , which are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and states ensure that the liability of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used for the organization and for the purpose of implementing this Convention in the same way as the nationality of the states . &quot;
any claim to establish the community or a state against the organization or a state against the community or a state against the community or a state against damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear inter@@ rup@@ tedly - it claims arising from the implementation of security measures after this Convention is regulated in accordance with international law .
&quot; the Council after verification of the fac@@ tual information presented by the Executive Vice @-@ General , that the organization has not been able to rep@@ lic@@ ated by post @-@ examination , that no nuclear material must be violated , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear war@@ ms , so he may take the reports intended in Article XII paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and may take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council should take into account the advice of applied security measures , and the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties has been affected - any reasonable opportunity to provide the advice the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consultations on issues that arise from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and states are entitled to seek , therefore questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention , be tested by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the state to participate in discussing such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any disputes expressed by the Council of Article 19 or another by the Council , there are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation way or by another by the organization , the community and the states , to submit to a refer@@ ral Tribunal relating to an arbitr@@ ator , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also desig@@ nat@@ es two arbitr@@ ators , and the four so called arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth , which he pres@@ iding . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states , or the organization of three days after the request for a refer@@ ee cannot be named according to two arbitr@@ ators , so the community or organisation can seek the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these refer@@ ee . &quot;
the same procedure is to apply if bin@@ ars three days after the designation or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator of the fifth arbit@@ ers have not yet been elected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of the members of the arbitration courts must be invited , and all decisions must be made by at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic via trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ o
&quot; I honour the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the use of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the fellowship with respect . during these negotiations the two parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; in the context of this agreement the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure appropriate procedures that the actual amount of the annual amount did not over@@ pass and executed in accordance with the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form due to changes in technology and trading will be possible , so consult the two parties of this agreement with each other prior to the introduction of such a change within the number of 10 mentioned committees to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection clause in claim , it is obliged to bear the concern that this agreement is not touched by Argentina &apos;s accession to the common market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the pil@@ es made from Argentina into one year exceeded the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end the fet@@ us from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit our exhaus@@ tion from all of this agreement to a testi@@ cles of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em to limit .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community has been changing with Argentina the number 2 set amounts according to the extent of the Argent@@ inian trade with any new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the licensing agreements for these new Member States are determined according to the provisions of Acc@@ ession contract ; this is borne , under the number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz on the invoice . &quot;
&quot; the total amount of the total amount will be set to the community on 23 000 tons of battle weight , with the day of the accession of Greece . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development which could interfere with the marketing of Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ b@@ arians at the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community takes precautions to viol@@ ate the paragraph of interven@@ tion@@ ists on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ b@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the goals and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that every actual application of equipment or other funding measures for the export of har@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs , as well as for the cont@@ emp@@ t of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , in accordance with the existing international obligations , are in accordance with the existing international commitments in accordance with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way out which is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal inch and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular that it granted the quantities of export licenses specified in this agreement for the number 1 mentioned products within this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community is committed to meeting all necessary precautions , to ensure the distribution of disposable licenses for the aforementioned products based in Argentina from the presentation of an export licence , which is issued in the office by the Argent@@ in@@ ean government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system will be defined so that on the status of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be avoided .
&quot; in terms of implementation , it is also determined that the responsible Argent@@ in@@ ean authority of the competent authority of the community has been granted in regular intervals to en@@ code the export licenses ; these details are to en@@ code after identification . &quot;
the committee carries out that the agreement will be properly applied and run smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat &apos;s car@@ nal market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions that are of importance to the number 7 mentioned above . &quot;
&quot; the Committee bears no concern that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb - and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out according to the collective numbers of numbers according to the community . &quot;
the committee deb@@ ds all questions regarding the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the appropriate regulatory authorities .
the provisions of this agreement are un@@ har@@ med the rights and obligations of the parties under the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount of the annual amount is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 .
&quot; the amount entered into force from the entry into force up to 1 January of the following year will be set in proportion to the total annual amount , and contributes to the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to terminate it with a notice period of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be checked by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that it should be understandable . &quot;

&quot; the quantity in a container must be so big , that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the produc@@ tion@@ ate has over all production levels and controls the re@@ agents to lead to blood@@ group@@ ing written records .
reasonable samples of all re@@ agents are to be kept as long by laboratory san@@ atorium until some probability can be accepted that the batch is no longer used .
&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood re@@ agents may contain substances of human , animal , botan@@ icals ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary means to enhance the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agents . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective use in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents do not contain substances of human origin . &quot;
