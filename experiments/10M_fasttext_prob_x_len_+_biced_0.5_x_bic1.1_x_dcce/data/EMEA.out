this document is a summary of the European Public Relations Committee ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which clari@@ fies the studies carried out by the Committee on Human Physi@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) to get recommendations on the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the packages ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tab@@ letten ( tablets that dissolve itself in the mouth ) , as a solution to the entry ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , mis@@ trust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental illness , in which the patient can have some normal episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe general episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to the inclusion or mel@@ ting tab@@ letten can be applied in patients where the lo@@ cks of tablets are difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines , which are just like Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; i.e. chemical substances , which allow communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters affect the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in with schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing it . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the re @-@ act of symptoms to prevent , was investigated in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution has been compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in increased unrest , compared to a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was tested over twelve weeks on 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ oper@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo that have been stabil@@ ised to 160 patients , in which the Ottoman symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy were compared . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which l@@ apped to increased unrest , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the variation of the symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients employed on the treatment of patients . &quot;
&quot; the company also conducted trials in order to examine how the body uses the mel@@ ting tab@@ letten , and the solution to the intru@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients that received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased than the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; when applying the bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ time studies . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re @-@ occur Man@@ ical episodes in previously treated patients , and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ tic disrup@@ tions ( inf@@ om@@ men@@ ities ) , vom@@ iting , nausea and exhaus@@ tion ( increased memory production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Imp@@ act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and from moderate to heavy episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the Ottoman episodes spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with Ottoman episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if a or@@ ale therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
June 2004 divided the European Commission to the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is prescribed for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
increased effectiveness on doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is reset from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ icide behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that there was no increase in patients with bi@@ polar disorder than with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ colour or isch@@ a@@ emia diseases , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ cutting medicines ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ie ( including acoustic and mal@@ ign@@ ite form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical studies , one year or less persistent , there were occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l asc@@ ending Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if in a case with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ur@@ dy@@ sp@@ ines@@ ia occur , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that points to a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , must be eliminated all anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ans in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , or with states that are associated with var@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , an increased ster@@ oids compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study involving fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for unwanted cerebral rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related undes@@ irable events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients , the direct comparisons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ es , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , where weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nerve system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with an over@@ bearing side effects as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ is Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the remains of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , whereby this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study involving healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces increased a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the Au@@ c of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made . &quot;
&quot; at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans , the common application can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible Met@@ abol@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should predomin@@ ate the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions . &quot;
&quot; after the crash of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage should be raised from AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the D@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y before the onset of the companion therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ am concentrations .
in clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l a day with no significant effect on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of sub@@ str@@ ates by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ane to / 3 @-@ methodology morph@@ in@@ an @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ me@@ z@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal studies , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned of hazardous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the below side effects is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long term study over 52 weeks occurred among patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) from EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ak@@ ath@@ ic , d@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ie compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ oper@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z therapy . &quot;
man@@ ian episodes with Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks amounted to the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ am treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ il@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS amounted to 18 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ am treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , with which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely @-@ controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ atin @-@ phosph@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients , compared to 2.6 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and over their occurrence also associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , include the mal@@ ign@@ ne neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ur@@ dy@@ sp@@ ines and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
in clinical studies and since the market launch were un@@ intended or inten@@ tional persu@@ asi@@ tism with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of a tick @-@ analysis with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plas@@ map@@ le . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to the alpha @-@ 1 ep@@ in@@ ep@@ ts and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
&quot; with Gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy pro@@ ban@@ den showed the Pos@@ it@@ om@@ et@@ ons E@@ missions @-@ Tom@@ ography a dos@@ is@@ cop@@ ed reduction of the bond of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ ative . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant increase in psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ il@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of the Res@@ p@@ onder patients , who were talking to study medicine in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from meas@@ ur@@ als , which were defined as secondary students , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ uph@@ old scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ oper@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks on stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was on 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and in 57 % on placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ c in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schizophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; was , came under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of the valuable patient ) weight ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to placebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ ards and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bee @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a compared to placebo over a week 3 and a survey effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ operated dol in Week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also proved in week 12 a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia on like lithium or Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits that include partial therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a superior effect in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long@@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who reached with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole over 74 weeks before Rand@@ om@@ isation had achieved a re@@ mission in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar relap@@ se , predominantly in preventing a relap@@ se . &quot;

&quot; with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmaceutical ine@@ tics between male and female healthy proportions , as well as demonstrated by a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schizophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
an e @-@ specific evaluation of Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy pro@@ gangs .
&quot; a single dose study at trial with various liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function to the phar@@ mac@@ rop@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to pull conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security concerns , toxicity in repeated gift , reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ o@@ genic potential left the pre@@ clinical data no special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only at doses or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of my@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , at the 4@@ 60 women participating in metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously obtained a anth@@ rac@@ er . &quot;
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in omni@@ present or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 treated with my@@ x@@ ane @-@ treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs . &quot;
&quot; if one regards only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference in relation to the deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs . &quot;
it may also not be applied to patients who are silent or before starting the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ onic numbers in the blood .
&quot; the Committee on Human Physi@@ otherapy ( CH@@ MP ) was fixed , that the first treatment was no longer propos@@ ing to be more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs and that it has to be given unlike other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs not with other medicines to decrease side @-@ effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission distributed the MP Bio@@ Science Limited filed a permit for the transport of my@@ x@@ ane in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
my@@ stic mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and is not shown for a default anth@@ rac@@ ist therapy ( see also section 4.@@ 4 ) .

&quot; when sensory N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 is the treatment to break down , until a reduction to degree 1 or 2 is achieved , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there have been no studies carried out with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with draw@@ backs of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .

&quot; in a study 43 patients were treated with metastatic breast cancer with my@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
this multi @-@ centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the form of soluble Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of my@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without preced@@ ent ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised public condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;

&quot; this means that se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( &quot; &quot; Re@@ ference Ag@@ ents &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood trans@@ fusion , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the surgery is not possible and in which a blood@@ stream of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown .
&quot; in case of patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a personal bleeding , it is inj@@ ected to be inj@@ ected in a V@@ ene . &quot;
the injection can also be made by the patient or its supervis@@ ors if they have received proper guidance .
&quot; patients with chronic kidney failure and patients who receive chemotherapy should always be recommended in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ age in adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l with children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are treated before treatment , to ensure that no iron lack is made , and iron supple@@ mentary should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive an chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ ine or thereby , that the body is not sufficient on the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used primarily to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which they ordered to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed was compared with administration as injection as an injection in a major study with 4@@ 79 patients , which caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks prior to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o before they had either received se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
major Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the hem@@ ost@@ ins values between the beginning of the study and the post@@ age period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company also examined the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin were f@@ aded se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients , who received an chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ al values of patients were maintained in the same measure , as for those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

8 For patients with chronic kidney failure should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended cap of the h@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target con@@ centric .
clinical studies have been observed an increased murder risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events when Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) with a hem@@ ost@@ al - target con@@ centric of over 12 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were given .
controlled clinical studies have shown any significant benefits that is attributable to the Gift of epo@@ et@@ ine when the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ ds can be raised by the concentration of ass@@ ures and the avoidance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required .
the hem@@ ost@@ rop@@ bin@@ an@@ rose should be approximately 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in case of patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ al her@@ edi@@ tary disease or storage in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended cap of the h@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target con@@ centric .
&quot; according to this findings , findings is due to the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
in tumor chemotherapy among chemotherapy should be taken into account for assessing the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ offering and the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be transm@@ itter ) .
if the H@@ B increase is greater than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / d@@ l ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ a @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ ost@@ bell value between 10 g / d@@ l and 12 g / d@@ l ) .
&quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ etine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment under the patient &apos;s participation , which should also consider the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater electri@@ cian procedure , if possible , prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy the cause of an@@ emia are examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater el@@ ective orthop@@ edic surgery should have an adequate risk for thro@@ mbo@@ genic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially for underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of care of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk for post@@ operative thro@@ ws / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ chs has not been proven to improve the overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or decrease the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received an chemotherapy was brought back when a hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in target con@@ centric between 12 - 14 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in controls and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ind@@ osis will be adjusted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it . &quot;
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of tum@@ ours there is no evidence of a interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F for hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
&quot; about thro@@ ws , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ di@@ al in@@ dem@@ ics , m@@ yo@@ car@@ ess , cerebral hem@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , mos@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood@@ shed in artificial kidneys , was reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ hable increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.@@ 4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ et@@ ins .
independent of the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood@@ stream to thro@@ mbo@@ genic and vas@@ cular complications .
&quot; the GM epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and in relation to the amino acids and of carbohydrates , identical to the endo@@ genous human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ esthe@@ tic patient . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures human bone mar@@ sh cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the er@@ y@@ thropo@@ esis and not influenced the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .

survival and tum@@ ours have been examined in five large @-@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ e@@ ased studies and
in the open study there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid arthritis patients and the patient &apos;s control .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ized Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ ancies , consistent an un@@ resolved , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid arthritis sufferers in patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk for thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tumor tissues , which can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ized an@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clarified , how far these results are addressed to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ized er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ our patients with the aim of reaching a hem@@ ost@@ bell value below 13 g / d@@ l , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the audi@@ ted data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous use showed a half @-@ time of about 4 hours in healthy pro@@ ban@@ den and a slightly prolonged half @-@ time of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections , the ser@@ um level of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um level that is achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no p@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are intended 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone fibro@@ sis is a known compilation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study involving Lyme disease patients , which were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , was the incidence of bone mar@@ inated fibro@@ sis across the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone bur@@ sts ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a little trau@@ matic shell like the hin@@ der ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changed the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip prices should be obtained before the first in@@ fusion a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms included in the three days after in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ p@@ ic symptoms , joints and headaches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta is allowed to be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data base for Zom@@ eta was drawn to the review of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was examined the number of spine and hip measurements over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study comprised of 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , recently reported on a frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures for a period of up to five years . &quot;
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get there was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with R@@ ise@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
&quot; main indic@@ ative for the effectiveness was whether the salary of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates in Ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone sub@@ fabric is re @-@ adjusted ) in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % against the output value . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) has been reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those among placebo the risk of hip implants were reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip prices 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
&quot; most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less common at repeated advertisers . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta must not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ en@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney failure , reactions to the in@@ fusion function and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta makes enligh@@ tening material for doctors ready to prescri@@ be the A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , the indication of how the medicine is to be used , as well as such material for patients with which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging material • contra@@ indication of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , the non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • W@@ ann on medical or nursing help . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently exp@@ ired low @-@ trau@@ matic boun@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with a low @-@ traumati@@ zing hip , the administration of in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended for two or more weeks after the operative supply of the frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should have prescribed A@@ cl@@ asta just by physicians who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long R@@ emission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; additionally it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traumati@@ zing hip , an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 in front or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first A@@ cl@@ asta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by offering Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
patients with kidney disorder ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for these patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and eli@@ ver@@ ability in older patients is similar to younger . &quot;
&quot; children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age , since data is lacking in inf@@ estation and effectiveness . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) not recommended since this patient population is only limited clinical experience .
an existing hypo@@ critical a@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta due to adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ en@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ critical re@@ mia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; additionally it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be assessed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental treatment with appropriate preventive dentistry . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental crowns , no data are available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw@@ n@@ ines . &quot;
clinical assessment by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by offering Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases of pre @-@ hoped for patients , the A@@ cl@@ asta received , increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0,@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of pre @-@ hoped for A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.7 % ) and placebo ( 2.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug interactions are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney disorder Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ en@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which expressed itself as a decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. , an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as an acute kidney failure . &quot;
the modification of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial at oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .

effects on morph@@ ometric spine of A@@ cl@@ asta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new spine surveys ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients aged 75 years and older had a total of 60 % reduced risk of spine architec@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on air@@ frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta took an equal effect over three years , which resulted in a by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip changes . &quot;

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg oni@@ on acid in comparison with intake of 30 mg r@@ ise@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months of comparison studies .
&quot; in the combined results , after 6 months a similar decrease of pain relief and pain kill@@ ings was observed in comparison to raw value for A@@ cl@@ asta and R@@ ise@@ dr@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
patients who were classified as Res@@ p@@ onder at the end of the six month @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) could be included in a after@@ observ@@ able phase .

&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially estrogen , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in rather successive loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is un@@ arranged , which makes the bone is weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alizes the bone structure , making a normal bone formation safer and thus gives the bones once more strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff when you use other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking pharmaceuticals , of which it is known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta , along with food and drinks , you will be worried that you can take enough liquid according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is advised two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hill . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
&quot; because A@@ cl@@ asta appears for a long time , you will possibly need another dose for a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium mirror in your blood will not be too low in the time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can take longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta was missed , Set@@ ting you immediately get in touch with your doctor or hospital in order to make a new date . &quot;
&quot; before termination of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta Falls you are considering the end of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next doctor &apos;s min and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and sp@@ ills , muscle - or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms at yourself after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently been low @-@ traumati@@ zing hip , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the cargo . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who received an di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ en@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ critical re@@ mia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; additionally it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly minimum twice a day 500 mg total amount of calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently been low @-@ traumati@@ zing hip , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 in front of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended . &quot;

&quot; abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Relations Committee ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , in which clari@@ fies the studies carried out by the Committee on Human Physi@@ otherapy ( CH@@ MP ) . &quot;
Ac@@ tos are used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ al medicine ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ al medicine .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can be applied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ onic acid and insulin is maintained , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ onic hard@@ wood and insulin delivery should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body @-@ active insulin can be dil@@ uted in better , and the blood sugar mirror decreases , which makes type @-@ 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; for more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been investigated ; in this case , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ onic resin , in addition , they received either an account or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ zed hem@@ ost@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes the blood sugar intake in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg reduced . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ ph@@ onic acid in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the extra gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study that investig@@ ates the combination of accounts and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who participated in addition to insulin , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % with the patients who were additionally placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ dies@@ thesia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to tyre ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos are used as part of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission distributed the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for approval by Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , curved and wear on one side the mark@@ er &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also displayed for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin , and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to use Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are vulnerable by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose @-@ proof . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ogenic reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oil , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease has been performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , which does not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output of output ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal division ) or with other signs of liver illness may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ Spiegel are increased until the 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ values are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , loss of appetite and / or darker resin , are liver enz@@ ym@@ eric values . &quot;
the decision to continue whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should continue until the pre@@ conditions of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment should be led .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected and in some cases with a liquid waste .
as a result of hem@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one resulted in the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ atom@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ ost@@ ins by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower extent even in patients with sul@@ ph@@ onic hard@@ wood and insulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ ost@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ atom@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitivity in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ onic resin or tri@@ c combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , above an occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic bro@@ u@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients report on distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic assessment should be considered .
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages in@@ desirable events with regard to bone broo@@ ks from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the estimated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with the number of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparison @-@ medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 Fra@@ tures per 100 patient years ) associated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 Fra@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients treated with a comparison @-@ medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment is dis@@ continued ( see section 4.@@ 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on examination of interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ ine , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in the au@@ c of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) result in a reduction in the au@@ c of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance from the cervi@@ x and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( of present data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the break @-@ up of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic effect . &quot;
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on occurred AL@@ T @-@ An@@ chor@@ us over the three @-@ fold of the upper limit of the normal division also often referred to as under placebo but more rarely as in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was by 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch , rarely over cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was reported by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was applied in combination with insulin or in patients suffering from cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; there was a summary analysis of messages in@@ desirable events with regard to bone broo@@ ks from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blin@@ ded clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with more than 8,@@ 400 patients treated in comparison with compar@@ atively medication @-@ treated groups . &quot;
&quot; during a period of 3.5 years running pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients who were treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ G ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ G ) , which results in the animal model to increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fats and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and boo@@ sts the peri@@ ph@@ ere glucose in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has continued over two years to investigate the period until the retro@@ fitting of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar control could be maintained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ e@@ ased study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar have been inadequate in spite of three @-@ month optim@@ izing phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continued only insulin ; a reduction in the insulin @-@ treated group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one Group was observed . &quot;
in clinical studies over a year a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ a compared to the initial results .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small hall on type @-@ 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ ph@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as minor , but clin@@ ically not observed significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ mi@@ gly@@ ph@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
in comparison to placebo a significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels have been observed while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d dimin@@ ished values have been observed .
in a study over 20 weeks we reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des levels that both have an effect on tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to hep@@ atic Tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , it is quickly absorbed by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one where the top @-@ centric pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can generally be reached for 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ Studies , it has been proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical company of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ ine , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) and lowers the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ ers , the mark@@ er became mainly found in the waste ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elim@@ inations of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is for people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the entire active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function , but with a limited kidney function , the cr@@ ates of the oral clearing @-@ fabric is similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and apes , according to repeated administration of plasma @-@ enlargement with bun@@ als , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible cardi@@ ac disease . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which decreases in the form of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ a@@ emia and increased insulin resistance from the cervi@@ x , and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced by hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ureth@@ ane epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) conducted the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ India to an increased frequency of collagen .
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ er &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the estimated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with the number of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparison @-@ medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 Fra@@ tures per 100 patient years ) associated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 Fra@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients treated with a comparison @-@ medication . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated .
in clinical studies over one year a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ a compared to the initial results .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has reduced not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des levels , this both via a effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was l@@ acked the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , a combination of the overall lic@@ ality , non @-@ fatal cor@@ on@@ ar@@ isation , hypo@@ amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arteries , the results are close that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are not associated with cardiovascular @-@ long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages in@@ desirable events with regard to bone broo@@ ks from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and had an increased incidence of bone broo@@ ks in women . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 Fra@@ tures per 100 patient years ) associated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 Fra@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients treated with a comparison @-@ medication . &quot;
in a study over 20 weeks reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but improved in addition the increasing tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ as levels that both have an effect on tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to hep@@ atic Tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d synthesis .

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e was studied in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as can produce no insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use the insulin . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ um h@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates , how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which pointed out that the blood sugar levels are similarly strong as with another human body .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ oid ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the packing situation ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Imp@@ act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ ap@@ han@@ e is predomin@@ ate in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
October 2002 shared the European Commission of Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e across the European Union .

&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels after two to four weeks is still over 6 mg per December , the dose can be increased once every day by 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , still poison accidents can still occur ; this is why patients are recommended at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , further medicines for preventing off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; the drug is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant , since it was not studied for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , participating in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three types of different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to a placebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ ters ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine to treat hypertension ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
&quot; main indic@@ ative for the effectiveness was the number of patients , their ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood at the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l lay . &quot;
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg consumed , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who had once daily 120 mg during the last three measurements in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was with 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and not one of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart defects within the pre @-@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Imp@@ act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ureth@@ ra blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to urine tests ( including one from the medical history known or currently present po@@ cht@@ ing and / or a gyp@@ sum ) . &quot;
if the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ bo@@ xing brack@@ et still amounts to 2 @-@ 4 weeks and still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; in case of patients with severe kidney disease , effectiveness and security have not been completely investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ tra Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;

cardiovascular diseases For patients with isch@@ a@@ esthesia or de@@ offset cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency will not be recommended treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ cul@@ ated medicines , it may occur during the treatment starting to become an acute toxicity in the tissue , because the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ osed gels can be mobili@@ zed in tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , les@@ bian diseases ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine can rise so far in the urine in rare cases , that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease Dur@@ ing the clinical studies of phase 3 have been observed minor abnorm@@ alities of the liver function compared with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; it is therefore recommended before the start of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e@@ treatment , and in the further course , depending on the clinical payment , a liver function will perform ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ aire has not been conducted an in@@ effective studies on Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ inhi@@ bited can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ otion of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .

&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long@@ time extension studies in the open long@@ time extension studies were treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the research @-@ related studies reported during the period of long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in the studies of the Phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups altogether more than once , and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long@@ time period studies ( up to 4 years with a exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to the details . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events have either not reported in the Pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or at a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of the Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX trial and F@@ act study as described below ) which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; the primary Wir@@ ks@@ am@@ ity point was in every study the share of patients , with which the last three month @-@ specific ser@@ um har@@ n@@ bags &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ denti@@ al value to study of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX trial showed a significant superiority in terms of lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ bags under 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and Fig@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
&quot; the F@@ act study showed a significant superiority in regard to the lasting lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ bo@@ xing cell under 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the traditional dosage Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg daily . &quot;

the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ bags at &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in Week 2 and maintain permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancers &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al @-@ operation , the AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney disease ( i.e. h ) . &quot;
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point has been reached by 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ei@@ c acid concentrations in pro@@ gangs , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney failure ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ei@@ c acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( Bas@@ eline ) a ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ei@@ c acid of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; in two years the data collected from an open inter@@ extension study during the Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ bags must be applied to &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) a decrease of the incidence required in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a gyp@@ sy ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of pl@@ aster size , which had 54 % of the patients had a complete disappearance of the weight loss until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also received patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long@@ time period studies ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .

&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in Au@@ c is observed that is greater than the dos@@ is@@ let rise . &quot;
after taking simple or multi @-@ pler doses from 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the c@@ max amounts approximately 2.@@ 8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in percentage decline has been observed if this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state @-@ distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range of 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ map@@ le band@@ aging of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is controlled by the concentration width which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

special patients groups kidney failure After the intake of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at does not change in proportion to pro@@ gangs with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the middle total Au@@ c from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took around the 1.8 @-@ times of 7,5 μ g . h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g of h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disorder in which the bone broo@@ ks are used ) in women after men@@ opause in which a risk for a low vitamin D mirror exists .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may take care of after the first food intake of the day , which should be done at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 have already been separated from each other in medicines , which are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and the published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the share of patients with low @-@ vitamin D mirror were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also placed data in front of the data contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , exactly the dose that is required for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus , such as abdom@@ inal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ection , diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( bul@@ b ) , ul@@ cer@@ ated abdom@@ en ( born belly ) , as well as aci@@ di@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with et@@ less hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( ger@@ low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand at least 30 minutes long or sit . &quot;
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 shared the European Commission at Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; D@@ oh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the acquisition of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with an excerpt of a button on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of drugs ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following critics are exactly to follow to decrease the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE are supposed to be swal@@ lowed by day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ultim@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not go before the first food intake of the day , which should be carried out 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tics , can be given only under particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ultim@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al rop@@ sions , were rarely reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially , they were severe and required a hospital reference ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms which should be advised on possible solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain while lo@@ op@@ ting or retro@@ sp@@ icious pain or new or become bl@@ ending So@@ d@@ burn the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of heavy ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or it , according to the occurrence of symptoms that point to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all Do@@ atisation instructions will be passed on to the patients and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no elevated risk has been determined , rarely ( after market introduction ) ga@@ stri@@ c and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including Oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , has been reported in cancer patients , whose therapy ime is predominantly named intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to give the notes , whether the deriv@@ ative of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a ortho@@ don@@ tic surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating doctor is author@@ itative for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take advantage of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning after having noticed her failures .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
&quot; other disorders that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated adequately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium @-@ supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resili@@ ence of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes before taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ studies have not been carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only planned to apply post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy nor by breastfeeding women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not allow anything to be directly ashamed of the effects of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports have been reported by cancer patients , but also on oste@@ opor@@ os@@ ep@@ ics were reported . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Ab@@ str@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ d came to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um - phosph@@ ate to &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;

&quot; fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and afterwards 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least one new spine ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is administered up adult patients where a kidney or liver transplan@@ ts to prevent a rep@@ lication of the transplan@@ ted organ@@ s by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study conducted in 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients where the transplan@@ tation was replaced after a period of treatment by one year ( by example examined how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a revival of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
&quot; in addition , more studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were carried out with liver transp@@ l@@ ant and examined how Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is recorded in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with et@@ less hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro lid antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ ile , as the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the same medication must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

&quot; only doctors , who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should make this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to transplan@@ tation , or to increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including underground or immun@@ o@@ idal properties . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; transformations of the formulation or of the regime should be carried out only under the eng@@ masch@@ y control of a trained medical device ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in consequence of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment should be carried out to make sure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ing and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood levels ( see below &quot; &quot; Re@@ commen@@ dations &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down@@ level should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a Tal@@ mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and le@@ tu@@ fted patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure to immediate after@@ no@@ ons .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady State is achieved . &quot;
&quot; if the state of the patient is not allowed in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrations for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) will be introduced with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application Z@@ ur suppression of transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; consequently , the maximum duration of the oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transp@@ l@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis use The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dosage adjustment can be later required , as the phar@@ mac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transp@@ l@@ ant treatment The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ age recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be asked for a transp@@ l@@ ant of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f so this change in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , to be done . &quot;
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant after a switch from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once daily the treatment with each in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation recommended oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transp@@ osition .
&quot; transp@@ l@@ ant For adult patients who are converted to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily in the morning . &quot;
other transplan@@ tation receiver does not exist any clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary lung cancer - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day with panic @-@ gra@@ ined patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day and with intestinal tra@@ ilers in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patients with reduced liver function zinc for maintenance of blood mirror in the protected area can be required in patients with severe liver causes a reduction of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function does not affect the pharmaceutical ul@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular basis of ser@@ um cancer levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switch from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f At switching from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable with caution ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the Tal@@ mirror in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and compatibility in the individual case under state @-@ gaining of full @-@ bloo@@ dies@@ t tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level control .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood pressure levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full bleeding ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady state entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the blood levels in the blood will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
in clinical practice the Tal@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood lies in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and di@@ gest@@ ed patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac tra@@ ilers , bleeding in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ tation , or other side @-@ effects which might occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; transformations of the formulation or of the regime should be carried out only under the eng@@ masch@@ y control of a trained medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 inch treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therapy @-@ resistant , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transp@@ l@@ ant of adult cardi@@ op@@ tics and transplan@@ tation , in childhood there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions resulting in a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ at@@ um ) is included , or other plant remedies during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ o concentrations is offered in the blood as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , one referred to as cardi@@ ac disease called chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which therefore can also occur under ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid burden and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothes or use of solar protection using a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients suffer the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pris@@ es such as head@@ ache , changed awareness of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; because Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ cap@@ es , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose included , is available in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ t@@ arian g@@ act@@ ose @-@ intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ sc@@ act@@ ose @-@ painting . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of pharmaceuticals or herbal remedies which are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or decrease . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ation - blood levels in the simultaneous occurrence of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction with An@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka , such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ ar@@ az@@ ol , as well as with the Macro@@ lid @-@ antibiotic in Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies studies that the increase in blood levels mainly resulting from the increased oral bi@@ ver@@ ability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhi@@ bitions of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism , results . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ do@@ si@@ fied pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used with acute de@@ posit@@ ories , the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower in the blood . &quot;
&quot; effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs , which can be metabolic by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which can affect metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus can increase hormone exposure , in decisions about emp@@ t@@ arian measures should be particularly careful . &quot;
the results of animal trials have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially potentially reduce the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can prolong their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transp@@ l@@ ant patients do not supply that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants have an increased risk of unwanted events in terms of the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; at uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the newborn into possible harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ re@@ mia of the new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) i.e. :
the equivalent profile of immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants can often be determined exactly because of the under@@ age of patients and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below are the side @-@ effects listed after their incidence in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( incidence on the basis of the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well @-@ known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants is treated with patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ ale ) frequently increases . &quot;
cases of B@@ K @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi @-@ fo@@ al leu@@ ko@@ encephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ mes including EB@@ V@@ - associations , lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high bond to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plas@@ map@@ rot@@ one can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; active mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be convey@@ ed the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by his bond to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ish protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the nucleus . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ ous inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction due to the T cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific range of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sup@@ presses the activation of the T @-@ cells and the proliferation of the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ins ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recept@@ ors . &quot;

&quot; in total , the security profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies took the observations of the great trials in which Pro@@ gra@@ f in liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac tra@@ des@@ men was applied to the primary immune response . &quot;
&quot; l@@ apping transp@@ l@@ ant In an interim analysis about a recent , multi@@ centric trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported on 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; also a chronic transplan@@ tation , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ literary syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transp@@ l@@ ant ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;

&quot; in a study , the incidence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ tis ob@@ literary - syn@@ dro@@ ms in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients was significantly lower . &quot;
pancre@@ atic study involving oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out on 205 patients who received simultaneously a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation which received after a random@@ ized method of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .

&quot; factors such as a lower tumor value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the in@@ separ@@ ator group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a result of treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids which are to be responsible for the higher clearing @-@ rates observed after the transp@@ l@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this can conclude that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out over the g@@ alle . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the overall tt@@ ag@@ es@@ d@@ osis , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was about 10 % lower than under proportions . &quot;

advent is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( one by lack of factor VIII @-@ conditioned , innate blood pressure disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of application are directed after the treatment of bleeding in the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with her@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII defect which causes bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method that is referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human Ger@@ inn@@ ess factor in VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is approved by another in the European Union called Re@@ am@@ ate , similar , is however different , so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children less than six years , the application of the drug was investigated using the prevention of bleeding and in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ iso@@ den with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; has been evaluated . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ates ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies towards factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to approve the approval of Adv@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy is based on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency . after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following here@@ tical events the factor VIII @-@ activity will not sink in the appropriate period of time under the specified plastic pipe ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute distur@@ ban@@ ces are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) repeat until the threat for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment shift , the control of the weigh@@ ted dose and the incidence of injections is an appropriate measurement of the factor VIII of the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ as@@ ants . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different levels of half times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis use for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe her@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 g by factor VIII per kg of body weight at the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not dominated by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out , in order to prove an in@@ em@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high levels of inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so other therapeutic interventions must be enforced . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed is to be directed after the patient &apos;s payment , whereby maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known compensation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atorial activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereas the risk within the first 20 expe@@ ditions is the biggest and genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; with pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with over 100 extru@@ days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ sch known inhibit@@ ors @-@ development , has been observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the res@@ ett@@ lement of ( reduced ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of the ha@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation is not a matter of experience . &quot;
&quot; the as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had previously untreated patients who had a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;

blood cl@@ ot@@ ting has been maintained throughout time and both the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the clearing rate showed sufficient values on 15 post@@ operative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) only showed one patient after 26 Ex@@ posi@@ tional days with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.@@ 4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition to the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical trial formed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , lab parameters and measured side effects . &quot;
&quot; one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant increase and an ongoing peak of antibodies against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise there have been no sign of signs or symptoms described upon an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were destroyed over the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes at several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first acquisition , the CH@@ MP has continued to assess the benefits risk - to be considered positively , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the safety pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the regulatory approval should apply in 5 years with a further extension procedure . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited distributed to the Committee on Human Physi@@ otherapy ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ d cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the ordination of tissues ( tissues which combines other structures in the body , surrounds and leans ) . &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of virus that genetically modified , that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has changed so that there are no copies of themselves , and thus no infections in humans can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein once again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein that is made of which is not broken in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ d @-@ cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene defective is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer@@ ous cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a study conducted by a patient , at Li @-@ Frau@@ d Cancer in the field of teaching , into the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had tested the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the assessment of submitted documents , CH@@ MP generated 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has advantages for the patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medication in the body , the kind of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not know the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; Com@@ mit @-@ Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so merged , that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy against pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al @-@ sne@@ aker &apos;s swelling . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ sne@@ aker ( hidden nose ) , are deduc@@ ted . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective data were the changes in the severity of the ha@@ y fever that were reported by the patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all ha@@ y @-@ ens@@ la@@ ins except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who recorded aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to the patients who took Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ate alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nose @-@ sne@@ aker was seen , patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed an allevi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % against the patient , who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ i ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , or@@ der@@ ex@@ ia ( pom@@ p@@ lessness ) , con@@ ges@@ tion , headaches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ ni@@ ol@@ enz ( beats ) , in@@ dys@@ functions and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ h or any of the other components , against in@@ ep@@ in@@ si@@ fication agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine to treat allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a Eng@@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ roid disease ( over@@ flow of thy@@ roid ) or have already caused a hem@@ ost@@ al stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission approved the company SP Europe for approval for the marketing of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is in the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. , without having to dis@@ rupt or to di@@ gest ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data on the integrity and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of time on 10 days , since with long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ h can be off with time . &quot;
&quot; after the fall of the swelling , in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued when needed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ h contains , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity at combined use of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ els with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors , per@@ go@@ lid , dy@@ nasty , dy@@ nasty , dy@@ nasty rhin@@ ocer@@ os , dy@@ nasty , dy@@ nasty , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been tested for this patient collective collective and the data are not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data is not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about that treatment at occurrence of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or of p@@ ach@@ y@@ ances , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or a rein@@ forcement of headaches ) must be reset . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hypertension , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bub@@ bles or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should be aver@@ ted at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological testing since Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent .
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Des@@ ir@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed . &quot;
&quot; with the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether mis@@ lor@@ ries are taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; that is not yet identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ ir@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes , so interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ ph@@ one .
&quot; the irregul@@ arity of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to experience experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since Re@@ production studies on animals do not always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ cal properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ h , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be educated about it that it can occur in very rare cases to a ben@@ om@@ men@@ ness , which can lead to a distur@@ ban@@ ces of traffic noise , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , kom@@ a , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ adm@@ ills ) with possible let@@ tering procedures . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , frigh@@ tening mi@@ xes , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , infl@@ or@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , melanchol@@ y , Tinnitus , athe@@ ism , ten@@ sion@@ ists and hyp@@ ot@@ ony or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is most likely in children , as well as A@@ trop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin tr@@ ums , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
these include both the Hem@@ p of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human corn cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the Ad@@ hem@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ lec@@ tic P @-@ selection on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per cells . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective r@@ ack@@ iness or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
controlled clinical trials has been found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ h in recommended dosage may cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ am@@ in@@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by means of the total scores for the Sympt@@ om@@ atics ( except nose @-@ loop swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ h over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the decreasing effect , determined by the nose @-@ loop , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic group . &quot;
as part of a single dose study for Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in within 30 minutes after the administration in plasma det@@ ectable .
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy proportions over 14 days , the fly @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ h has been reached in the day 10 . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study , which was carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult pro@@ ban@@ des , has been found that four subjects of the disaster have been poorly made . &quot;
&quot; a component Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ study indicates that exposure ( C@@ max and Au@@ c ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ h according to the omni@@ v@@ ases of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ a@@ esthesia was in exposure to the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security concerns , toxicity in repeated gift , to toxicity and reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data can be seen with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in however no special dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination does not have greater toxicity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ye . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive @-@ geological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ h was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day non ter@@ at@@ ogenic . &quot;

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight trials with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by identifying the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the h@@ add@@ ling , draw@@ backs of sleep and efficiency in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body balances the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ ing and mel@@ ting tab@@ letten in the same way as the tablets and the use of children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the reduction of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us must not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 shared the European Commission of SP Europe for approval by A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ving the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and Persian allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ ries in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease shift , and may end after the end of symptoms and can be resum@@ ed when re @-@ occur . &quot;
&quot; in the pers@@ isting allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment . &quot;
clinical @-@ related interactions were found in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in the simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol is not ampli@@ fied ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be educated about it that it can occur in very rare cases concerning ben@@ om@@ men@@ ities , which can lead to a distur@@ ban@@ ces of traffic noise , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us as in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most commonly used side effects that was reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth@@ dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patient from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect headaches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and with 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ disciplinary study , administered up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
this includes both the Hem@@ p of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human corn cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the Ad@@ hem@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular P @-@ selection on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple ho@@ d@@ oses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in dosage administered up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study that was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) over ten days was no extension of Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; at a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no effect on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective r@@ ack@@ iness or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent rhin@@ itis and pers@@ isting allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by means of the total amount of cargo to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ sub@@ sec@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the burden caused by seasonal rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investig@@ ating other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ology regardless of the e@@ ti@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited simple pro@@ pul@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as the history of history is a primary factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al conditions , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in besides the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria leads to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pris@@ y@@ itus and the descent of size and number of Qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dosage inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the Min@@ ority of the patients , who were not responded to Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement by it@@ ching around more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmaceutical @-@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal mal@@ itis associated with the general seasonal rhin@@ itis -@@ Pop@@ ulation , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of distill@@ ation . &quot;
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant grief after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , that is not yet identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ ir@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes , so interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ ph@@ one .
in a single dos@@ .com study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg real meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) do not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
the clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in carried out pre@@ clinical trials at a comparable degree of exposure from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the toxicity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security concerns , toxicity in repeated gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the realisation of the pre@@ clinical data can be seen with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no special dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; Color@@ less film ( includes l@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ oh@@ hydr@@ ate , hy@@ go@@ l tit@@ anium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ l 400 ) , Car@@ nau@@ ba@@ w@@ s , baked wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms associated with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and Persian rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis are caused by children under 2 years of infection ( see under Section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available to support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should be played in the diagnosis the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin examination . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic distur@@ ban@@ ces are limited and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ load ( see below Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , the met@@ aboli@@ ze metabolic , is identical to those in children that are normally metabolic . &quot;

in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in the simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol are not ampli@@ fied ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup Group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us as in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ disciplinary study on adults and young people , in which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who arrived for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily disaster dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated by adults to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multi @-@ multiple examinations , adults and adolescents , used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially shared its application for approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people for the protection against influenza caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 des In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause before a strain of the grip virus that could cause future pan@@ demic .
an influenza pan@@ demic breaks out when a new strain of the grip virus emerges that can easily spread from man to human because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus as &quot; physical &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the immune system will later be able to form a contact with a grip @-@ virus of this Stam@@ ets of fast antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the di@@ aphr@@ ag@@ m of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which recognizes the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; an inspection of some of the studies showed that the study was not carried out under the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA Guid@@ elines for pre@@ pan@@ demic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical examination and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , it stands as a solution for inclusion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; if the doctor should then be prescribed , if the doctor has tested which anti@@ viral medicines has previously taken before , and the likelihood has assessed the virus to appeal to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Knights and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose is calculated by the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , the HIV amounts decreases in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS does not cure , however , the damage of the immune system can also delay the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; generic drugs were investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; the large do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines used in 20@@ 6 adults , who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ or , with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants . &quot;
major Indi@@ c@@ ator for effectiveness was the share of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or the modification of the viral burden after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ or , although after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but it was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; for children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased Vir@@ us@@ last but also of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase , very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase , lowered the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste from the virus last after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase : &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects of aqu@@ a ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and Fatima ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; generic drugs may not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rant &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are just as static in the blood of health and are detri@@ mental to high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV , patients suffering from renewable energies ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that will be caused by the immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Physi@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of renewable energy use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children aged over four years compared to risks .
&quot; generic drugs is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee noted that the use of A@@ generic drugs in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission issued the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to receive approval for the marketing of renewable energies throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
for usually a@@ stro capsules are intended to be administered for the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ spec@@ avi@@ r should be carried out under consideration of the individual viral rem@@ n@@ oses and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of amp@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % lower than from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ ills twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If a general capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ zing ) , higher doses may be applied to aqu@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs , up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the pharmaceuticals , effectiveness and safety of aqu@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; aqu@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on the integrity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver disorder at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously to medicines that have a small therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations which include St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ at@@ um ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the ing@@ es@@ tion of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that a generic infection or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with axi@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy , have an increased risk to severe liver impacts with potentially fatal course . &quot;
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information concerning this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis also demonstrate an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ aca or other Glu@@ c@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids will not be recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of systemic corro@@ sive effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and repression of the adren@@ al @-@ function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the metabolism of H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended as a simultaneous administration of astronomy with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the substance con@@ centric . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plas@@ m@@ as@@ ants of amp@@ spec@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r may be the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of risk of toxicity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ ons , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients . &quot;
&quot; generic drugs should be reduced to 5 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ m are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an expedition of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases including therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated . &quot;
&quot; with h@@ bi@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ ect ( type A and B ) , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous kut@@ aner h@@ is@@ ome and ha@@ mar@@ thro@@ ats . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ defect can develop a inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy body @-@ measure index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with lower therapeutic width , may not simultaneously be given to medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with lower therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be associated with drugs , whose active ingredients are mainly related to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for the increased plastic p@@ as@@ ants connected with heavy and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is causing a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ met@@ rolog@@ ical failure and to a resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the low plastic pipe through a dosage increase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very often observed unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
cur@@ rant &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ at@@ um ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ at@@ um ) .
&quot; if a patient is cur@@ rant cur@@ rant , the spec@@ kled mirror and , if possible , to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and put the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ d below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
in clinical studies dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to the effectiveness and integrity of this treatment schem@@ atics .
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administered .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached in combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered . &quot;
&quot; a me@@ tering advice for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , there will be a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring , since the effectiveness and integrity of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the non@@ ci@@ d component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ d in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) do not require a dosage adjustment . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ d in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine reduces the ser@@ um concentration of amp@@ spec@@ avi@@ r possibly .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic pipe . &quot;
&quot; when these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous occurrence of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( Au@@ c ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin @-@ associated side effects .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data will be available . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies in combination with Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin has not been carried out , however , the plas@@ pi@@ as@@ ants of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in the comparison to the value that has been observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ gi@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with Asp@@ ase , possibly to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with map@@ le . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase , it is advisable that ant@@ acid may not be taken at the same time as ather@@ ase as it can come to res@@ entment . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ ants that are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of plastic p@@ as@@ ants from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , pine @-@ pin , ni@@ car@@ pine , ni@@ b di@@ pin , ni@@ b di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by amp@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ ic@@ ity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with Asp@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to commission rates rose by approximately 86 % increase ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous occurrence of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ k@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of systemic corro@@ bor@@ ons ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases of the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ires in the simultaneous administration of gases . &quot;
&quot; as plasma terminals of these H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of therapeu@@ tical concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in the simultaneous occurrence of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral bi@@ ased mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while on the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors point out to a possible increase in the plastic pipe of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the small di@@ ligence of historical comparisons , no recommendation is given , such as the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is adjusted , when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; while in the simultaneous occurrence of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ lab@@ ia , an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ ws ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predic@@ tible so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the simultaneous occurrence of aqu@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy , only after careful consideration of the possible usage for the mother , compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk de@@ activ@@ ating rats , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r goes to people in the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ production study on toler@@ ated rats , which was administered by the inser@@ tion in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed during the lac@@ tation period of the 12 body weight . &quot;
the further development of the offspring including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ productive capacity has not been affected by the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to the dam@@ tier .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the A@@ gener@@ ase @-@ treatment associated side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early and rarely resulted in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events is not clarified , whether they are applied in connection with the intake of Aqu@@ ariums or another at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase has not been pro@@ secuted twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were used by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study medication , and with more than 1 % of patients were used , as well as the treatment changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) . &quot;

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations for the analysis of the results of pesti@@ cides . &quot;
on a phenomenal resistance @-@ based analysis clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otype systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otype of the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otype cut off ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a pesti@@ cides . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to amp@@ ut@@ viol@@ r genetic patterns creates a certain crus@@ hing resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on crus@@ hed between Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ons , for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ gi@@ avi@@ r Res@@ cue point , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally untreated patients ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ car@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r retains his activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early breakdown of a dil@@ uted therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that may affect the following treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of Aqu@@ ariums in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults according to vi@@ ro@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lower p@@ aired Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; have received . &quot;
&quot; sixty @-@ thre@@ e@@ und@@ sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to the no@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ jug@@ ation of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group with regard to the time @-@ charged average rate ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral value ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks fixed at a non @-@ sub@@ genital shaft of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of im@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
it was not given a low do@@ si@@ ly Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r simultaneously ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration by &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ terranean increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the raw value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cally on this data should be considered in treatment optim@@ isation at PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; im@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; A@@ generic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for c@@ max by 30 % reduction , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of amp@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of the Au@@ c , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration in ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake although the simultaneous food intake affects the scale and rate of resistance . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an immense penetration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall con@@ centric of the substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ connected Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which represents an active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active component during the Do@@ atisation inter@@ v@@ alls in dependence on the total doctor @-@ Con@@ centr@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs must indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or pose inhibit@@ ing or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution when they are given simultaneously with no@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r exposure , such as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ directional than out of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and no@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of kidney disorder is likely to be reduced to the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing are comparable to those who are at healthy pro@@ gangs after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for c@@ ess@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared among male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ular Aden@@ omas with dos@@ ages ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ples ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily offering of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of hep@@ at@@ ular aden@@ oids and car@@ cin@@ omas were not yet applied and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; from the present appearance data on the human being , both from clinical studies as well as for therapeu@@ tical application , however , there were little evidence of accepting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ tion tests , the bacterial re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ tests on rats and chromos@@ ome blades were neither mut@@ agen@@ s neither mut@@ ages nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , there have been no significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during the administration of a@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated by an age of 4 days , demonstrated by both the check@@ ups and the animals treated with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic sculpture which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage among humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus changes , and minor skel@@ etal changes observed that indicate to a hesit@@ ated development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If a general capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ zing ) , higher doses may be applied to aqu@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs , up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be done with caution in patients with schizophren@@ ia or lighter liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some drugs , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , which are available for determining the substance con@@ centric . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced in duration 27 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ m are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is causing a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ met@@ rolog@@ ical failure and to a resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached in combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered . &quot;
&quot; a me@@ tering advice for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , there will be a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring , since the effectiveness and integrity of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ d in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ or would be low .
&quot; when these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data will be available . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , pine @-@ pin , ni@@ car@@ pine , ni@@ b di@@ pin , ni@@ b di@@ pin , ni@@ car@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ ic@@ ity of these drugs . &quot;
in a clinical trial in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to commission rates rose by approximately 86 % increase ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; while in the simultaneous occurrence of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ lab@@ ia , an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ ws ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous appointments of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.9 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in Au@@ c and C@@ min by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy , only after careful consideration of the possible usage for the mother , compared to the possible risks to the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ production study on toler@@ ated rats , which was administered by the in@@ ist@@ ung in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of deliber@@ ation , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supportive policies . &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is in the area of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r retains his activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , this should be considered to be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; inf@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; A@@ gener@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active component during the Do@@ atisation inter@@ v@@ alls in dependence on the total doctor @-@ Con@@ centr@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs must indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or pose inhibit@@ ing or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution when they are given simultaneously with no@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of kidney disorder is likely to be neg@@ li@@ gible to the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for c@@ ess@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ular Aden@@ omas with dos@@ ages ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ples ( rat ) of exposure to people twice daily offering of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the genesis of hep@@ at@@ ogenic Aden@@ omas and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not yet been overcome and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; from the present appearance data on the human being , both from clinical trials and from therapeu@@ tical use , however , little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ tion tests , the bacterial re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , M@@ k@@ ern@@ test tests on rats and chromos@@ om@@ od@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ages nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated by an age of 4 days , demonstrated by both the check@@ ups and the animals treated with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals . &quot;
&quot; these results conclude that in Jung@@ le the Met@@ abol@@ ishing passages are not yet fully mature , so that Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase ( PI ) re@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take up was neither associated with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of amp@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is 14 % lower than from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the intake of the solution to deposit ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs , up to a daily over@@ dose of 2@@ 800 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , since no Dos@@ age recommendations must be given to the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to one and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patients . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction to a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ li@@ cles is a gener@@ ase solution to inclusion in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women who contra@@ dict patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ or of the metabol@@ ization of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be pointed out that a generic infection or any other anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with axi@@ ase does not prevent the risk 47 of a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the substance con@@ centric . &quot;
&quot; generic drugs should be reduced to duration when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ m are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

&quot; the applic@@ ability and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a are dependent on the treat@@ able condition : • With F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital area , Al@@ dar@@ a is up to a maximum of 16 weeks for a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell cycles , it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles to get three times weekly . &quot;
&quot; the cream is in front of bed@@ time thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected skin areas , so they have enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it will be washed away . &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four basic studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
&quot; main indic@@ ative for the efficacy was the number of patients treated with full dismantling of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell disease in two studies , where patients were treated six weeks or placebo either daily or five times weekly . &quot;
main indic@@ ative for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete intervals of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area the total breakdown rate amounted to 56 % to 80 % with the patients infected with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ ot@@ ic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ches ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ ent adults , if the size or the number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before embar@@ go , and 6 to 10 hours long on the skin . &quot;
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all the visible f@@ eig@@ ts in the genital or Peri@@ od area disappeared ; or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period .
&quot; any interruption in the treatment process should occur if intensive local inflamm@@ ations occur , see section 4.@@ 4 ) or when in the treatment area an infection is observed . &quot;
&quot; if during Fol@@ low @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was left out , the patient should carry out the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is in a thin layer , and in the framed , with F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts of infected skin area , until the cream was completely moved . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , the risk of treatment is handled by the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible toler@@ able of their autoimmune disease . &quot;
it should be subject to this patient a subscription between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rep@@ ul@@ ment or gra@@ ft versus @-@ host@@ esses .
&quot; in other studies in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ oring hygiene was performed , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis were observed and a case with one to the circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ ction were observed . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk of heavy local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed under proper use of heavy local skin irritation , which made a treatment necessary and / or lead to a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occur at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine that needed an emergency athe@@ ter@@ isation and the treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , directly following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous methods for the treatment of external F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital and period of time , there are no clinical experiences so far . &quot;
limited data indicate an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ war@@ ring reductions in HIV positive patients with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient with regard to the removal of F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts .
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell disease with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm of the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form according to the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is required due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local hood actions , a treatment plan may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as currently , no data on long @-@ term healing rates are available for more than 36 months after treatment , should consider super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell disease or other suitable therapeutic forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not lie any clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of the response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are limited data on the application of I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ al ker@@ at@@ ants to anatom@@ ical sites outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the data available on the ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis in the under@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application . therefore , such application will not be recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions to the patient cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment can be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 nuclear les@@ ions becomes a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not assume any direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / federal development , the ab@@ dic@@ ation or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after non @-@ recurring ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation to apply during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly referred and as probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with three @-@ three @-@ weeks treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported and than probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of side effects , complaints with an incidence of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
the patients treated by 185 to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated in a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common one as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of side @-@ effect were a reaction at the application of application ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
&quot; the side effects that have been indicated by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ e@@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; this according to the verification plan provided by the clinical signs shows that it came into this placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three @-@ three @-@ controlled clinical trials , including Er@@ y@@ them@@ an cream ( 61 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / Wr@@ ite ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this according to the verification plan provided by the clinical signs shows that it came into these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often to heavy brass topics ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and to severe schizophren@@ ic and c@@ ess@@ ation ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies for the investigation of the application of i@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ al ker@@ at@@ osis was Alo@@ pe@@ zie with an incidence of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) in the treatment of treatment or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the vast@@ ly unique or@@ ale intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bag , could cause nausea , vom@@ iting , headaches , My@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side @-@ effect , which appeared after several or@@ als of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study were detected after the top@@ ographic application of I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od increased systemic concentrations of the alpha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
3 efficacy @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the efficacy in regards to a complete failure of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior to 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in 60 % of all 119 with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients healed the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts completely ; this was with 20 % of 105 with placebo @-@ based patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete cooling could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 16@@ 1 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ours were hist@@ ological and single primary super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell atoms with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically he@@ wn and these were also 48 months long . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyp@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic AK@@ - les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment are@@ as on the un@@ easy scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combin@@ able monitoring studies show patients with clin@@ ically withdraw@@ als after one or two treatment periods a recur@@ rent of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of extern@@ ally F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts , A@@ kt@@ ine ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally Bas@@ al cell @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma normally do not arise and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ized , double @-@ blind trials at children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Con@@ tag@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 3@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses examined doses ( 3@@ x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w .
a minimal system intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and wor@@ ded 0,@@ 1 , 0,@@ 2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml during the use in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 inser@@ tions ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the calculated obvious half @-@ time period was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ ho@@ dige half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study , which indicates a prolonged ret@@ ali@@ tion of the drug through the skin . &quot;
&quot; the data on systemic exposure showed that the resili@@ ence of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low on MC @-@ sufferers of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adult and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al@@ cell @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four months trial for the painting toxicity in the rat @-@ led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg to significantly reduced body weight and increased milk @-@ weight ; another four months long trial for the paint application revealed in the mouse no similar effects . &quot;
a two year @-@ year study for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity on mice during der@@ m@@ aler administration at three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application place .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and does not mut@@ ed mut@@ ages , is a risk for humans due to systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;

&quot; in the study primarily investig@@ ating the safety of the drug , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( by investig@@ ating its effect regarding reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; for children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normally big liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ ologies ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , pain @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place . &quot;
&quot; very frequent side @-@ effects in patients under five years have increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen @-@ satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sliding grid . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be strongly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .

&quot; the makers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 condemned the European Commission to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to approve of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ erst@@ shock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is available for the long @-@ term en@@ roll@@ ment therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the condition ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with all@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries it every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no Do@@ atisation scheme is recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined and for this patient no Do@@ atisation scheme is recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion reaction , which are defined as any associated side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , this patients should also continue to be monitored on eng@@ masch@@ y , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical environment , in which re@@ br@@ acing facilities for medical emergency cases are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients can form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since little experience is due to the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of risk reaction after an interruption of the treatment should be cautious . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or medium @-@ heavy in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be wo@@ ken and / or reducing the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction must be stopped by in@@ fusion , until the symptoms are taken to decline , treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the pre@@ dominant reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase consists .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns who were expon@@ entially from Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects in clinical trials conducted mainly as in@@ fusion reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients during the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study of 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
&quot; unwanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3@@ - trial and its extension for a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history occurred in addition to heavy reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , respiratory and facial ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ solic@@ ited pharmaceutical interactions in connection with all@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mostly severe form of treatment and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment to a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , where patients aged under 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to det@@ ectable by radio immun@@ op@@ tics ( R@@ IP ) As@@ wan demonstr@@ able antibodies , including 3 patients where there was never too Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ium . &quot;
patients suffering from low to low antibody levels has been a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n was as@@ certain@@ ed .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ al until low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro which did not affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of unwanted medication reactions , even though the occurrence of unwanted drug interactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ alization for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about cre@@ osis , 6 @-@ phosph@@ or@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were investigated in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ e@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study on 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients have been recru@@ ited for the study , which exp@@ elled the entire disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients have been recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute case in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ e- case test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label review study where they received for more 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me received .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients in relation to the placebo group improved an improvement in the lung function and the in@@ ability to be shown in the following table . &quot;
in the open di@@ version study an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 20@@ 8 weeks in der@@ al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group .
the decrease of the expected percentage of the FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung @-@ volum@@ et@@ ina increased further propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ ized alie ( 85 % ) , up to the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a marked waste of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established until the degree of study was constant .
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease between the patient , which has been taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant change carried out for five efficacy tests ( 58 % ) , no change in 26 patients ( 58 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients , which were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy shopping form and 4 with the medium @-@ sized shopping form ) . &quot;
&quot; for four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in multiple patients a magnitude of growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) , following the Z @-@ Score for these age group , the younger patients were faced with severe progression @-@ form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium @-@ sized study rate , whereas in the older patients with severe form @-@ to @-@ date only limited or no progress in cognitive performance were as@@ certain@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ atisation schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the Do@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent patients who have difficulties with weekly advertisers , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two Do@@ atisation is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to those with older and less severely affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have not been treated before , in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy agents previously . &quot;
&quot; to decrease side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be dis@@ ed up , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ alis@@ tically slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA , and avo@@ ids that the cells divide . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ alis@@ tically into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer active therapy in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a prime study of 4@@ 56 patients which had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta has been treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;

&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to references to tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are to be used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Market C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy has to be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient care the value before treatment . &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be dis@@ continued when patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ reductions or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or so@@ - continue when the level 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies have no notice that in patients aged 65 years or above , compared to patients under the age of 65 is an increased risk risk . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for the integrity and effectiveness .
clinical studies were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary that go beyond the dosage adap@@ tations for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functioning of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or Trans@@ am@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ viable of &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver metastatic breast ) were not particularly examined in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the button of Kno@@ - chen@@ mark@@ ers and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ers has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ - zy@@ th@@ ers reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ osis , Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ c@@ ents and maxim@@ ally non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ mat@@ ological toxicity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ri@@ le Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ amed if a pre @-@ line with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be instruc@@ ted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lak@@ tic measure for reduction and related toxicity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ surgical anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is provided , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ value is required for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients where these events arose , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid @-@ accumulation in the trans@@ cellular room , a dra@@ inage of the result can be done before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ ts , and cerebral rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administered into combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated vitality ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irreversible damage , the reproductive capacity exists through p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment process to obtain advice on locking assistance . &quot;
in patients with normal ren@@ al ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) tall cans non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed breakdown with the result of increased exposure of side effects .
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data related to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long @-@ term time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - fixed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the scent status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ alis@@ tically in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - An@@ tim@@ est@@ ol@@ ites are expected to occur during an application in pregnancy severe birth defect . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if it is strictly necessary and after careful consideration of the utility for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity exists through p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the treatment of treatment , consult with regard to the sperm volume . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ps into the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects in the distill@@ ery can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of unwanted effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , and the random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Er@@ - held as well as 16@@ 3 patients with Mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , who were random@@ ised Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in use of the Lun@@ - gen@@ cancer@@ ous symptom@@ sk@@ ala in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms were characterized by an improvement in the lung parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a contrac@@ tion of lung function over time in the control panel .

&quot; it is applied with overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , fatty nutrition . &quot;
&quot; patients who use All@@ i and have no weight reduction after 12 weeks , should contact their physician or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot de@@ build some fats in the food , thus causing approximately a quarter which is incompatible with the food @-@ run fats of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who recorded All@@ i 60 mg after one year , having an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 one could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects of All@@ i ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are desert spots at after , fle@@ atus ( winds ) with st@@ ace@@ able chair , stu@@ ffed secre@@ tion , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be applied to patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ @-@ rep@@ aid in transp@@ l@@ ant patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent cl@@ ots .
&quot; it must also not be applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term painting syndrome ( in which not sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract may suffer ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver illness ) , and in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers . &quot;
July 2007 designated the European Commission to the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to receive approval for the acquisition of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
&quot; alli is used for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body @-@ measure index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fet@@ al diet . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied by children and young people under 18 , since there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , because Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal resor@@ bed , is with older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or any of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chron@@ ic@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.@@ 6 ) • Con@@ figuration ( see section 4.@@ 6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likelihood of acquiring gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase when it is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli made a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients , the alli as well as medicines for hypertension or increased cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists , whether the dosage needs to be adjusted . &quot;
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent additional pregnant measures in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in multiple cases with simultaneous application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a distr@@ action of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel .
&quot; the use of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at could be influenced by the Quick values ( international norm@@ ative rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the standard . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended prior to bed@@ time a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ itamin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a single dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of volunteers were observed at the same time , a minor decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects have been identified from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( incidence on the basis of the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of what side @-@ known side effects , which were found after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events voluntarily reported by a population in@@ certain size . &quot;
also It is plau@@ si@@ bel that the treatment with alli made in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects can result .
&quot; single d@@ osen of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple multiple mg of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to norm@@ aland , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported after the market launch , either no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals , it can be traced by a rapid re@@ formation of a systematic system that can be traced to the li@@ tigation properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the ma@@ gen and the upper thin @-@ gut through kov@@ al@@ ente to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ y- and pan@@ cr@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical trials has been derived that 60 mg or@@ listing , taken three times daily , blocking the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ id controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 cover the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; primary parameters , the change of body weight towards the raw value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change in the degree of degree in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those studies that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first six months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholester@@ in amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.8 % ( raw value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.6 % ( raw value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at the Ta@@ ill@@ en@@ ference , the average change @-@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( raw value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of not metabolic Or@@ list@@ at were not measurable for 8 hours following the oral gift of 360 m@@ l or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , for therapeu@@ tical doses could not be metabolic orders in plasma just spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an injury . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy , which are a strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as with chemotherapy that are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug which can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
&quot; the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , since the effects contained in this age group does not exist enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the substance prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to prevent recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adult men who received heavy or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; with chemotherapy that are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of the patients were treated with al@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was not vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; at chemotherapy that are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of the patients were treated with Alo@@ xi ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
compared to Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
March 2005 shared the European Commission issued by Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for in@@ transport of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer treatment and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be ampli@@ fied by adding one prior to chemotherapy given in the cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on can extend the col@@ on , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ sc@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute le@@ ak@@ y after inj@@ ecting eng@@ agements . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 Ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable with the simultaneous presence of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t- interval is extended or which tend to be such an extender . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi will not be used to prevent the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;

&quot; in one on an Pop@@ ulation @-@ based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous offering of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , Hal@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , Ch@@ ong@@ e@@ tin , Ch@@ ong@@ e@@ tin , Ch@@ ie@@ tin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; experience to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on in human gest@@ ures are not before , therefore , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ on should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is considered to be necessary from the treat@@ able doctor . &quot;
clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ gram to observe side @-@ effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi related to headaches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions to the administration place ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest doses showed similar frequencies of unwanted events such as in the other doses , there were no dose @-@ effect relationships . &quot;
&quot; there have been no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis will probably not be effective therapy in alo@@ xi@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 c@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7 hours ) , that was given day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind review , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on , compared with patients who were 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron which were given 1 intraven@@ ous 1 intraven@@ ous . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ated chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; following the pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on has the ability to block and extend the ion @-@ channel of the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ polar@@ isation of the ion channels and to extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the 221 healthy pro@@ pon@@ ents carried out was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; reset After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations , a slow elimination of the body with an average period of time of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage range from 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in gest@@ ures and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous Gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean time between day 1 and day was 5 measured ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations occur that once daily , intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous value of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on on 3 consecutive days reached overall tex@@ tual appointments ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max was higher than 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys and some more 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on above less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on Met@@ abol@@ ization have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , which is involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on as un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ dness in gest@@ ures , the total body @-@ body was between 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver disorder the tempor@@ al elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on increases , a reduction of dose is thus not justified . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies have been observed only after expe@@ ditions , which are regarded as sufficient regarding the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre@@ clinical trials are evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on can only block in very high concentrations of I@@ onal channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ polar@@ isation and can extend the action period . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ etr@@ on ( each dose promised to about 30@@ 34 of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours ( in the thy@@ roid , pitu@@ itary , Pan@@ cre@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not on mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but because of the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined to use the unique application , the relevance of these results is assessed as for humans . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ itarian Imp@@ act ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative assessment in which the approval of the approval of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C using al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same general practitioner @-@ effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference Doc@@ tors &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( a viral infection caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; at a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissues cause damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme alan@@ ine Amin@@ o Amin@@ ov@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates this to the formation of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon laid data on the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , effect , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon is compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , measured how many patients were treated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment on the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the substance and the drug market does not suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , who spoke to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease has increased again in more patients than with the reference to the reference point of reference ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was evaluated in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ app@@ rais@@ al of inf@@ ecting skin infection ) and small infected @-@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or cutting @-@ cutting ) , dis@@ abling and paraly@@ zed wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , the det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ stru@@ ent st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go against this type of infections may not affect . &quot;
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but for patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface should not be used to be treated more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should study the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om ( the parts of the bacteria in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indic@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was abbrevi@@ ated after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo said to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected hood , Al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tes , about 90 % of the patients of both groups spoke to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( vain cav@@ ity in the body tissue ) or of infections , which have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation of the client .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Imp@@ act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ations , sc@@ rub@@ ber@@ ies or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
may 2007 the European Commission distributed the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union .
&quot; patients , during which two or three days will not show any improvement , should be investigated once again and be considered an alternative therapy ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation through the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is broken carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection started . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections , at which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogens or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with secondary and open wounds , the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ane @-@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment any improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected passage occurs .
the impact of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the small plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans for topical skin or infected @-@ superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant Hem@@ p does not expect to expect ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol elevated the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max on topical skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations are not necessary for , if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin will be applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a rec@@ tion@@ c@@ ic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the federal tale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ic anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to end , is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most frequently reported side @-@ effect of irritation in the administration of approximately 1 % of the patients considered . &quot;
&quot; agents in Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance , adapted by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ ery ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ mol@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific bond of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the hy@@ ac@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 are involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P bin@@ ds and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ able Centre .
by binding to this bond @-@ point hem@@ at@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer block to partial P @-@ ties interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler under@@ units .
&quot; should be considered due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infectious forms , should be a consultation by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates was delicate or resistant to meth@@ icillin . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ failure on the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Fel@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults became 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ographic treatment of secondary wounds , individual plastics were won . &quot;
the sampling took place on the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in case of medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours following the final application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic admission to the human being applied to topical application of 1 % sal@@ ine to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g ( h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or . &quot;

&quot; in studies on oral toxicity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not yet im@@ mu@@ te against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied within the framework of one consisting of two doses and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccine can be brought into an end from two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B can be given Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine .
vaccines have the effect of bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) as opposed to a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccination Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and the vaccination Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same disease , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix will be administered as part of a three @-@ dimensional plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of the vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective antibody con@@ centric one month after the last injection . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine is compared to six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children for hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had been similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the injections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appetite lack , pain at the injection site , redness , Mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients that are not applied to any other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 shared the European Commission to the G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix all over the world
&quot; the stand@@ ardis@@ ed plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered by the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her age is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ative vaccines or with a combination of combination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B and anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size order as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet completely backed up whether immun@@ otherapeu@@ tic individuals addressed to a hepatitis B vaccine , need to be a refres@@ her age as protection as it may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no more det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injections , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate ways of medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ f@@ scheme is recommended with the combination of combination that includes 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; with her@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis of patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , under circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody , is achieved so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could result in an optimal impact success , these injections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ ia or blood @-@ distur@@ ban@@ ces , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected along with sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular supply . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of a separate injection at the same time with a combined gas@@ p , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us the enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps vaccine administered , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients under immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune defective needs to be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mats , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier thi@@ om@@ atic and preserv@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
clinical studies have been given 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations in total 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ cans combination .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ing on a calculation base per vaccine , but not on a calculation base per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % with the pro@@ gangs after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ able .
&quot; after the complete vaccine , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects reported that Ambi@@ rix had administered up , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % with the subjects that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ozo@@ a was comparable ( i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the pros , the Ambi@@ rix got , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % with the subjects that received the 3 @-@ doses ( simp@@ lier ) . &quot;
the frequency distinctive ache and mat@@ ures was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ema .
in a comparative study on 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccines the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x group was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ able with 360 ELISA @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11@@ - olds , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix had a frequent appearance of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ ad@@ mill . &quot;

&quot; in clinical studies that were conducted at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ converted rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the Ser@@ o@@ converting rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second one to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination of three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was exploited , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ e@@ duction rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ tin containers were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical trial study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after ending the full vacc@@ inations ( ie in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination @-@ simp@@ lier with 360 ELISA @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
&quot; for individuals who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ema . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ re @-@ reaction against both anti@@ gens were comparable to that , based on vaccination of 3 cans with a combination of combination simp@@ ati@@ ans , consisting of 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ alized Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical study at 12@@ - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies are comparable 24 months to immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vacc@@ ema .

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as through bathing in the water @-@ waters contaminated water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a stupid face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( laughter ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child before the administration of both vaccines have already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick / feels ) a vaccination may not prevent an illness .
&quot; protection against other infections affecting the liver or symptoms that are similar to those according to a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves by it@@ ching skin irritation , respiratory or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • if you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the usually planned administration of the second vaccination ) . &quot;
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vacc@@ inated hepatitis ( 360 ELISA @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ inations of this vaccine with decreased content in effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection against the termination of the vacc@@ inations .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from people who suffer from serious bleeding disorders under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your body @-@ body def@@ ences / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons on vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is .
&quot; 21 Sa@@ gen you consult your doctor if you have / your child to take additional medicines , or if you have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without prescription / or if you have been given up / Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or has planned it in the near future . &quot;
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women is not given , except it is urgent to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain features of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) with you / your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
information very often ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) : • pain or discomfort in the sti@@ cking site or redness • mat@@ z@@ ability • headaches • appetite for loss of appetite
often ( up to 1 case per 10 ver@@ ted doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Ben@@ om@@ men@@ ness • gastro@@ intestinal symptoms
&quot; further side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination of hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) are : &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in Pack@@ ages 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the in@@ shipment , the CH@@ MP agreed that the benefits would have a positive effect for Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix had only been placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of its low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be defective in patients aged over a month with a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ defective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ tic encephal@@ opathy ( brain injury due to high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ opo@@ lies - split into several single @-@ ins to meals - swal@@ lowed up under the food or via a guest @-@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the stomach @-@ blan@@ ket in the stomach hose ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( through the nose into the gastro@@ pod hose ) .
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps not be compared with any other treatment or with placebo ( a hypo@@ medi@@ al medicine , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps also may lead to loss loss , a degra@@ dable acid levels in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , ache , flav@@ ness , flav@@ our@@ age , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleas@@ urable body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Imp@@ act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be prevented from high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ ic levels .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances because of the sel@@ f@@ eness of the condition at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
&quot; the use is inde@@ xed to all patients , in which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ine deficiency have already manifested in the new born age ( within the first 28 living days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fixed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ defect , which is manifested after the first stage of life ) , there is an indication for use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial encephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with slip disorders is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated by taking into account the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; after the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults . &quot;
in patients who suffer from a earliest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly scar@@ ec@@ yl@@ ase is the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² . day required .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency need ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with bul@@ ls , since there is a risk to the emergence of ec@@ o@@ gan@@ tu@@ g@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied with caution in patients with cont@@ emp@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure and with sodium and eco @-@ education associated with caution .
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at about the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; for sub@@ cut@@ aneous medicines of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of the neur@@ onal proliferation and to an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a hesit@@ ating irritation of cerebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain &apos;s growth .
&quot; it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS stood at 56 % of patients at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of those undes@@ irable events have been assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ aci@@ osis , severe hypo@@ critical a@@ emia , peripher@@ al N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a case of an over@@ dose , with a 5 month old little child with a lon@@ ged single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed in a intraven@@ ous administration of doses to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limited neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active connection that is tied to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine contained over the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram it can be produced sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; it is of importance that the diagnosis is being placed at an early stage , and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and clinical result . &quot;
&quot; the prognosis of the earliest condition of the condition with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new borrowed age was almost always inf@@ licted , and the disease also led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and an essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alogy within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; due to ha@@ st@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , prot@@ rac@@ um@@ ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ oc@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ oc@@ ating new @-@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first living @-@ month ) to increase diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy , the survival rates were treated 100 % , but even with these patients the survival rates came with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fixed form of the condition ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ots form of Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tr@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) who were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ mic encephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ izing diet that amounted to 98 % .
&quot; already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is made in liver and kidney ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after offering a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle of hem@@ ost@@ asis and repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous use of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tab@@ le@@ form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable sculpture of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ cli@@ c or hem@@ ost@@ rop@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies was after different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma det@@ ectable .
&quot; for three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single pants ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plastic pipe were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gi@@ fted product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at was treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children that are not yet able to swal@@ low tablets , or patients with lo@@ ops ) or a nose @-@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i or a nose @-@ nose . &quot;
&quot; after the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in plasma should be kept inside the normal range . &quot;
in patients who suffer from a earliest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly scar@@ ec@@ yl@@ ase is the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² . day required .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
if r@@ atten@@ es were exposed in front of the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ a by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of Hirn@@ rin@@ de .
&quot; a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ aci@@ osis , severe hypo@@ critical a@@ emia , peripher@@ al N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight .
on the basis of investigations on the elimination of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram it can be produced sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition . &quot;
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form have been found 15 minutes after taking measurable sculpture of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of life , the patient can preserve the ready product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the big measuring pl@@ spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
if a patient has to get the medication over a probe may be dissolved the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS before use even in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot leave the sti@@ ck@@ eting waste products that can not drain after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you have AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period you are not allowed to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug could skip to the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases also con@@ fu@@ ti@@ ghtness , headaches , taste disorders , descendants of the secret , dis@@ oriented , memory disorders , and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms here , please get in touch with your doctor or the emergency of your hospital &apos;s health care center for the purpose of treatment . &quot;
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or notice side effects which are not specified in this use of use . &quot;
&quot; you are not allowed to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the use of the &quot; &quot; cart@@ on &quot; &quot; and the el@@ ective &quot; &quot; exp@@ iry date &quot; &quot; until the exp@@ iry date of exp@@ iry date . &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , and content of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval form , and they are provided with the &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If you have conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you have AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed over equal lon@@ gs or a stomach @-@ ist@@ ula ( hose , which runs through the abdom@@ inal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( hose which is guided through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • refer you out of the container a dar@@ ed Mess@@ l@@ po@@ on Gran@@ ules . • St@@ oring a straight edge , for example a knife over the upper edge of the brass cut . • the recommended number of spo@@ on spo@@ ons corresponds to a measuring spo@@ on . • check the recommended number of spo@@ on shells from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable anxiety ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ kt ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ aly measuring at the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent cl@@ ots in patients which administered up an PC@@ I , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of PC@@ I .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the first study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all of a certain gift , or in conjunction with a gly@@ ph@@ red @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent cl@@ ots ) with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PC@@ I , patients often became a st@@ ent ( a short tubes left in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without offering GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , coron@@ ary accidents or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; with patients who have subjected to a PC@@ I was An@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators as effective as yeast , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than yeast . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other mil@@ der or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with heavy hypertension or serious kidney disease or cardi@@ ac infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human Physi@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PC@@ I a removable replacement for yeast .
September 2004 divided the European Commission to The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for in@@ transport by An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ lever in@@ far@@ ts ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at an emergency handle or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ al dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ts of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out on a PC@@ I , an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg should be increased to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PC@@ I , after clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PC@@ I consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ ts of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one to be directly connected intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PC@@ I intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be made . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitutional and dil@@ uted medicinal products should be carefully mixed and the bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis will be given rapidly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to PC@@ I ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg to ad@@ minister and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney injury , which included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PC@@ I study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PC@@ I study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , that was included in the ACT 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without a dosage adjustment at the average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see below 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous use of un@@ questionable army or 8 hours following the sub@@ cut@@ aneous acquisition of low @-@ molecular ho@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or other ingredients or against mil@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or mis@@ sible tension disorders . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis
&quot; the patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if at PC@@ I @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din occur most of the bleeding in arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ally , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PC@@ I ) during treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are dis@@ color@@ able and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should consider monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine will once again be reached prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ osis or thro@@ mbo@@ genic aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these substances can increase the risk of blood . &quot;
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ ers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ties are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters in any case regularly control .
&quot; the experimental studies are inadequate in terms of affecting the pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the ab@@ dic@@ ation or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ questionable army par@@ in plus E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group , as well as in the with pi@@ par@@ in @-@ treated compar@@ atively , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more often than in males or younger patients . &quot;
serious bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI standards for heavy blood vessels as defined in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less often than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ prin@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ curr@@ y , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ o@@ cular blood circulation or blood pressure , hem@@ atom@@ a with diameter ≥ 5 cm in the pun@@ ctu@@ ation point , distor@@ tion of the hem@@ ost@@ bell @-@ mirror of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with well @-@ known blood output , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; more , less frequently observed blood loc@@ alization , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ ang@@ , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in 6000 patients who undergo a PC@@ I .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group as well as in those with pi@@ par@@ in @-@ treated compar@@ atively were more common in women and patients over 65 years more often than in males or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects which are not listed above have been reported for extensive use in practice , and are arranged according to system organs ordered in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din will immediately break down and the patient is tigh@@ tly monitoring with regard to signs of a blood . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre as well as at the anim@@ e bin@@ der region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is tied at the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on the one hand divi@@ des the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus creating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;

&quot; with healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dos@@ is@@ - and con@@ centric @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ational effect , which is eviden@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PC@@ I was conducted in the patients , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h increases . &quot;
in the arm A the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered un@@ questionable He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ drom ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever in@@ far@@ ts ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes that need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as permanent in@@ fusion with a insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or which insulin is not effective . &quot;
insulin is quite different to human health and the change means that it works faster and a shorter activity of activity has a short @-@ effective human force .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; type 2 diabetes in which the body insulin is not effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ zed hem@@ ost@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is dis@@ continued .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) is reduced compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted when it comes along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
September 2004 the European Commission distributed the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Germany GmbH to approve A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections , either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the th@@ igh@@ ter or Del@@ contamination , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdom@@ inal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis Cap@@ acity and the dimin@@ ished insulin delivery , the insulin @-@ need can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ization etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw up a change in the insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , particularly in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ able diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis ; these states are potentially threatening . &quot;
switching of a patient to another insulin type or insulin is to be done under strict medical supervision and may make a change to the dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change adaptation of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; to the substances that can increase the blood sugar @-@ sugar activity and reinforce the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ation , pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ hen , s@@ ali@@ cy@@ late and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ ito such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pine the symptoms of ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine counter@@ ten@@ ant can be preserv@@ ated or absent . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ itarian in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin is over@@ thrown into the human milk , but in general , insulin is dealt with either into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to or@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; below are the out of clinical trials known in which undes@@ ired drug users are listed , group@@ ed according to system components and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of availability ) . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to change the injection site within the injection area , can occur in the episode a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be treated by means of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by one trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose absorption , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the urine - cause for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin is lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peri@@ ph@@ ere glucose absorption ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the Hem@@ p of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be done by insulin delivery in the efficiency process faster and the active time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 @-@ diabetes mel@@ li@@ - it showed insulin treatment range from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , a dose of dis@@ proportionate glucose effect , and at 0.@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase in the air @-@ effective effect , just like human . &quot;
Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as a normal human body and achieves the complete au@@ sp@@ y effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human .
&quot; from the data , it is obvious that with an application of insulin c@@ ess@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable to @-@ range gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal pleasure , which will be 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin is spent 2 minutes before the meal , insulin resistance was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal , a better force of force was given to the meal , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin is spent 15 minutes after the meal starts at the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human normal levels , which is given 2 mi@@ xes from the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin treatment in the event 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human consumption that was 30 minutes ( compared to 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) and in comparison to human consumption that was given 2 minutes ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin is given in the gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human standards ) and 2 minutes ( normal - previously ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
