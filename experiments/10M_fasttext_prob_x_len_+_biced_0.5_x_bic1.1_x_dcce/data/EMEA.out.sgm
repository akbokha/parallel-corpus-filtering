<seg id="5">"B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental illness, in which the patient can have some normal episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe general episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased anxiety or behavioural disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution to the inclusion or melting tabletten can be applied in patients where the locks of tablets are difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines, which are just like Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters "i.e. chemical substances, which allow communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitters affect the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing it."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, the re-act of symptoms to prevent, was investigated in three studies over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution has been compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was tested over twelve weeks on 347 patients with Haloperdol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been stabilised to 160 patients, in which the Ottoman symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify were compared."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which lapped to increased unrest, with which by Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the variation of the symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients employed on the treatment of patients."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also conducted trials in order to examine how the body uses the melting tabletten, and the solution to the intrusion."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients that received Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when applying the bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo in four of the five short-time studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re-occur Manical episodes in previously treated patients, and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side-side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extraptic disruptions (infommenities), vomiting, nausea and exhaustion (increased memory production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Humanitarian Impact (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to heavy episodes in patients who had mainly manic episodes, and in which the Ottoman episodes spoke to the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with Ottoman episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder, if a orale therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 divided the European Commission to the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is prescribed for treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new ic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness on doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initialdosis should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4-inductor is reset from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicide behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychotic therapy, also with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increase in patients with bipolar disorder than with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic medicines.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (Myokardincolour or ischaemia diseases, cardiac insufficiency, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure-cutting medicines) or hypertonie (including acoustic and malignite form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies, one year or less persistent, there were occasional reports on the treatment with Aripiprazl ascending Dyskinesia."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if in a case with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a spurdyspinesia occur, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that points to a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, must be eliminated all antipsychotic medicines, including ABILIFY."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore Aripiprazole should be used in patients with varicans in anamnesis, or with states that are associated with varicans."</seg>

<seg id="47">"a weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar Mania, the use of antipsychotic medication, where weight gain is known as side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nerve system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with an overbearing side effects as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-Antagonis Famotidine, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the remains of Aripiprazole, whereby this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy probances increased a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) the Auc of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and therefore similar dosages should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"at CYP2D6 'bad' (=" "poor" ") Metabolisians, the common application can result with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole, compared to CYP2D6 extensible Metabolism."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should predominate the potential risks to the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective Inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteashibitors, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after the crash of the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage should be raised from ABILIFY to the DILIFY before the onset of the companion therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with a moderate increase in Aripiprazolam concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies showed doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl a day with no significant effect on the Metabolism of substrates by CYP2D6 (Dextromethane to / 3-methodology morphinan-ratio), 2C9 (Warmezzol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan). "</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal studies, this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, even with other antipsychotic medicines, patients should be warned of hazardous machines, including power vehicles, to operate, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>
