&quot; to translate the Web site , you can translate into the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Ex@@ tras website . select from the list below for the initial and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated to the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translations are only very rudi@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense . therefore , we do not depend on important decisions without the translation beforehand . &quot;
&quot; only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the bab@@ el@@ fish @-@ page , where you can insert a translated text directly . &quot;
&quot; the package &amp; package includes different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making it easier available . &quot;
more information about the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings extensions .... open the mapping tools and select the required modules there .
&quot; this is a list of standard settings modules from the package box ; add @-@ ons . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system , in case you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base , which includes &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras , you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module An@@ onymous filters ( also called the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Ex@@ tras sei@@ zing filters . with the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M developers in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select a new window with the DO@@ M of the precisely displayed page . as a default , the display begins with the root notes of the document , sample : the element , all other knot@@ s are sub @-@ elements of this root sp@@ leen . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ - and text views so as to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the distinctive feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of portra@@ y folders with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically . tree @-@ maps allow the representation of the size of objects in swal@@ lowed structures . each object is displayed propor@@ tionally to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , large files can be detected , even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , the FS@@ View may be considered a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ emap feature is a rec@@ tan@@ gle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gle navigation and label settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ tan@@ gle which is switched on view color mode , can be either depth for the slight detection of the prescri@@ ptions or figure of another file independent such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if enough space to display is present or whether the surface error appears through restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ emap . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the marking in the rec@@ tan@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; when setting algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . it is frames to prevent the contrac@@ tion of the entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tan@@ gle square is square . &quot;
&quot; as divi@@ ding the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation will be left to us . here it is spl@@ itting for the pen@@ cils and avoidance of space loss due to always advantageous the areas that rec@@ tan@@ gle that rec@@ tan@@ gle that are as square . the best methods in this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal area for an entry over the menu entry point in view . instead , a spac@@ ecraft is drawn into the surface of the super@@ ordinate entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind . &quot;
the module images can be found in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under ex@@ tras picture gallery ... or with c@@ tr@@ l ; I .

one of the most beautiful things on &amp; TH@@ IS came ; is how easy to extend his functionality through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s considerably easier , &amp; digi@@ tization : through writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes made in &amp; digi@@ tization ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change the full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 / c@@ tr@@ l + Shift key + F . &quot;
&quot; that pulling and disc@@ ard images everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree tree , on the horizontal separation line , or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to release the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , films and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields , which is currently being displayed in the tool@@ view . so the filter appears on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when these buttons are displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; sets an organized view on your photo gallery . all photos that were saved on the disc , in which they were recorded on the hard disk , by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after date when the album was first recorded , sorted into the properties of the album . &quot;

the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date sor@@ ting .
&quot; the buttons , average , recently , the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . first , the average of the images is calculated from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first came to an album in &amp; D , the first picture is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; selected to help you remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; When night@@ fall drop quot ; select . additionally , you can set the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wasted .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ts : supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field of mine list . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview display , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you need to wait a short while the th@@ umb@@ nails will be generated . this allows you to avoid , in which you can create new images in the Menu Ex@@ tras All Pre@@ views . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed beneath you . what information this is , you can preview about settings ; select here the albums page and adjust your wishes to your wishes . &quot;
the th@@ umb@@ nails will have help windows . if you let the mouse take a moment resting over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top in the main window shows such a help window .

&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful option to organize your photos and catalog . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual pictures or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this sample or search again . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos that are marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . thereby , you can organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also sc@@ ap parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling is , so you can find the keywords which you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and access key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . besides , the tags are imported to the loss of the database re @-@ imported , once &amp; digi@@ tization : the pictures are noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My map @-@ quot ; or on an existing key@@ word , and then select new key@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word that you have clicked on an existing word , this is the subject of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and del@@ eting . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a sample by moving it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu appears , which gives you the option to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
&quot; you can modify the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the password menu . you can change the name of the sample , and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling . &quot;

&quot; digi@@ tization : put a light in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all the supported image formats , even raw files . &quot;
choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use c@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em ligh@@ table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and open its window . if you &apos;re back in &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window you can open the ligh@@ tically quickly with L ex@@ tras lumin@@ tically .
&quot; from the preview , you can drag the pictures you want to compare in the left or right range of the window and place there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window is to be seen . if you are preview to select from the tool@@ bar and you can also carry them on one of the pictures , so you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to review quickly from a picture series . if you want to navigate with the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to compare it . the right nearby picture is displayed in the right range . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ ders are also working directly from the illumin@@ tic such as F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
&quot; all visual information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both pron@@ ged images in the illumin@@ ant . this makes it easy for example to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of each range you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ voting function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swing the visible area of the image , you must click this to click the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode , both images will show the same image . &quot;
&quot; the zo@@ oming works just as well as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom @-@ regul@@ ator among images or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse to jump in the picture and out into zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures , if you are sne@@ ak in the mode . &quot;
what is a digital inventory - away from the bu@@ zz@@ word ? digital inventory cap@@ tures every part of the process follows after the picture was made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos up@@ takes up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of us does not perform a form of digital inventory . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , remove , group@@ ing , evaluate , review , waiting , waiting and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; digital stock administration takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , secur@@ es , transforming , assembled and exported content which is a mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata are defined as data on data . met@@ adata is provided according to your definition of data that will provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you can find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need to know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have , then you will not use it &amp; digi@@ tization : . the approach to save the met@@ adata both in a database and in the image files guaranteed a very fast search and a safe archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you plan anything in your system , the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you will have to decide whether other access to your photos should be stored or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly via your location . if you are organizing sufficient photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . you will then print a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , working procedures , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work@@ files have and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing simpler . separate new of old files .
separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option to store met@@ adata in the settings page of the met@@ adata page . if you forget it , then you can securely store the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item on the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change what to change ? do not require a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now begin the real work , as you should now select every photo keywords , cap@@ ri@@ vals and a rating . of course , you can select all pictures that need the same attribute and then put the value . they start the best with your review or ranking . this makes sense since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with key@@ word , key@@ boards , as you are often called on other programs or present categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import Catalan images from another source using embedded keywords , then there is no problem and can simply be done by moving of a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keywords will be done by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updated as it pursu@@ es the sau@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata shows itself . this is a very rough representation , as each block of met@@ adata into truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section relates to accus@@ ations or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ises your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let most anybody just look at your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are sure to get interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from a distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that this is the Lan@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical time period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help Him about the motive it has moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to operate only with a label for himself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tization : you can use as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE will even export your images to your wishes into the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web site system . you have to tell the story for the version of the web site . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? well , it was not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already goes with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit the Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already un@@ coun@@ table and will be transported in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future you can be able to open your trips through pictures with geographical references . this shows also the photos on the reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . with the pal@@ p@@ able viewer . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of copyright laws to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the furnishings of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ses came ; as information should be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should be your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as divi@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; title ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the job creation of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independently @-@ commercial photographer . as this is a note on the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled out . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer provides for a news agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency will be given the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against misuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important to them . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . &amp; digi@@ tization : in the near future , such a module will be available for st@@ acking processing . &quot;
&quot; topics : plate errors , plate failure , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , prescribed time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the road or fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section is about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; roll On@@ track , the biggest data @-@ selling company of the world , has some interesting statistics which have a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated this cautious , and you may not last longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also stop CDs and DVDs in archiving . of course there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe it is in your measurable room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording units and use them in the correct way . thus , the best DVD recording units are not much more reliable than the cheapest , but you can write a lot of reliable . so it is about choosing the right choice . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . therefore they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and the control environment . despite this massive protection they are used by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster which causes wonder about CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard@@ disks , flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual layers Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus has almost sixty GB the capacity of a dual @-@ Lay@@ er DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs are of course also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author , and afterwards to a clean , dark drying and in front of animals protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read the media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for itself . your manufactur@@ erg@@ ar@@ ants include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides on this subject a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ appearing study &quot;
&quot; shortly , Dis@@ ks hold the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ing range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . electronic parts of Contro@@ llers are the most common fault of error , SM@@ ART is unable to notice the error . some of SM@@ ART pointed out the immediate im@@ pending accident . these are in particular reading errors and publishing frequency . the expected life @-@ time period is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the whole loss of loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electricity system before you have secured the files , but these losses normally make it possible without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical appliances do not make much of the electric units , the devices are different with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage . therefore , use these anom@@ ali@@ es , hardware design , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects , so protect yourself from the un@@ avoid@@ ably that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed by the energy heat and the rest is grounded . however , it is usually available in the form of a bar @-@ bar . however , remember that not each St@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to which it protects protection against lightning bolt and thus protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of any cable can use to your computer , you should be careful that also all peripher@@ als connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms , as well as through this one over@@ voltage . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the television card . &quot;
if you have a notebook you will need a portable transmission protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for travelling .
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even an exp@@ ir@@ ation of few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection from over@@ tension , these devices can be automatically able to store cordless energy when a black@@ out comes . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concern yourself the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and and compare his security with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality rev@@ amping safety can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you keep in mind about how well your computer protects it . at the end , you should always remember all the cable before you drive into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; you are at home in comparison to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online memory services that is limited to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional variant is not available to you in case of Flickr dramatically . for 25 $ a year you get unlimited memory , which should only be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically deduc@@ ted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a shared memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and drive safely .
the worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission defect has occurred . all these disorders remain un@@ detected until you do one day a photo . nobody seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is much safer than that in your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable network parts are another source of transmission loss since they produce interference within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors on lower level and can be highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in the alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses the requirements and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the notebook and 46 % in job systems . not@@ ebooks is already the proportion of theft 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the Me@@ ists think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; no longer has been sighted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , routes , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem arose , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ en@@ den@@ ces of fundamental physical limitations . it is meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away . &quot;
today cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the final result is more deterior@@ ated . even D@@ SLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; so you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . therefore , make your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make something dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft un@@ gl@@ ücke : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ir@@ ref@@ usal to always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs , into the neighboring house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
full backup : a complete backup of all files will be saved . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
&quot; differentiation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup , generates a complete snapshot of two time points : the full protection and the latest differential . &quot;
incre@@ mental assurance : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time once again . this backup comes from one version@@ ing system next to the exception that it is only sealed and non @-@ continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily configure your machines . unlike the script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmission scripts . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
make important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or another optional medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end , you have completed a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for every month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original reserve , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and met@@ adata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , systems , virtu@@ alization , visual devices , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time period you &apos;re really interested in you , because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you need to consider everything today . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system has been back@@ wards . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the statements in this document . use and apply to open standards which are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means bigger .
let &apos;s assume that you have planning the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ amping , whether your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; S@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; S@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; S@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; S@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ es@@ sel@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is unable to read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is simpler from year to year . &quot;
&quot; G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard of the G@@ IF , but it may be much more . it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can have relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF , but not as many as TI@@ FF . this format we would like to recommend you to store your images . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF has been widely used as a picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss of free compression sal@@ g@@ ges@@ m ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , a problem is required that this format has been adjusted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a free and open @-@ format format that is developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was designed based on the needs of camera form@@ ate . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope to use met@@ adata and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the file for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archi@@ ved the original file , mostly in the raw format , since it saves the met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , it can be said to problems in the link between the met@@ adata and image file and how it is mentioned above . therefore , you should consider whether you are using DN@@ G as a container and place everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , supporting a wide range of applications and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are used on cam@@ er@@ aman , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine editing process , you can use external programs . if you want to edit the pictures again , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut down by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print , etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to add your photos to you . in the section you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import pictures to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; use this with the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom end and the pre@@ viewing pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not appear a preview . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for file order is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side@@ bars features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras don &apos;t have any information available . &quot;
&quot; the met@@ adata displays the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as when using the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or image processing . please note that this met@@ adata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection from all . this will not download all photos of your camera into a single album . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are safe in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired using the standard optional methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you select the photos , you can download the button download and then download it . the button is selected as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
if your camera is supported is an option new download@@ able . these pictures have not been downloaded now yet . in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , the new pictures are downloaded , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons all download or downloaded chosen , a dialog box appears , with which you can download the target album . the list of existing albums will be displayed as normal folders . then select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tization : loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the requested photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete it all at once by del@@ eting the button D@@ elete All . if you just want to delete some , then you have to select it first and delete your del@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility of picking photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should check carefully if the photos were successfully deleted in a &amp; digi@@ tization ; they should be checked carefully before you delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually dischar@@ ged again after the photos are deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the image was taken to integrate into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options on the turning and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ e@@ based sub@@ soil . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options to be done before the photos can be stored on the disk . the first two are related to the author standard in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct the appropriate entries from the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish a different date format than the standard format , you can download for example in the processing field the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % % bonus : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command line . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower case letters . or if you do big letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which is used for a photo , is displayed beneath the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window to the next time . &quot;
&quot; you can read all the information about the orientation of the camera on the timing of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the page side@@ bar Met@@ adata you can read more details about the information you have embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera fails to supply this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the button Er@@ wi@@ ert and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has information about the date when the photo was made available , it may be provided for downloading . all images with the same date are loaded into the same album . not all cameras provide this information . in the page side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can check out which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually off @-@ off , and in this case , it saves &amp; digi@@ tization : the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use this option and select the Dat@@ ums@@ y sau@@ lt at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from her computer to her camera is the button download . select then upload , then select the files optional . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; when the selection is done , it asks , where the pictures come high . select a folder @-@ selection dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to load the up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . therewith , a position is meant to be specified in long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes and which can be displayed on a map . identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ on@@ ate an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can access a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another one , or simply want to document the site , it is good to share the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data get into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and map refer@@ ral . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographic assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recipients . either as a ticket module , or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon D@@ SLR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you need to store these data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format that is supported from the module to geographic assignment .
&quot; there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and from the GPS . on the following page , you can extract the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the hall@@ mark @-@ covered coordinates , which are created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; PK shows no European road@@ maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; if there came so much control over his working procedures as possible . there are many settings to access the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization . to access these settings , you must log into the menu settings . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; to select action , you can preview or launch image processing . thus , they set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . the option is automatically synchron@@ ized in the IP@@ TC fields . also in a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for fibre : this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car box , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the picture of the photo . this does not have to be the author , then these organizations should be entered here as such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be the image below . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions can store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this makes the met@@ adata permanently contained in the picture , and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; these met@@ adata is also available in other programs , and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; ima@@ gery used as an embedded description ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , using the images embedded in the pictures , these can be read through the images , they are over@@ written by the images . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor in the main window over a file , depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; he came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which data types &amp; digi@@ tization is ; indicate , you can add the file exp@@ and@@ ments of this list and remove . however , each file has been created in a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fications , which none of these extensions have been sent ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset , by pressing the kno@@ b right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ tization ; can be switched on this page to the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can use the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over and lower areas of an image can be marked with darker or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this vision mode can be fitted with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ aries than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; using P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since P@@ NG used a loss free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value on high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
with the option TI@@ FF files comp@@ ress you can turn the De@@ fl@@ ate Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ing device for TI@@ FF pictures . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF pictures . it has no effect on the image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss is free .
&quot; with the attitude of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can save loss freely . even if you have written the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ tization , the image processing was just a picture @-@ looking for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation your photos . this dialog allows you to change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard gain is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the picture a little soft , eliminated but the 2@@ x@@ 2 grid patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the whit@@ eboard is used immediately of the camera . otherwise , when the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the whit@@ eboard is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance which was photographed on a white map which is photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ pin images can get more details in four steps more details in the sh@@ re@@ ters . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is to view the sh@@ re@@ ters , so the parts of your images are burned in , due to the in@@ capacity of your camera to view the S@@ po@@ ise . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information in various ro@@ ars . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ ters to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixel generally doesn &apos;t come as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red proportions of the yet saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question , how much colour or wh@@ ites you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ ous value according to your taste . you probably have to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ tization : image processing too . to keep the time for the demo@@ graphics board , you should go conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to obtain a complete picture from the sub @-@ resource data that have many cameras and which is known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ vity .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w came here ; and D@@ cra@@ w have three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Vari@@ able number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm designed by D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour sof@@ tening of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are performed during the raw conver@@ tion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sts ; information such as the color of color is to translate into the others so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color profile Set@@ ting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ts ; examines the folder then during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the blank file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen .
&quot; input profiles should be made to the camera producer and model that you are using . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color mapping or Gam@@ ma@@ correc@@ tions . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not have to perform for conver@@ sions at 16 bit of depth . this means that you must perform the color mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how to print your image from a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated , rather than to rely on the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles comp@@ lies together . this answer is naturally in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image and image processing ; many modules support , which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks , which are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under settings short commands . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ged .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the configuration of the gas@@ h@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper Re@@ regul@@ ates the time between the cap@@ tions , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other landing areas turn off the met@@ adata and are built at the bottom end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show a list of all cameras supported on the left side . on the right above there is a button Autom@@ atic recognition that is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , the portal is properly connected , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , , on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer to put it in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; check out whether or digi@@ ti@@ t came ; the camera automatically recognises . if not , you can set cam@@ am@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this will be shown in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confir@@ m@@ ations for the reloc@@ ating of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can view the convers@@ ation@@ ary of &amp; digi@@ tization ; at the del@@ eting of a photo in an album . at the del@@ eting of a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details . &quot;
editorial changes due to the right side bar may be tac@@ itly through &amp; digi@@ tization ; applied if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you need to apply the changes to the button changes .
&quot; you can also transfer the welcome screen screen from &amp; digi@@ tization ; when starting the start , this acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; D ; &quot;
&quot; the setting off to search for new photos was forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos came ; if something out of the base folder was deleted , you ask if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tization ; used to adjust the main window to your needs . these settings can be selected by settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed : contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correction and improve . image editing can be launched by clicking with the left mouse button , or by the context menu of the preview / Edit menu . &quot;
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in section image editing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current dates number , magnific@@ ation factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar , for quick access to the most common functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing changes your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file store or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file saving .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu File Re@@ produce , or use the button Re@@ produce the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last time . &quot;
virtually every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ re@@ vert by selecting mach@@ ining and recovered by selecting mach@@ ining from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make your keyboard short@@ cut , c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the return and c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ br@@ alt @-@ Z to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB for a moment longer , you will press a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all the actions in between are also revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to store it . &quot;
you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you c@@ tr@@ l ; mou@@ se@@ am or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the box menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : extension factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full@@ screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you want to use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can call this in the dialog dialog box . you can view this from the &amp; digi@@ tization . see this section to setup the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image file and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; pressure dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole phrases . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album , print super@@ visor . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; this window has come ; main window has a si@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available without the navig@@ ational polish , also available in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked on : &quot;
&quot; multi@@ f@@ aches click on the same rider , the side@@ bar can appear or disappear into the edge . &quot;
&quot; in the label Over@@ view , you can enter cap@@ tures with unlimited size or insert . please note the note down . the text is permitted UT@@ F @-@ 8 . this means that all special characters are permitted , so that all special characters are copied in the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can use from other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data support only AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters , and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC description field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after which you have commented , use either the button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tures are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the apply button , there is a button More . with this you can read additional met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , this is always done when you choose a met@@ adata setting , which is always written in the pictures . &quot;
the section rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ting . it can be used either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time please select these and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the co@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
the sampling view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keywords and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is adjusted dynamically to the advertised search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering key@@ word in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the corresponding check@@ box in the tree . all tags of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; select if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the spot , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the full selection , If you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the sampling filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , sampling and view@@ points . if additionally one or more keywords filters are used in the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all the keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected several images in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialogue which you ask if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example shows the main window the pictures on a calendar tag . the sampling filter is on no keywords , what the quantity on three images are reduced . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and then a key@@ word arises from the right spot @-@ tree to the selection and there was a dialogue asking if this key@@ word is set to be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched from settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be one or its , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : the entry that is sought after in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can select for example a collection of all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need the check@@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I found it mainly on &amp; digi@@ tization ; s specific implementation adjusted .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , that is the colours that can actually take photographs from your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , you can reach that the colors available on your monitor those from your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish in the web from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press . unfortunately , colour@@ ing means that you make informed decisions about color administration . in addition , you provide links with deeper information allowing you to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow meets all criteria listed above , you do not have to worry about color administration . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB colour foam . ( further information can be found below )
your only other picture expendi@@ tures are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color foam and make thoughts about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB in comparison with the colors that we can really see below is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color rooms so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click on Info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
&quot; do I have to col@@ t my monitor , if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ? &quot;
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB colour or not , you need to monitor your monitor , since s@@ R@@ GB also closes the circle . if you work as in the color tree of s@@ R@@ GB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool makes five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automatic scanning and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rigi@@ ble Autom@@ atic correction attempt automatically to experiment with your colours the best . you will experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ aire values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its colour shades . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ hered the lumin@@ ous factor of colors of the selected image , so the hist@@ ogram of the Inten@@ sity is as flat as possible . thus , nearly every brightness of the intensi@@ fication is the same number of pixels , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either wonders in a picture or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic scanning : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ hing the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; contrast , this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the widest possible area and a new ji@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the whit@@ eboard from &amp; digi@@ tization : is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the whit@@ ening of a photo .
&quot; the whit@@ eboard correction is limited as over a color foam with 8 @-@ bit per color . in case you can perform too far from the original image . in case you can perform the whit@@ eboard in the blank mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a whit@@ eboard of copyright , which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry colors white preserv@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; the window display can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the destination is adjusted . if you want to see the original view straight away , then it &apos;s enough to click on the window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the brightness of the Pix@@ el under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed as dynamically as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful as you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lighted images , most of the pixels are very small lo@@ umin@@ ous values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ancy . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade of alignment lets you improve the dark details of your photos or down . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature plate . click on this button and then somewhere to use the color temperature of the white comparison . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ el is over@@ exposed .. You will display the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save and loading make exactly this . every setting of the whit@@ eboard you have set you can save in a text file and load later .
&quot; the button pres@@ ets sets all filter values back to their standard values and the associated with neutral white comparison . keep in mind that neutral settings may result in a different photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set here the enco@@ ders per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JP@@ EG @-@ format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this co@@ ding is also needed for high @-@ quality pictures . this co@@ ding is also needed for high @-@ quality photos , data time and is on@@ ly@@ as for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ fil@@ en . color mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the hel@@ per . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be drawn to rate color administration .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors Ton@@ word@@ correction . this tool presents an integrated way to use multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you therefore always need the same correction . in the manual on tape correction , you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful possibility of exposure to correc@@ ting problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization : tool Far@@ ming effects gives you four color effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a channel filter available . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing it was fot@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er . the colored , dark areas seized the sensitive areas darker and the colours replaced by the second illum@@ ination . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar power . at approximately 50 % intensity the picture shows what chem@@ ically is possible . another increase creates a negative picture , that so not to create on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar energy point . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the process works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a sati@@ ation effect that he makes a stronger counter@@ effect that makes the colors brilliant and gl@@ üh@@ ingly . try it simple , he em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one of day@@ light optimised colored film made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ movie . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are , but also some photographs , especially those who have little landscapes , too much . &quot;
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light at the contra@@ sting edge . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . at large pictures the filter can relie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contr@@ ast and change the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are used to use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one to great satur@@ ation . also in this case is the tool for brightness . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool of sound correction to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool seems very complicated , you need for the only section of the shooting . more concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; the window contains an graphs of intention values , a hist@@ ogram , of active c@@ als or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ der into the inside and can be moved to the intensi@@ fication of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and take care of how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand side the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand side are the following options available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification of useful is useful . &quot;
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color @-@ pet@@ als can be used in the preview of the original image in order to automatically rec@@ t the input levels of shade , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ ams : the ex@@ ams permit the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the ex@@ ams , for example , to create a hidden picture as a background while doing something else in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the images are automatically set up depending on the intention of the image of the image . &quot;
&quot; storing and store : these buttons can be stored in the file system , and later loaded again . the Gimp levels are used . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input data is automatically re@@ vered for all shadows , means and Sundays . activate the paint pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the hist@@ ograms for Rot@@ - , green@@ - , blue , and L@@ umin@@ os@@ kan@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ load inde@@ xes controls all color channels to view over@@ sized pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the adjustment of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the ex@@ chan@@ ts are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynamically depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
&quot; modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows the channel to indicate the channel , which is changed from the module : &quot;
&quot; besides this box , two symbols are located between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide beams . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cour@@ thouse to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with darker ex@@ chan@@ gers and which are darker as a pixel . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down , up to the value after your liking . &quot;
save and store : using these buttons you can make exactly this . each turn you have created can hereby be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . file format is the Gimp spa format .
&quot; if you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ ed buttons , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue , and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ curve . &quot;
&quot; the option transl@@ ating Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to indicate over@@ loaded pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the combined effect displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white picture that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous channel . shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of &amp; digi@@ tization : image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
&quot; with the can@@ al@@ box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint about how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and the rash . the original section of the window will display a preview . the original can be viewed as compared with their own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the appropriate colour value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are on the right below : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to change these channels . if you also enable the option mono@@ chro@@ me , as the channel mix@@ er then activate the DAS tool for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ re , the reduction of a color appears to a visible ro@@ wer that does not occur on the same place in the color channel and their spac@@ ecraft is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ re conversion , in which you can reduce the bul@@ ls first . &quot;
the storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender settings can save you for later and then download . the file format is the Gimp @-@ channel bl@@ ender format .
&quot; the option over@@ load inde@@ xes controls all color channels to view over@@ sized pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ activated . the option L@@ umin@@ ancy has been activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / White is a working step , because color images can easily be converted to the computer . also , with a set of film roll@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 2 Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super &quot;
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film covering with a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good at all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against heaven . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
oran@@ ges : sim@@ ulates a black / white film production with a orange juice . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) oran@@ ges . &quot;
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film covering with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can sim@@ ulate the lun@@ ar time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film production with a yellow lime filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones during it adds a bit of cold in the sw@@ amps . this is very similar to the process of a pressure of a pressure and re@@ development in an epi@@ thel@@ ium . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and hence similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization : tools texture you can use decorative textures to an image .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color @-@ painting or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop style portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu entry picture images of the image processing can be used for this . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ak eye . this is a psychological barrier to add the module from image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you put the desired pe@@ er type for your image . elaborate the image with a thin line , low and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , dra@@ ined it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button @-@ making and decorative fits an ornam@@ ental frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range is limited to 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target picture is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ at@@ ted text into a picture on any one place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . the larger the image , the bigger the character code must be . you &apos;ll just choose a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . the image is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text , may be changed until you click the button &apos; OK &apos; . after the picture has been saved once , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool sten@@ cil you can apply a sten@@ cil about an image .
the menu image template uses in the image processing can be used to put sten@@ cils about one image .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compres@@ sing of file size . if you want to add your template , send e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; review ; mail@@ ing@@ list reports came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your template folder with the button ground@@ ing folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noticed for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root @-@ level file has been set for the sten@@ cils , a building concept appears , which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cils . the selection of a folder updates the preview of the sten@@ cils . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magnific@@ ation factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fying the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shr@@ ink : this button res@@ ized the image below . it is centered on the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the full picture , you need to shr@@ ink the picture in accordance with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; shift : use this button to move the image below the template , then take the image and place it at the desired position . &quot;
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted
&amp; digi@@ tization : three different tools available at the edge . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and easy , but , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
&quot; Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works at the contrast of edges to look a picture shar@@ per . actually , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric darkness and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ righted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the dig@@ itali@@ zation process colours with just minimal difference to a color point . this in turn leads to a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually require more bear@@ able sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for private use .
&quot; with JP@@ EG @-@ images , it is often used to use a camera internal field . images in the raw format , however , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner apply a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get useful results by calling a photo with the edge @-@ level of depth . this allows you to check with the menu entry .
&quot; but you should however deal with caution , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of edges , but also ampli@@ fying the noise . in general , the most useful technique is focused on the sharp@@ ness of an image . you can focus on the menu entry over the menu . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ness . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution that picture a little soft to draw is much easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool to measure you with the menu entry . the window display on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help the picture to process . the preview display shows the issue of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the default values frequently generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask too strongly , you will produce noise and the impression of atro@@ cities close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius is a how many pixels on each side of a se@@ te are affected by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore you should raise images best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wis@@ h@@ ingly picture added to the original . this makes the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can thus be applied for a se@@ cul@@ ling of the filters . thus , areas with a soft switch between the sounds are excluded and therefore beautiful error in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ h was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a pig value = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fications came ; tool re@@ focus on a picture by improvement of the sharp@@ ness . it used to be protected by the copyright @-@ protected filter algorithm designed by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to und@@ o a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focus en@@ quot ; this is better approach than trying to raise the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtering . it uses mostly better results than un@@ sharp . you can start it out of the menu by using colours re@@ focus in image editing .
&quot; in practice the circular thread works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical outcome also from the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel , which causes unwanted results in most cases . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular thread . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures the standard value is worth 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very bl@@ ur@@ red then but should pay in Heiligen@@ notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help with ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values nearby 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ens effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filters : an increase in the smoking filter can help you to reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.@@ 1 is rarely helpful . if the smoking filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is the image even further . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . this is most often caused by a pre @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ing filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value equal to zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or smoking filter . &quot;
&quot; note size : this value determines the size of the transformation machine . an increase in the width size can have good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each one re@@ focus parameters you have set , thus can be saved for later and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all the cutting , color and intensive activities on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that lots of operations make changes that are not immediately visible , which leave however later unpleasant ar@@ te@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ cot produce better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused , the un@@ sharp mas@@ cot used to use a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , in@@ sharp mas@@ king always needs to produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filters is often better in arrangement of small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light to the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ator G@@ le@@ te puts the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the scope of the inter@@ tw@@ isted area , in order to create a more natural pose . &quot;
&quot; the color tin@@ ts allows an adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
&quot; the tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool , in order to not remove the arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed . &quot;
the In@@ g algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different preferences as possible points to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below :
in case you want to use the filter settings f@@ og@@ y you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
&quot; detail posture p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a moderate smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should obtain details so that no sharp@@ ness is necessary to be toler@@ ated . please note that the details will always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated by the sense of dependence . &quot;
Ri@@ ding dependency Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a green bas@@ ins or C@@ CD Rau@@ ma will produce a high value of similar patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best suited to a value close to 1 .
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum capacity factor above all else@@ . p defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore put this value matching to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is written larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;@@ Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : returns to how often the algorithm is going through . usually here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ span since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha small is chosen , there should also be small chosen , so make sure that small angle can produce a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral part &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step @-@ span in pixel . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you receive by choosing this option is only minor . but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to allow him to leave .
the buttons Save and loading make exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and later be loaded again .
&quot; image errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load into itself . therefore , you can break the calculation at any time with the button down@@ break . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how graphics can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module will be applied on a photo that in Guatemala city was done with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see , there is a strange retro@@ sp@@ ection during the trip . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization has been a very powerful tool to reduce accounting for accounting . it uses a copy@@ righted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool makes available filters available to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , and can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ i@@ bility ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensor cameras of digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot at the top shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sen@@ sibility . it shows a gran@@ de smoking which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window of advanced settings may remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixels is required , and the image in it is moving over the image and the color in it is smooth , and thus lower mistakes . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the edge @-@ edge . this value sets the pixel out to as@@ hes out the filter changes . if it is increased , noise is deleted . you may need to change the edges filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer be preserved and rob@@ bery or sh@@ ew again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not remove the whole noise or noise tips may occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a f@@ aint smoking or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the ligh@@ thouses of the picture . we recommend you either color or illumin@@ ant to change a picture . these settings do not affect the j@@ ection process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color tolerant of the image . we recommend you either color or ligh@@ ty to change a picture . these settings do not affect the j@@ ection process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which typically are stronger ampli@@ fied . however , he also lubric@@ ates the shadows . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ ures absorption . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filtering radius is responding to variations of the lumin@@ ous density . if it is increased , the edges may appear too high . if he is on his minimum , smoking and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur at edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; storing and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for smoking reduction you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how smokers can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than one image to raise . use the window display on the right side of the dialog box , shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photo ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s , cinem@@ at@@ zer , compres@@ sing , compres@@ sive and local mistakes which occurs in digital , original or retro@@ active digi@@ ti@@ zed images , thereby making the content as it does the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture , and the tex@@ tual correction is performed . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ese and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas it is not perfect , in some areas it creates a few com@@ pres@@ sions &amp; quot ; arti@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these issues . &quot;
the buttons Save and loading make exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can last very long and take a high CPU load into itself . therefore you can break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ shaped noise . the module is applied to a black and white picture that has been included with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film@@ maker on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was applied with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows it to remove hot@@ row from photos showing with a C@@ CD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixel are especially high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem as many cameras have with JP@@ EG compression about a built @-@ in repression of hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ substitution method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the wizard with the button dark picture . the tool will detect the automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to get the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through C@@ CD Def@@ ects .
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically re@@ charge it in the next session . &quot;
the picture section and the preview will help you to correct the result . the preview display shows the issue of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all shapes areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select then the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ arize these pixels . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ation : it will be an average of the neighboring pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels on the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels are pulled by a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block to calculate a bi @-@ quad@@ r@@ atic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to calculate the pixels in block to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
Kub@@ ic : all pixel with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to calculate which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a faul@@ ty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , which is applied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization is a tool for correc@@ ting the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. sub@@ ver@@ ted corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; expan@@ sive objective , especially the middle and large photo format , especially the medium and large photo format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . teleph@@ ones under circumstances also point out this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but it also has disadvantages . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the leaf filter that it is impossible to keep the camera with hand . vast@@ ness objective should , even with center @-@ filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise unconscious effects arise through motion . &quot;
&quot; with the great exposure of today &apos;s filtering and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image which is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fications does not apply to a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ righted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three gl@@ ans , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ correc@@ tive filter and with three more exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light and damp@@ er at the point of the biggest density the filter . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting in a optical filter with a bl@@ en@@ den@@ ting default of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous , contrast and Gamma settings : the editing of an image with the labels correction is dimin@@ ishing the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ vert the exposure of the target image with these options . the regul@@ ator will only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
if you want to better re@@ count the exposure of the target image so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the correc@@ tive correc@@ tions applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ aire and contrast correction is also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses to photos . it uses a copy@@ righted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
&quot; this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour@@ ing distor@@ tions can not be corrected , with this tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des treats the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ical form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar circuit effect , fla@@ p however at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des corrected the distant corners opposite the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; generally , this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second Gra@@ des . with negative values , ton@@ gs may be corrected and positive values of kis@@ sed distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gra@@ des . this value works stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &quot; corners parameter , the opposite sign of the parameter general . &quot;
z@@ oom : this value sc@@ aled the image size new and thus leads a correction first Gra@@ des through . negative values enlarge whilst positive the image shr@@ ink .
brigh@@ ten : this value j@@ us@@ hing the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , illustrated the dialog box with a preview . the values you use for your image will be saved and used next start as standard values . &quot;
the ton@@ ing or kis@@ sed correction should be carried out before all the tri@@ mm@@ ation or size changes . best run this correction as of all the first . if you make a picture new and then perform a ton@@ ed correction would be the effect obvious of the fal@@ sche .
&quot; to help you find the best correction is available to you this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the ocean side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards you can fix the ton@@ ing / kis@@ sed distor@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a kis@@ sing block , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting @-@ tool in the menu trans@@ figured out of the image processing or on the z@@ oom Re@@ gler of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the ton@@ si@@ cal correction is made . the next logical step for some motives such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings it is the perspective to correct the all angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ si@@ cal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate the infr@@ ared film of the G@@ implic@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can adjust two sets of film gra@@ ins and film hyper@@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO rec@@ gler is changing the quantity of the film gra@@ ins and the dominance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; as the filter colour channels to reproduce from infr@@ ared film , particularly the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos , as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared @-@ effect applied to a landscap@@ ed picture from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ utter .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter film@@ maker is a simple tool to reproduce film gra@@ ins on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films rather the manufacturer &apos;s large silver @-@ bas@@ kets of photo@@ grap@@ hing . &quot;
&quot; the film@@ maker effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere released from daily life . if you want to use this specific , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight specifically in your mono@@ chro@@ me photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity can be calibr@@ ated . the standard value is , although frequently higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can use the filters several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gran@@ de effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two ten@@ ders to influence this effect . the top chooses the brush size between one and five out . thicker brus@@ hes are better suited for large pictures . smooth brus@@ hes control the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the magnific@@ ence . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the worked is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filters carbon designation uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coher@@ ent in drawing . therefore , images of their gra@@ dient are slowly changing for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate yourself . this would be good pictures to begin with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the high regul@@ ator chooses the pin size , and the lower j@@ us@@ hered the contrast ( smooth@@ est ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further through adaptation of the Inten@@ sity .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t came ; filters engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ acked in wax , it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t came ; filters engra@@ ving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with a simple structure where color is not the most important on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , monumental landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; wave @-@ bucks 1 : shares the image in cells , and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks . &quot;
wave @-@ bucks 2 : an@@ alogue to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the image here is distorted to a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the kno@@ b button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a piece of artwork using un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ erde lines that eman@@ ates from a centre . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness and creates a dynamic expression of the often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image by rotating the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removing un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; movement @-@ shar@@ pen : caught the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photographs , camera . &quot;
soft illumin@@ ating in@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture soft into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
scar@@ ves : caught the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary mobile camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and caught them without changing it without the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
the regul@@ ators are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righted algorithm .
dro@@ plet size allows to change the size of the drop . as the dri@@ fts size does not grow automatically with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish species changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
&quot; you can take with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing an area free from shel@@ ters . use this option to select the area , such as a face which should remain free of charge . if you start the filter regul@@ ars the area will remain free of reg@@ att@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ iment Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the be@@ amed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu transform@@ ers or trans@@ its mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of picture quality .
&quot; a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharply ? how can you get into a picture , if the limits of dissolution is achieved , here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it on the size size with the tool size . select this transform@@ ational size in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; many imaging programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ tization has been developed ; uses a further developed base . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original size is maintained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is written larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;@@ Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons Save and loading will be used accurately . every inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as text file and later be loaded again .
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it makes , but it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button . &quot;
&quot; you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles , by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare . &quot;
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently run operation , but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture . image processing allows you to simply click the rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the rec@@ tan@@ gle , then you &apos;ll see this rec@@ tan@@ gle while you move the mouse . &quot;
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting area . you can drag the size of the adjacent territory by creating at the corners of the rec@@ tan@@ gle . a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by simply pull it up with the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut@@ out , use the button The cutting @-@ button of the image processing in tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( c@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file file save or file save in the menu file to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the field of view , you can change the size of the rec@@ tan@@ gle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio which you defined in dialogue will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format it is always assigned the bigger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width . &quot;
&quot; cut the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you use cen@@ tim@@ etres , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can also see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialogue , there exist two buttons to the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can set up with the Max . relation to the area to access the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( horizon al or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation . the modified images are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the setting , enable assistance to be bl@@ amed , so that you can put your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of similarity . as the third @-@ level sa@@ ils , harmon@@ ics triangles are a possibility of a rec@@ tan@@ gle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles aimed at the diag@@ onal . &quot;
Golden Mid : the golden middle is a partition which is on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us sn@@ el or the bl@@ ister of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks that use your temples and p@@ yrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers . the divi@@ der divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually followed as visually harmon@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
the golden mid @-@ center presents fluid @-@ lines if you put an image together . these aids are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ level gel the golden spiral also creates a liquid line of the eye along the line of the spiral , creating a sy@@ mmet@@ rical visual river on this type . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfill its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ bun@@ als also lead from the aforementioned golden spiral . its ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . please note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are not a tiny triangles . di@@ agon@@ als appeared on these lines can be released a st@@ ati@@ cal object more dynamic . &quot;
if you use gold triangles to set up your frame create a effect of professional photographers dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry . try your picture focal point at one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al reflect and Ver@@ tik@@ al can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible . on this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things turned around a corner . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select this transform@@ ational free rotation , and j@@ ut the destination angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degree . a preview of the rot@@ ary is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
&quot; to your help , the module free rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse @-@ cursor in the picture above to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , edit the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix it is the function transform@@ ers cutting from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function auto @-@ cutting . select one of the following options :
&quot; the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing the image is a bit after the rotation . please note , however , the above warning . &quot;
all the perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information that can help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that have emerged through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right above : shows the current angle at level at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adju@@ sting the perspective the image becomes a little wasted . for an individual adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after you adjust the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image editing .
&quot; the tool system is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . it is not rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle is turned into a parallel ogram . you can start this module through transform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; add your picture by clicking the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can press horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically simultaneously . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angle is displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed on the right of the preview . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the system tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the lubric@@ ation , the picture is bl@@ ur@@ red a bit . for a single variation this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots generated twice as many and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the p@@ adding the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
&quot; digi@@ tization : there are a number of libraries and other packages to read and write reviews . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on this site . but you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization : displays files in formats only . this happens by file extension , and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can edit this list of file exp@@ and@@ ments ; you can accept this list of file exten@@ tions . in the section configuration you will find more information . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the use format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization : supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compres@@ sive procedures based on digital images . thus , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save in this way the image data on an efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other outcomes than JP@@ EG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the rough format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful guides in English . you can convert rough format pictures in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the Roh@@ ar verter of &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; D . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed : support the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . all support cameras can be viewed below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats published by &amp; digi@@ tization : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this cli@@ ps are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but there &apos;s no film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit . if you click on a movie file . &amp; it &apos;s not enough ; the &amp; k@@ ew ; settings to play movies to play the program for playback .
move forward to the previous album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

&quot; if you exchange steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initi@@ ale contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four steps with the module white . &quot;
many tools that you require the phot@@ oc@@ ating are included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ; their description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft characters , noise oppression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp , un@@ sharp before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture &quot; &quot; texture &quot; &quot; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this advanced beam displays the status of the filter to the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected range .
horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the top section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected range .
ver@@ tically divide . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the top section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ load . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and drop on the part of the picture by which you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all entries from the final use of the module will be noticed .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters during shooting the photo . this data originates from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider is available an intuitive retri@@ bution tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ Program . you can press it with the mouse scroll or hold it and move it . push it while you are filtered to a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course this requires your images to be included in the picture .
&amp; S@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used for editing of color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and naming colors .
&quot; the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and un@@ har@@ med colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog range , you can choose from a list of installed pal@@ ettes or browse the folder to files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the palm view . it can be moved by che@@ wed in the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the palm view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . afterwards , move the mouse at a pressing left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ box type is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode was selected . this mode can setup you by selecting the check@@ box under Bei@@ m cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; and col@@ li@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a poin@@ ter sign , if another color is followed . if so , there are three pi@@ vot@@ al characters in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ li@@ edit ; inserted . &quot;
the colors in the range and the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose one color anywhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left side .
&quot; &amp; Graph@@ ic@@ viewer : is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - programs are free layout programs . graphics are used in science , especially in inform@@ atics . so far there have been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphics &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; Graph@@ ic@@ viewer : project has set itself the goal to replace these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; Graph@@ ic@@ viewer : is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot . the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; Graph@@ ic@@ viewer ; show graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; c@@ utter ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change in the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; representing the graphs re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; Graph@@ ic@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; open up or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
&quot; load of big graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack , to show more than these no@@ des ) &quot;
&quot; further needed software : &amp; Graph@@ ic@@ viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; - program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph . will be required in the individual : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graph , each in an own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; graph@@ ically viewer , the main window will be empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the picture screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is larger than the string . you can select with the context menu a fixed position of this overview or select it automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse bike ( high and down without any special , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum re@@ cl@@ usal of a graph .
&quot; if the file is currently in &amp; graph@@ ic@@ viewer , the loaded file has been changed by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; Graph@@ ic@@ viewer ; can make your decision later just as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings in graph@@ ic@@ viewer , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph@@ ite office outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; -@@ instance , or eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphical viewer , instance or to display the lad@@ ders in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but these can also change with the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later change . &quot;
you can also define how the graph can be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that should come on a page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page show with one on several pages distributed with no head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the page again charging gives the possibility to set the behaviour when a file changed on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the Open provides the option to set the behavior of &amp; graph@@ ically viewer , if a graph outside a current session is opened . you can open a default behavior for that case ( the graphs in a new window will open or determine in a sub@@ window of already running session ) or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site administration gives the opportunity to set up the starting behavior of &amp; graph@@ ically viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( the files of the last meeting or not ) , or decide to be asked at any start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears to have more possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; Graph@@ ics ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; dot @-@ algorithm , the standard for targeted graphs . he produces hierarch@@ ical or polished images of directed graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and possible few c@@ ten@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for invalid graphics . he produces depic@@ tions according to the spr@@ ing@@ case . it is used to the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimension@@ able sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates for ung@@ ing Grap@@ h a jumping field model -@@ layout . it uses the fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold yeast and includes a multi @-@ string for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm puts the knot@@ s circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cy@@ cli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can print a layout command , which then print out by a shell , and the calculated layout of the graph according to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can change &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms specific options , or even the graph with a filter , before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graphs ( directed or invalid ) and uses the standard algorithms for each type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invalid graphics ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview appears if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse cursor . click with this mouse cursor to a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help on this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file &apos;s Ch@@ angel@@ og file .
&amp; Graph@@ ic@@ viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it uses the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; Graph@@ ic@@ viewer ; you will find further options in the Settings menu .
&quot; the main window of the icon editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for string tools , the status bar , the .@@ colour palette , and the grid network in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; created a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will ask if you want to save the changes . then a dialog box in which you can choose if the icon is created from a template , or whether you want to start anew . &quot;
&quot; re@@ vert the last one step back . if you do not have taken a step back , this function is disabled . &quot;
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol of gra@@ y@@ scale . this can produce colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the icon @-@ range of &amp; k@@ de ;
&quot; changes not the symbol , but sets the current character color on the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y coordinates of the current pixels , the size of the current character , the magnific@@ ation factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .

&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module images can be read , tools available to read new images and saving them . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to invite new images to read and saving external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video Stre@@ ams . that &apos;s how you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
&quot; when you scan the menu entry , a dialog box that you can select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the photo . you can also set the source of the source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace your own default values to select your image accordingly . see the preview feature and adjust the area to your needs . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka Manual you will find more information . &quot;
note that the window will be completely displayed as some settings otherwise may not be displayed .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scan , you have to wait until the scan is complete and therefore specify the type of image file . you can also select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image file . &quot;
screen images can be found after you have selected in the menu impor@@ ter &gt; screen@@ shot ... one window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ om@@ o@@ di :
choose the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when all your own program window will be selected , the call program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you &apos;ll be reading the complete desktop file . if you choose the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay up high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot of the screen@@ shot , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above . &quot;

Flickr is an online photo projection on the Internet . with Flickr it is possible to show its photos to the people that are important . you can place your favourite photos of the world that show photos of your cam@@ ah@@ and@@ ys and show your photos safely and private friends and family all over the world .
the module ex@@ porting to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
if you use the module for first time you will use the process of generating a Tok@@ ens . so it is used for your authentication . a browser is started so that you can register with Flickr .
&quot; after successful login , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . you will be presented to the following page after a successful login . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed on Yes you &apos;ll get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section .
&quot; if the module exports to Flickr to the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialogue , which indicates the current access per@@ missions which indicates the module . the module currently also does not require any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button photos should be pressed once you have put all the other options . with this button you can select all the other options . with this button you can select the photos in a file box . if you press the O@@ k button the up@@ loading of the photos to the Flickr server .
the keywords field can be filled with one through Kom@@ ma @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the picture as a keywords during up@@ loading .
&quot; with the options aper@@ ture , friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can adjust the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the option to load the size of photos from the up@@ loading , the photos are changed before the up@@ loading in size . the size is captured from the size of maximum size . &quot;
the Maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio is constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery Export has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image to add and edit . geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ sampling of the picture , and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization makes tools available to locate images geograph@@ ically in the spherical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tu@@ dinal are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as a XML file in the GP@@ X @-@ For@@ mat@@ es. g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alisation Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . of course to run a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a co@@ file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the same time recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file load an automatic correlation , the coordinates are recorded in red . GPS sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded at GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera should be operated with the GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . place your camera zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high vari@@ ance for the GPS time and cam@@ ar@@ quit@@ as . if the devi@@ ation , the data is merged , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have any trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have any appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog &apos;s coordinates are made by a call to the next one , you just have to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ating can also be found with the shown map and gradually found it . select the relevant region and expand it again . the amount must always be selected manually . the map can always be manually altered between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that used the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ tool to add a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML sides .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will enable UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four Reiter where settings can be adjusted . the tab allows all the albums to choose to be exported to HTML . you &apos;ll need to select these albums on the right . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below , the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ schau and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the rider image defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explained . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be displayed on the picture . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard screen , and eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you write your typ@@ ing . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ TE@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , the file size is also affected . all other settings are explic@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the rider Rus@@ th@@ umb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the th@@ umb@@ nails , which are small images to be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; when the module created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore run the program @-@ ups to as@@ certain if errors occurred during the generation . the web browser will start automatically at the end to preview the preview . press Close to lock the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image , Ih@@ n@@ ene allows you to see a selection of pictures and perform at them basic oper@@ ations like rotation , zo@@ oming or p@@ anning . the observer can be used with short @-@ term and mouse clicks . it was designed for fast accounting and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after starting , a picture is shown by default in the screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss @-@ free module is a tool to change pictures without imp@@ airing your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the promotions listed below , to save pictures in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses of quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is it the file size increases , as no compression of color is taking place . for example , you can also find the P@@ NG format for example . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the import function below . then select the file op@@ tionally with which you want to copy the target image . the data will be copied after you hit the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported in writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ ding module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a gas@@ h@@ au .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , using a defined length , using a defined length . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the slides . &quot;
all pictures are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the slides . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you must select the pictures into the MPEG gas@@ h@@ au . afterwards , you can create the module using Ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there , you can also change the images or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image is set . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast with a smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and the path of created file can be set under name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you are going to adjust all settings to your needs , you can go with the button down the generation of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the di@@ ac@@ ock if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the button settings on the right below . &quot;
&quot; the super@@ visor allows multiple images to print on a piece of paper along with standard photographs . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing . this is e.g. , useful to improve you or print a direct expression with the Gimp module . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your recorded pictures in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF , or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original city of Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w , that it creates the same results as the software from your comra@@ de . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first select the RA@@ W file , which is to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w Grap@@ hic window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now re@@ configure the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if camera settings can be used for the whit@@ eboard . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amp can be j@@ us@@ hed . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a quadru@@ ple R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains identical and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged image format , TI@@ FF , retain all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your images frequently , or otherwise you should not otherwise use the JP@@ EG format since it allows only a limited number of operations . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you have JP@@ EG as a storage format , the met@@ adata used in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings you can start using the exec@@ utable button . if you want to break this process again , you can break down this process . &quot;
&quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode for example if you are sure , for example by testing a single image which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to write the existing file automatically . however , this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starter and the tim@@ est@@ amp that is to be used . &quot;
this module can be used to modify the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can shr@@ ink the image or enlarge the image below :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size changes in two dimensions . this aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate dimensions in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is altered at this option .
&quot; printer preparation : preparing the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , boundary size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it &apos;s also possible to change the size of your pictures before . further pictures can be drawn to the list of the images and disc@@ ard it there .
&quot; after which you started the module , the pictures window will be displayed on the pictures selected by you . you can add more pictures to the button below . for the least selected picture a preview is shown on the right . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the button images , the selected pictures will be removed from the list of images . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all pictures , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you have to add only the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to a lot of pictures at once . most E @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sent e @-@ mails . there might be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send lots of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the G@@ mail@@ agent on your computer before . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the choice of comments to a specified file , the comments to the images are assembled in a text file and attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss of free formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , we should use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JP@@ EG -@@ format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under photos file format and add the original files in the JP@@ EG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the modified images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status registr@@ ations , in search of errors , can be seen automatically at the end . with the button Close you can lie this window ? &quot;
&quot; after starting the module further advanced gas@@ h@@ au a window appears with questions like your slides , you can choose between the pictures selected by you and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL on the presentation use very elegant image outputs by OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graph card , as otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the file name will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can manually break it with Es@@ c .
&quot; the option images random@@ ly select that the images are shown in a random order , so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album . &quot;
under delay between the images the temporary distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds meet 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and your chosen access effect . so you should then check out before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can select . random@@ ly select a different effect on each transition between images .
&quot; during the Di@@ ash@@ ore , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and re @-@ launch , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slides . &quot;
&quot; on the left side of the screen , you can view the current data stream , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ tic@@ us currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; photographs , see the picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in group sampling entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have entered information when you look at your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information that look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current screen@@ shots . in the following each one is described . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are shown . by this selection method you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand images to some individual images .
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view with preview pictures to view the pictures of your impact . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save on &amp; photo album ; however , for each person you can save your own image , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined themselves . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button that you want to use right outside the tool@@ bar . in this context , please select which view you can use for the current category . please note that you can display symbols for the current category ( if you have no appropriate pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; you have to specify , however , select which image for each individual person is to be displayed . now you can select an image editor as shown in the picture . here you can adjust the image to the appropriate person . in the drop @-@ in window you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and therefore select which part of the picture is displayed and cut or cut . &quot;
&quot; when you access the entry in the main window , a dialogue will be shown that the dialog for fixing the image properties is very similar . this dialog can look at the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string to the box or description , the cap@@ tures and descriptions of the images searches for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , for example in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ graphies ; if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to try out more functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; photo album ; and check out the fast @-@ speed , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tions videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; photo album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photographed album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu entry . ther@@ eu@@ pon , some example images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ box ; &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as a well @-@ related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays you dat@@ as statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can preview the previous posts preview view out of the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date is displayed in the preview display ) and also displays the current date at the moment shown , when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time line , so the time information is drawn . you can select the selection in the preview view only pictures of this period . you can select the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo album ; provide you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images . one is integrated in &amp; photo album ; the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; photo album ; built in the following part , which you can create about the HTML File menu . &quot;
&quot; before HTML @-@ Pages you need to make some settings . these are split into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following each area is described more accurately . &quot;
first enter the title of the clo@@ cks and a description which the HTML file should be included later . on photo@@ photo album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings .
&quot; next , select whether one &amp; photo album ; -@@ export file is to be created , which is to be seen on the overview page . nutritional information on export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed in the viewer also without description . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , that all pictures are exported to the viewer . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular points . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clearly , which is not specifically taken . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . by doing so , those who support your website and possess a monitor that does not support the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images download e.g. a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewers can change the resolution at any time . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he would like to see a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best to select a basic folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your pictures are saved . this folder is saved and added next time . you can select either a folder or one of K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is displayed all for viewers . if you have created a URL for the spect@@ ator , after the pages have been created , then the URL you need to be here . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files provided by you are still not in the final target folder you need to manually copy them into the final target folder . thus , the import function , see correctly , you need to specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are . &quot;
&quot; the exactly described settings are related to all three on basic directories or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family @-@ party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photographed album ; come together , you might want to add a HTML page to see the pictures , reception , etc . then you have to add a HTML page to view the pictures , reception , etc . then you have to do with &amp; photo album ; this work is not yet to do . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photographs , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file . you can import others into your database . the image features are used with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the pictures are stored in the file or if the images are stored in the file , that you can share all pictures together and can pass this file so independently . however , the obvious downside is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two @-@ fold way . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . the appropriate images are not found , so the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialogue for export of images is described , which you can export via the menu File ... call . &quot;
the most important option for this dialogue is whether it is required to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; for the manual near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atic near the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo album , the images automatically copy for you . &quot;
&quot; if the pictures are normal Zi@@ p files . since most pictures have already been compressed to JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not to comp@@ ress the files , so simply select the export file comp@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; the final option of this page is to limit maximum size . if you want to send your friends images , you might want to limit the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file might not be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture is a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you choose a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... select , will import &amp; photographs , exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you have the category persons of the imported file person@@ er ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you are asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories you comply in your database . &quot;
in the fourth step you can select the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
&quot; it must be easy to browse and look at : if you look at images you often want to view images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will undergo the different steps from ( 1 ) Fest@@ ing the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the search and reputation , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adaptation options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for the administrator of your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; saves all his information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file in the top folder of her images . it is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , to secure a disk or revisions on the CVS where they want . &quot;
&quot; and photo album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and used them automatically . if you want to read a different folder tree with pictures , you can start a different folder tree ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ photo album -@@ c ~ / Company / pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings on photo@@ box , set up ... come to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; in the following section of the user manual , the different settings will be explained . &quot;
&quot; links see six different symbols , with which you can view settings options and options for the viewer . for each setting is a detailed help available , which you can call by key@@ note on the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you describe how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in dialogue options you can set up full members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all groups of a medi@@ ators as explained . &quot;
&quot; see the settings options available to you for the feast of the members . with the above listed list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , there is a list of the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo album ; shares his module with other graphics applications , such as viewing K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can access the module itself . &quot;
&quot; as the modules used by multiple applications will be shared with each other , it can test that the modules are tested using the demo database before placing them on your own pictures app@@ r . demo @-@ database you can check out either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photographed album -@@ demo &lt; / input \ &gt; or through the menu help . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , making it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ box ; do not work . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photographs album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are using their images in albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order of albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo album . &quot;
&quot; thereby sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photographed album ; the current album , which is simple to view the current view , i.e. all the pictures to show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; photo album has to be handed over ; the modules also passed a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photographed album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have specified in the dialog dialog box as a category for virtual albums . therefore , for example , use the category persons , will be &amp; k@@ photographed album ; so do you would have chosen people to view this and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; photo@@ photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of the modules . start the settings dialog and select in the area modules which modules are loaded . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photographed , with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , take a look at the top of a menu option - and a tool@@ bar . below the tool@@ bar you will not see a lot of information , as you can &apos;t see any information about your pictures . in the section we will view this window , then click on the entry image which shows you an overview with all the existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ photo album ; is the possibility to see each picture with notes . this includes information about the people listed on the picture , etc . you can either place each image individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures in Copenhagen were recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for seeking and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in case you can see three lists with a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photographs , as you can always use them again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies in the list of pictures within the list : if you have a family @-@ party and are shown on all 50 paintings that are the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find that the names used upwards are to find and classi@@ fy the people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive a alphabe@@ tical list , please click on the icon for sor@@ ting a date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected pictures and add these pictures with comments . in this case , simply click on the back and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. using the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the application di@@ aphr@@ is it can also add an entry to an existing or new cap@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also record an entry to a category and drop there to this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires you to sort exactly your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the processor by drawing the gro@@ in which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window as well by moving it outside the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the window look to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the button Options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely out completely . if you would like to see this window later , use the button Options ... and then click on the window . you can see this process in the picture . &quot;
&quot; to select the entry images in the browser you get an overview with preview pictures of currently selected paintings , or any images in case you do not have filters . you can configure the size of your images by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it just times . &quot;
&quot; if you get an image on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on an image , this is displayed in the picture pane . if you have not yet opened a window with an overview page , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the picture show . simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete , or select either the remove button , or select in the Edit menu . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for this problem you can find a solution . you can also use &amp; photo album ; namely , pictures can also use anywhere else saved on the hard disk . in the picture you will have to absorb the pictures somewhere else . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo album ; if not all the required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures in which the upper upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however the screen@@ shots are present , so you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the image view . &quot;
&quot; as you can see this feature you need to copy files from the folders and to copy again . if you want to avoid anger , such as the mess burning of your images , please buy a larger disk to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , please filter the pictures so that you may want to see for others and click on Lat@@ est View All pictures that may view your little sister , check @-@ out and select the menu items out of current view . &quot;
&quot; in order to set out which pictures will be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to copy the laptop your little sister , simply select the menu entry . if you want to get the pictures again , click Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set up a password that needs to be entered to un@@ locking the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on one hand , all images on the hard disk and to the other can delete or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only those who are familiar with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; photo@@ photo album ; ad@@ minister and hours over hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at some point . for this reason , &amp; photo album has ; for this reason you can see from the preview , as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the viewer lets you see . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag it with your mouse and adjust them elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available according to a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , the browser will display , see the appropriate entries to this display . so if you click to Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and return by setting the buttons image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and finish . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a di@@ ligence . and then a new image will be controlled by pressing the Str@@ g Taste and Plus and minus . and stopped the di@@ ligence by the buttons c@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
&quot; a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; photo@@ graphies ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can get in the image in and plu@@ gs it out . with the minus button you can easily rec@@ u@@ z@@ oom the Plus key zo@@ oming into the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom rec@@ tan@@ gle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed in . with the equ@@ itable sets the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel is equivalent to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work at videos that in and out z@@ oom with the Plus@@ - and amaz@@ es are key .
with the screen@@ functions from the context menu you can turn the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make notes on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture of a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can watch the watch and configure the configuration dialog of the image to view this name . but you will probably prefer to mark the picture and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you watch one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features , while you look at them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can claim a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in the browser . so you can edit all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use one module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you view the categories in your view view , then you can press features to the picture by simply clicking the letters for the characteristic , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . this case allows you to paint &amp; photographs on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ y your painted later . &quot;
in a picture you can see an image on the painted photo . to turn the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ photo ; to turn the painting from the context menu . to end the painting click on the cross in the tool@@ bar above .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not completely , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire @-@ screen views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple items at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , as all the sub@@ object may already be selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions that appears the following listing menu , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with d@@ ele@@ tion either from the menu bar under editing , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have modified properties , click to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with a bug description . then you can click the input errors and click on the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the furnishings dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed item with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in Fe@@ atur@@ ate view . &quot;
&quot; press a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ ts view and a small example of the scene is cleared up with the chosen texture . as a default setting , the entire texture is rounded , even if you want to have a sub@@ ordinate element ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check out locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera points of the camera . you can draw these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visual range of visibility . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the super@@ ordinate object , or as absolute value . objects are only then displayed when they are selected or their visibility @-@ level of view , smaller or equal to the display of the scene chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are left and the four graphic opinions on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust them to any number . you can also store several windows arrangements , and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or lower edge of a view . a rec@@ tan@@ gle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is embedded in the right hand or left side of this view and extends over the whole height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to classi@@ fy multiple views across one another , drag the An@@ f@@ asser right in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views of clicking on the hill @-@ card in the sight . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are Swedish views : opinions , which are not embedded in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small left @-@ up arrow in the box bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the paint bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are narrow , you can anchor them elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can be stored with View window order ... save , it will be a dialogue in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ amed it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 topical . this version is available in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ der@@ ate the current scene , click on the symbol ren@@ ders The symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry into the scene . &quot;
&quot; a rendering mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can purchase as many Ren@@ der modes , from a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the icon The Ren@@ der settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu view , select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each rendering mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the mapping size , you can enter the width and height of the rounded image . if you only want to ren@@ amed a small area of the image , select the cross section and enter the picture section into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality you can select the properties that uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user &apos;s hand@@ book , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; when a picture is rounded with only one ray per pixel , there are several errors that arise . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ d @-@ effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general you see pictures with this feature better .
if you turn to anti @-@ ali@@ asing and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adapted to the adjacent pixel . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is constantly being distributed and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colors .
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam depending on the pixels . if you adjust the difference between the colors to the adjacent pixel with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the low value on 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 added points will be charged with a low @-@ value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel will be calculated as : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between color values the pre @-@ given threshold , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which will be followed individually and can be checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the low value . &quot;
&quot; another option to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of smoking is called for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn sli@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate one scene with this feature .
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object made . &quot;
&quot; open a new window for viewing the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in dialogue window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported , not yet the full commander of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . when , when , error messages or warnings occur , a dialog window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Be@@ gin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to import the code text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import it to the source text in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply tick the code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert code text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , likewise . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene is ren@@ eg@@ ed . usually this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for the shown object . put the path to your documents and the version . it will be supported by 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example altitude fel@@ lows ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you involve files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tan@@ gle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type label .
&quot; you can adjust the object @-@ catch of the points on the grid menu in the context menu of the wire model . you can set the buttons separately for de@@ port@@ ations , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; greater values arise up a closer wire model and thus a better approach for the shown objects , but require more time for ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball you can adjust the detailed level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the High Detailed view for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , when the camera is using an advanced projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and the sen@@ sing proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach for the proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders . &quot;
if you view a wall there is shown a wall behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess bre@@ w pattern of two adjustable colors .
&quot; when you view soil , a ground below the objects is rounded . the soil is shown in a chess bre@@ w pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate channel satur@@ ation , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ ders of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Ren@@ der modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window , you will be able to create and save window formations . &quot;
the Com@@ mentary field Standard window order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
&quot; the list available window formations displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot;
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name indicates all the views of the chosen window order . new views can be created with the button adding and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with uninterrupted anchor you will receive a postcard view common with the previous view and sk@@ ating firmly anchored the view not in the main window , but creates a clou@@ dy window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : installed and now you would like to follow the exact knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate simple scene , under beginners very popular : a sphere at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you keep yourself aware that you as a result can only be given a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
&quot; when you have installed anything error @-@ free , see the first Start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the following window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you have a scene with no objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene which you generate . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ment of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view properties tab in which the various parameters of the camera are found . in the user &apos;s documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , please find more details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing about the basic settings of the camera , this is later guid@@ ances reserved , but note that the camera can change the camera with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you apply the button or press the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehensible method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; in fact offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and press the button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model now shows the plain , albeit at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level is stretched to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can click the entry for the ground if you click on the icon + before the object . in this case you will find the various parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the various parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the various parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shifting . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise an unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Dis@@ placement and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something different at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue in which you can choose to choose how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object tree ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you can look like the pig@@ ment now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments shows only a fat black material because you can check settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you can always check the colors for the pig@@ ment . please give now the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities now , but now take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see color on the he@@ aders and ball in the preview , then click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is right now . if you are using your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color scheme . you need to enter two new attributes here . then select this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board colour can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
select in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; this step should you already be able to carry out , as you should have understood the fundamental functioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just as easy to create as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in view of lenses you can instantly change the settings . put the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button ) , so the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground to a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ ders are now a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step an appropriate material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already with the ground , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select the bottom object and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then select one @-@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more exciting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click on it or press the input button .
&quot; the settings gl@@ oss and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if met@@ allic : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you can offer you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have already learned so much , that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tracing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you use a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ e@@ tic , the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that the scenes are reflected and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects are , such as m@@ ist . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simple black . obviously , every scene needs to be rounded , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already stored the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space . &quot;
the scene has been re @-@ stored in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
this menu entry can only then select if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeated the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only then select if you used mach@@ ining .
&quot; saves the current window order , and opens a dialog in which you can input a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cut and the standard behaviour . &quot;

&quot; a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to put off @-@ out surfaces , without having to model every b@@ ump on the surface separately and without change the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these root bodies . these models are then further edited to give them a realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base using an image file as a color card .
&quot; &amp; cu@@ ff show ; is a comfortable image and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display . &quot;
pictures can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; cu@@ ff show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key returns .
&quot; you can set whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are always to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply tap the first characters of the file in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the lower right corner . if an appropriate fil@@ en@@ ame will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box - &amp; cu@@ ff show ; there are five car@@ ats cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; cu@@ ff show ; set in the two other , short commands for the display window and short @-@ commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut can be specified for the particular window . &quot;
&quot; if the picture is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can further down . default mode is not a full@@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; if this point is activated , loads &amp; cu@@ ff show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; cu@@ ff show ; when checking the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; cu@@ ff show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the coloured beams to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can create &amp; cu@@ ff show ; to set up that only some of the file types will be shown that the program can represent .
&quot; with this option , the display window is increased to the full screen for large images . this option is switched as a default setting . &quot;
determine if the sli@@ deshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time period between the picture changes in a sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or the sli@@ der and the small arrows right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ ps . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated as long as it is thrown down by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or the narrow arrows on the right side next to the input field . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; cu@@ ff show ; in the car@@ dinal maps short rest for the display window and short @-@ commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the partial view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;

&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; features a si@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions to the selected pictures . you can also view this page in the image editing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five Reiter : &quot;
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images , which no longer makes images to scan and saving . &quot;
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes pictures to scan and saving . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save a dialog to store or store the pictures immediately in a specified folder , using automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a default scanner can be set at the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not open or if no default scanner is displayed then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
the user can select the usable scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) treated these options not particularly .
&quot; to make a picture , the user can only launch a pre@@ amplifier and then start scanning area for the final scan . the pre @-@ sh@@ out can be started using the preview &apos; button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better the user can get into the image and out of the current selection , it can also adjust the z@@ oom so that the complete preview is fit into the window . &quot;
if the picture is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when before saving a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a window display , as shown below , then the image is stored and s@@ lie ? en leads to a break and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the same @-@ named dialogue will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user may view the picture if desired , prior to saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be shortened . &quot;
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ ill@@ ite ; pictures to save for each image opens the dialog in front of each picture @-@ called picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically generated with a generated name in a previously defined folder . then you must save saving without having to ask for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved at the option saving without having a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as a standard for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically generated images and moreover , the proposed name for the image in dialogue to store . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
&quot; the user can adapt the quality of image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button above starts the K@@ DE -@@ Dialogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to quit .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of this p@@ ump@@ zel and their function . below you can set up a list of the keyboard short@@ cut by clicking with the right mouse button into the Player window and set the short@@ commands ... select .
you may need to set existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; make your keyboard on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , players , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function could be called &amp; eg ; to look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the line @-@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has still some own command @-@ lines options .
&quot; you should give the user an feedback if the script can not be executed because of missing dependence . please check in your script , whether all required modules are present and make use of dialog , so that the user does not run . &quot;
&quot; b@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is , for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit &quot;
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or just add them to the required features . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and ste@@ er Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included every K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable the output of external programs and commands . this is usually used the function ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to call . here an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , scripts are constantly monitored and react accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
configure We@@ is the script to view the furnishings dialog . to store the store and loading of the furnishings required to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the work@@ ing@@ folder to the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script might now ask for example ; with D@@ COP functions other information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the plot ) .
volum@@ et@@ volum@@ et@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change of volume . the new volume is an integer of 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ pped : sub@@ menu or Tit@@ le to use the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be specified . to get an entry back to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu one Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to pass , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed so as to store data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ v ) which can be optional with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) which can be optional with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) that the user can see the archive clearly as Amar@@ o@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ ded amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should call your script package right properly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) which should not be exec@@ utable ( + x ) which should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
&quot; when your script is finished , you can go up on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attach it to your listing on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; Skri@@ ll . &quot;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screen photos .
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok requires only the package of K@@ delicate and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have packages , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile K@@ delicate . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the OS@@ D set ahead that your window manager will work the relevant standards of free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . G@@ NO@@ ME will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will help for example difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files brings an error in the Tag@@ lip library . you can find the file out by ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ ged file . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the file again . &quot;
&quot; mostly , this is because Tag@@ lib cras@@ hes out of this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ us developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
make sure to compile all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ lip but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled this then results in mach@@ ining the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable machine . switch off if in@@ active for ... in the adjustment of the sound system , or at least do not use any value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by email ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in a crash ) . if it is a common back@@ trace , the bug will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many of the program write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 to met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) can be easily forgotten in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol@@ ism is simply forgotten . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting displays their effect .
if you get this mistake : amar@@ ok@@ app : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon C@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map . then please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ One amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;@@ _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ fying Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf such that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most inst@@ ays can be resolved easily by the help of an expert your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or with developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one mistake if you find something on the rec@@ tification of a mistake in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears a blank playlist . how do tunes get there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ window into the statistics window was converted . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist the assessment column ; click on the title bar of the playlist and select column show . you can also use the short@@ listed Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this works also if Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background .
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and select from playlist remove from the folding menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist , and let them fall there , just as you would make it with other files . so simple is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , the button is to be saved . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program is missing x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config and install the package from x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look for li@@ b@@ vans , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition you can find it via the menu bar under Ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question is What media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every conceivable audio format .

&quot; if you use the driver driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device needs a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix -@@ module for al@@ sa to be reached ( software mix@@ er ) . take a look at the assistance @-@ mix for al@@ sa . &quot;
the output of this command should help you in search of the problems of mur@@ ders and a solution . you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ sal ) .
&quot; this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media should first be de@@ code first . G@@ spre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also enco@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to Al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the enlar@@ ging of the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your al@@ sa furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ spre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ glia so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimised ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less entries are responding to the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . execute G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( end Amar@@ ok beforehand ! ) : - Download it ff@@ m@@ peg down , compile and install it . then you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; if you have a full list of suggestions and wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Classic field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks D@@ COP , this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will wo@@ ken by the soft sounds of the music that you have stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how can I stay up to date in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ongoing title is when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p -- user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing &quot;
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and user name with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA file .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window will be separated . press this on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size changing windows . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button puts a piece in the queue in queue in queue . by pressing the input key following a search in the playlist the first search result is played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the Player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the control panel ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after starting Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console , many error messages appear . &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ k@@ s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD , then click in the menu on audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to normal terms , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destinations in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , please take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ C@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ string ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM Statisti@@ cs &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; ) . &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a declining value , based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence has the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece of yourself by clicking with the right mouse button in the play@@ lists window . then mark the evaluation of a piece , just like all the other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and press Edit : evaluation or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the dialog met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to show you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan , which did not match the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users can easily find annoying . disable the option icon when playing animated anim@@ ating in general settings . &quot;
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool to set up and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on new design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties .
&quot; con@@ sign@@ ors navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok , while you are on the Kon@@ qu@@ or brow@@ ses . then start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click on the button Settings ( the top one ) and select in the folding menu addition to Amar@@ ok ; &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information that can be played on an independent server . service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; if you would like to use al@@ sa , please use the latest available version . old al@@ sa versions have a lot of cras@@ hes and also caused a lot of error reports . &quot;
presumably &amp; Amar@@ ok was probably installed before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer installed . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you have to configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably , use a distribution which is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ spre@@ amer are installed , the necessary developer files are installed . you must now install the package de@@ vel @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need &amp; Amar@@ ok again . &quot;
I consider the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos;s ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ays , which is incompatible with fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS , if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I consider the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ stre@@ amer , the module must be installed g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system manager G@@ ST register . then you start Amar@@ ok anew . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use al@@ sa . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
under settings Amar@@ ok setup ... audio @-@ output give the device a . typical is Z. B. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ x 8@@ x@@ 0 for type plug @-@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ Cr@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug @-@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ sm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; type in the furnishings from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio one , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound@@ card . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you may want to take this problem naturally even into your hand ! if you would like , you can use the new so much needed staff for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; to listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the furnis@@ hing assistants that would like to update your collection , or the wizard simply do not like , then this quick start @-@ guide will be a help . with their help you will have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes . &quot;

&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that exist in no other player . but do not deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be split into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context @-@ browser . on the right hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users are powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser design . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ters . these three sub@@ windows are later still applied to detail . they provide information on current piece of different aspects . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; perhaps , you might have noticed that the sub@@ window will be taken away . the information presented here are now collected in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; moreover , the information in the Statisti@@ cal window will be collected ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the just current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this window will display information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpre@@ ters and the album . below , you see the cover image of the album and next to a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to trace the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you see here , how often and when the piece has been played for the first and last time , as well as its rating . &quot;
&quot; to view cover pictures in the context @-@ browser displays the cover images in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context @-@ browser is also displayed cover images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or are embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Emp@@ ty pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will immediately be played . &quot;
among the recommended pieces you will find the favourite pieces of this interpre@@ ters . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the interpre@@ ter .
you can set what information is to be displayed in the music window . click with the right mouse button somewhere into the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of interpre@@ ters , lists all the albums of the current interpre@@ ters that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the contents of the album . &quot;
&quot; you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start immediately with the playback . you can also click on the right mouse button , and then select one of the possibilities for adding the piece or album to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window text the downloaded text is displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text by even written scripts written from other web pages . if you click on the text box , you can download the text for the piece out of the Internet . if there is still no text script , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
&quot; the button Edit allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database is stored , no run text is necessary . &quot;
the button Search opens up a search on Stu@@ d for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ters - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is shown directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or genres are not om@@ itted . &quot;
&quot; group interpre@@ ters / Album - First the pieces according to interpre@@ ter , and among them will see another division according to the respective album . if you want to see composition or soundtrack @-@ albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group interpre@@ ters / year - Album - Sor@@ ted to interpre@@ ter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - Alb@@ um name is used . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpre@@ ter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces will be displayed first according to genre and under the interpre@@ ter .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / Album - This setting works just like the above , but in addition to album below the interpre@@ ter is sorted . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing completely after exposure . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; your collection will automatically capture the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in the building view . information about the use of this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection field , with which help you can filter out the last 24 hours up to a year . of course , you can also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection @-@ browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
download - This lets the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order into playing .
hang on playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .

met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) shift files into the tr@@ ash@@ can ... - opens a confir@@ ming dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under Differ@@ ent interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; assemb@@ ling markings - changes a compilation of the album back into a normal album . the album is no longer displayed under certain interpre@@ ters , but again under the interpre@@ ters . &quot;
the play@@ lists @-@ browser is easy to use with many play@@ lists . among other things he also includes Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the intelligent play@@ lists are composed of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; also , Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialogue to create a new intelligence playlist . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , you must be involved in front of the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ ter sorted in the upper list of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer songs to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them drop them on the list . if the transfer is finished , stop &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; and solve the disk connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area that allows you to search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all the files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , a address bar , with which you can input music from an ordered URL . if you are entering or press music : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz will be able to access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be helpful in a simple case . in the case the Fes@@ th@@ old of the Shift key can be helpful : this will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouth . &quot;
&quot; the playlist sticks all of you to play on the pieces . you can enter the order by entering the entries either with the mouse . as soon as you enter the letters , only the pieces are displayed . to reset the filter , push the back as long as the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter into separate search terms , you will find &amp; Amar@@ ok ; according to entries , search for all searches . if you type in one two three , the search will find all entries that are one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; if you enter between the search terms , it is sought after entries , either one or the other phrase . example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries , the spaces contain , then join the search term with geese : Mike Old@@ field . thus , according to entries , Mike Classic field is sought , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Classic field . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you specify a particular search page , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : review : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain phrase , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something seeks to pieces , which does not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syn@@ tax options after exposure . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all pieces that have either Mike Classic field or have a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the string key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired sequence to the entries . then the entries will then be shown with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left side you can add the button to add pieces . to the right next , you will find playlist , empty and random@@ ly M@@ c . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow back@@ wards and re @-@ establish . so you can und@@ re@@ vert changes to the playlist . &quot;

fills your playlist with random pieces from your whole collection and adds further random pieces during the playback .
inser@@ ts pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) added . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile with it that this dynamic playlist works .
&quot; click on the desired playlist , drag them into the play@@ lists window or click on it . this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist under circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two consecutive modes of random mix and play@@ lists fill instantly your playlist , and you can add playback to the playlist . the recommended pieces will be added with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece of yourself from your collection . therefore , your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . over the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again . &quot;
&quot; the new playlist will fill the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . playlist will edit the dialog by the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to the editing of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this attitude is not active , your playlist will be continuously growing , the setting for coming pieces will be passed and they will not be heard in this playlist , but if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under consideration the p@@ iel@@ ded pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see what pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece by playlist . if you adjust here more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialogue , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the inter@@ cep@@ ted play@@ lists are added . &quot;
&quot; some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize settings by setting the script and then click on setup . &quot;
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts installed by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry in the list will be installed . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button more scripts . &quot;

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for the audio code flow . O@@ GG precautions benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis De@@ ko@@ der@@ - and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio and MPEG 2.5 . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers layers I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder . &quot;
&quot; ame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial ends . L@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ En@@ coder module . &quot;
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C deco@@ ders and the external audio @-@ en@@ coder module so that you can read FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Muse@@ pack Dec@@ or : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is for example possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn it on an audio CD . &quot;
so@@ x : an aid program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for the video review . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the function@@ alities of fully equipped authors to manipulate , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful for creating a pur@@ ée CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording of the different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces can be re @-@ reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved once , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown , with which you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file . &quot;
stores all the opened projects . this is the same as if you want to save for every single project file .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project changes and has not been saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what is supposed to happen . you can then switch between store and changes . moreover , you can also break the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project to ask what is supposed to happen , just as if you could have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not saved project is asked , what should happen to it , as if you called the file . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select over the existing dialog files for adding to the project . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is it ? ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it prompted us to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful for you , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files already existing on the medium . &quot;
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature set up &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium ; it only ends the previously imported files .
&quot; open the CD Cop@@ y dialog box . this also allows you to create a CD on another medium without project file , which you can then burn sometime later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cas@@ ens instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should also need cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opening the DVD copy dialog box . this also allows you to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . furthermore , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . therefore , the target medium must be large enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . thus , you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing @-@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burning a previously recorded CD @-@ image . the dialogue asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning an earlier DVD image . the dialogue asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which then can be burned out immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window can be converted . this dialog window is usually used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used all @-@ standing . it contains information about the illuminated video , enco@@ ding settings and even options for changing the size and cut black margins . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the random medium . this information is represented in the content view and include characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is attached , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is enabled , a small hole at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not inter@@ crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view switches or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locks , and un@@ locking the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view turns out or out . the content view allows to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; divi@@ des the head @-@ box in the project view one or out . the cop@@ h@@ list is a nar@@ ro@@ wer range that only visible when the project view is not real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog window for changing the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furniture assistant . thus , the correct authorisation can be adjusted to burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administration rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system manager ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here general programs can be made . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on place . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alize and for the refinement of the program .
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function@@ all@@ ity , therefore it is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial to specify which the included programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP , you must be sure to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP , all of them have in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP interface between &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;

&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; - read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be saved audio CD ; s out and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the machine .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface between c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; -@@ data in W@@ AV files on the hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders who are currently installed ( compressed ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD is read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( loss free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these W@@ AV files ( usually one per titles ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format , or also other formats such as loss @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia used . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package . if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ es ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it is most likely not necessary to compile something itself . however , it is probably not necessary to compile something itself . however , if FLA@@ C is not needed , the installation is also not required . &quot;
&quot; which Ko@@ di@@ tor / file format will be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ tor gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not provided to avoid any copying protection . in any case , &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting only needs to be made ( the furniture dialog ) , however , can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , will be explained after the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble in the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which cooking programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can I collect &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , using everything manually . &quot;
this is just a brief list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step example there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case , first the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start the Read and - if an En@@ coder is configured in the Cre@@ di@@ erungs@@ Settings &quot; tab - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of the available en@@ coder , so that the selection with another en@@ coder can be read as the standard . it is to note that previously the En@@ coder is configured in the furnis@@ hing settings in the furnishings dialog . &quot;
&quot; open the file manager , so that an already illuminated file will be selected instead of enco@@ ding a full &amp; CD ; un@@ locking and co@@ ding . &quot;
opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pie@@ p@@ ses ) for programme events ( how to read the &amp; CD ; end ) . &quot;
opens the main con@@ vocation dialog by &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various mapping cards ( like En@@ coder to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choosing the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss of audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial equipment that can be recovered . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , which will lose information through data compressed depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be provided with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license issues &quot;
+ high up to very high ton@@ ed quality ( high bit@@ rate ) but compared to O@@ GG easily deep@@ ened quality in deeper bitter@@ ness .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or machine @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car @-@ stereo installations . today - initially 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and from the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compres@@ sive rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs more and more 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all the pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and autoimmune systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is inserted manually or through the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file name , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with code programs , there is often a combination of programs for the co @-@ dict@@ ator and these parameters here . the manual or help to the co@@ di@@ ers declare the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks so out : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs to download / enter the information , so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the calcul@@ ator . it is to note that here is only written by text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc . , not of the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ no@@ m of the U@@ e ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there &apos;s no more or less worth@@ less so that neither the artist nor the CD / CD ; there &apos;s no more or less worth@@ less so that any information may be damaged at a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physically , or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively used to choose a check box ( Send a address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address as being used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used by the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; used to use free@@ DB , the geograph@@ ically is needed at the next lying mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org supplies a current list of reflections for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the read of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which sample program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that it is used c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to save the loaded W@@ AV files , the code can be chosen and therefore the desired file format . at first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss of free compression for audio data ) on the tab to setup of the code . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ tor package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ fare Co@@ di@@ tor .
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a conversion window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check out the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , writing and read@@ ings for your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read an un@@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , read everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux @-@ distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine because it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have scre@@ ams to it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something could probably only be done once and
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for every aus@@ ing &amp; CD ; &quot;
here we determine the used enco@@ ders to compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resul@@ tant sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy to use the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely don &apos;t change with any one &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is provided to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; frequently / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or when more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , so the device can be accessed using other programs , thus helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the Kar@@ tei@@ card General settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not have much to do . here you can be defined a additional transformation . in our example everything will be shown / inserted as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; only Please select with incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information is missing to the decree of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the Kar@@ tei@@ card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
&quot; note : the machine must be connected to read the &amp; CD , connected to the Internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately begins the read of the &amp; CD ; it &apos;s associated with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be modified . the directory / fil@@ en@@ ame will be modified and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; day @-@ day . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , you will continue to note : if you want to manually enter everything you need . you can use free@@ DB locally in offline mode , check out this twice if this is worthwhile . to free@@ DB in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following car@@ b card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a reflection @-@ server nearby . on this way , the load between the machines will be distributed . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function also in terms of the server , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ oms the protocol 87@@ 80 default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first landing stage should de@@ activate . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp is available on your machine )
&quot; number simultaneously out@@ going pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and co@@ ding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are specified this one , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the W@@ AV files is available . if the box is not attached , the files will not be loaded in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; everything just input as it is shown on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something must be made to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest like in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; the number of W@@ AV files at the same time : with a duplex , or even a multi @-@ processor machine , it is possible to co@@ ding more than one W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section will be described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will pick up MP3 files , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will have to pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for every going &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , see the screen@@ shots a little different from the data used for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of taking it from the Internet . comments are addressed to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this Hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , then the &amp; CD has to be defined now ; in the drive , which has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , just as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD , could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not happen then you are searching for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that your opinion best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not selected the check@@ box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , you may need the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen@@ shot photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; the artist does not have to be entered into the input field &quot; &quot; Update title &quot; &quot; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments ini@@ qui@@ ally per piece ; the comment @-@ field of the album is used for comments which apply to all the pieces of the CD .
&quot; attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , it contains already the data as shown in the next screen@@ shot . however , it &apos;s always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you do not just start with the artist &apos;s and album name ( e.g. if all words with large letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 @-@ tags , you have unlimited field @-@ length , at least on what &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; tab . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ tor to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which obviously matches the style of the out@@ going CD ; in this example , this is not important as we transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the boxes for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . just enter the entries for the boxes of the current piece . just enter the title of the piece for each case and other information you want . &quot;
click the next line in the main window and process the same way until you entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . notice that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
note that there are a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece one or out . make sure that all pieces are selected or add the button all the pieces on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection out of the readable process , this window appears to confirm . OK , and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider orders for switching on the order window . it is in the upper upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower left of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ tor you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example . have you checked whether you write writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this makes it possible to read and co@@ ding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration setting to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing can be configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes to read and co@@ ding . in case of performance machines the result is unclear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem simultaneously reading and co@@ ding ( but two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the body . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is used today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the dem@@ ul@@ ulti@@ media package . if you are already using CVS , there is already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you have probably done it already ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals who compile source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adjusted to your needs when it is run once , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different other programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows the images of the different mapping maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first start of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program boot no audio CD ; on the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu . &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you always want to add something useful or want to change it , may it do it . at least only after contacting the author . and if you read this , he did this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely though it has been able to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; Car@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Car@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has not have some features with Ech@@ tz@@ gra@@ fic@@ k and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ Ech@@ ol@@ le@@ ft@@ ment of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&quot; &amp; P@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; D ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ oun@@ t project driver , which is needed for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it is a Sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window on KM@@ id can draw .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( songs or text events ) . KM@@ id automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; seat support . if you are &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , KM@@ id starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , awe , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; mid @-@ window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and enter the kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar , select the entry section out of the menu piece , or enter the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; mid @-@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; mid @-@ window . ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played in succession . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ She@@ et and so change the speed @-@ speed . to get back the original pace , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , thus breaks the reproduction while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the reproduction . &quot;
&quot; Lie@@ d@@ texts can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song ly@@ ter@@ nis and some other both . some pieces have no text at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the E@@ ign@@ ist@@ type will automatically be determined that you have chosen a song , so you have not selected the kar@@ a@@ oke text automatically . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a fixed type , select from the menu settings the entries of text events or song@@ writers . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . in this section you will be able to use your collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . this will be found in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the beginning the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the only one in the collection manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . concern yourself if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the kno@@ b . again , the file dialog box , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automation addition to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece at opening ( using file opening or drag and drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
when Autom@@ atic Add to the collection is not enabled in the opening of a piece the temporary collection is activated and accomplished . this collection will then continue to add pieces .
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row from the menu @-@ menu items of the menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or select or remove random order in the menu , the order will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selective list over the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to further jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece , or push the arrow arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu piece , or push the arrow arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection , select the collection and click the button D@@ elete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events translated into events that understands the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which turns all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always makes a trumpet sound , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file containing all required compositions for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . however , is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of an interface is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the gender equality is ignored . it is believed that the GM patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also don &apos;t get a line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds , which this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M . if your key@@ board , for example , do not support a gun ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which is similar to a gun ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which is similar to a gun , and add the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so , if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drums on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound in the MIDI file is available . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant by which each tone represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ed instrument ( drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound represents the pitch @-@ height of the always the same drum ( as some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the per@@ k@@ eling canal . take a look at the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel you can simply do this in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a certain channel ( general MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section therefore has 16 lines , numbered between 0 to 15 , built according to the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the channel is displayed on the channel . if you use the key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will naturally use the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , then patch is used . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ patch can be used for example to always use the Per@@ k@@ eling patch on the Per@@ k@@ eling Channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates , in which relation to Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event will be multiplied . if a MIDI file is calculated with the value , this will be used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file does not stand a dec@@ im@@ al code ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends to play a key@@ boards that is a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards reach two sounds up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole row Kla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ atures you can see which sounds are played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is an exit list , where you can choose an instrument , the button shines no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view has ( until now ) two different views to indicate the played notes . the view check in the menu settings below the point can@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow@@ down it down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . it can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians playing the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anyone to force &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file need 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the different instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; that can happen if you have a Bin@@ sch@@ distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) of &amp; col@@ mid ; have it happened because &amp; col@@ mid ; without exhau@@ sting support . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; do not agree to support &amp; mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; mid @-@ window . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable the setting of automation to add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can click the arrow key to the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the reproduction . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD screens .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop I have to play if the collection is finished at the end or I want to play a file only in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; drag the file to the window of &amp; mid .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file easily , you switch to the collection to a collection , turn off the setting of automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to a temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. you just want to play the first file . so make the setting of automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then decide to play also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me the , further on &amp; mid @-@ program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez . I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ zur@@ y ; Lag@@ a . at the moment , I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies but I try to collect myself a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files make music make and phrases . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want to make a question of an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ kis@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard , or a MIDI file , if you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might have the file . &quot;
I have &amp; mid @-@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and nobody smells of it . I would like to emphasize that I can only do more programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends much on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an awe @-@ card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; c@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files used by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playing DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ r ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional assistance , please check out the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . and finally there is a window window , which only appears if information is to be displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s possible to get the prefer@@ ential connections under the menu book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , so you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an extra hierarch@@ ical clock . if you view an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the attached entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist may also be changed by direct editing of XML files . of course you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; do not run through an editor , but also by application itself . simply click on a name of a category &quot; &quot; cli@@ cken in &quot; &quot; View from the menu . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu of the same with playlist , and choose either the processing mode , or another category should be selected . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost if the processing mode will leave , or another group will be selected without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation at Star@@ ted and Be@@ en can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can easily be inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / p / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation while starting does not need to be short , it will automatically ends by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; ze ; &amp; lt ; ze ; &amp; lt ; / feet ; / Wor@@ ds ; / Wor@@ ds ; / Wor@@ ds ; / sm@@ iles ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
&quot; there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cli@@ memory size of the data stream can be adjusted from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here the output of m@@ player is obvious .
&quot; there is no rider for this retri@@ eval device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like the setup of the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ ing@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted in the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; in order to reproduce the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , it must be specified &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the m@@ ime type 1 / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the cas@@ ket dialog file jurisdiction of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consoles application and to search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser library . if there is no error messages , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore always a pre @-@ checked back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual variation of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ o should reproduce all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner need to be used and the TV channels can be configured manually or the configuration file can be manually edited . &quot;
&quot; for configurations of the V@@ DR ( video data base ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is to use the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; X@@ video port to use . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only working ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension required for the X server should be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server therefore needs to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
&quot; internally used by KM@@ Player for the sources various names . at the time of creation of this documentation the dv@@ dn@@ av@@ source , dv@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ anners , t@@ v@@ ous , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin to play with the playlist . &quot;
is there clu@@ es about how I can drive my CD@@ ROM drive if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is used as user root to carry out the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / CD@@ ROM is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine starts only slowly , why do my CPU need to be checked for their performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ ri@@ .@@ k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will x@@ ine test the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t : : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for the creation of graphic user surfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling cables .
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be retri@@ ev@@ ed on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; Tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be drawn .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . this allows easy installation without more comp@@ iling and are included on the ile site .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users will hardly need to read this manual . however , all the proposals for documentation must be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the k@@ ile ; web page should be made . &quot;
if you have any questions about or when comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; on or become extensions desired this should be addressed on the mailing list box _ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; l@@ atex ; - functions in a graphic interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made tools for this . finally , the possibility to complete comp@@ iling , comp@@ osing and error tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibilities to experience should get the manual on K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start .

&quot; just as other indic@@ ative languages involves &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction to be defined with the general characteristics such as paper format , page num@@ bing and text files . the introduction shows at least the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { document } . &quot;
&quot; the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an important function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; ile ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for the creation of the document . there are also some options for the document to be made , too . &quot;
&quot; document classes : article ( article ) , book &#91; Let@@ ter &#93; , report &#91; Let@@ ter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; Let@@ ter &#93; , report &#91; Let@@ ter@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; Voltaire Network &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; Voltaire book &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; proj@@ ector &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ it &#93; , or user defines . &quot;
enco@@ ding : this is called the character enco@@ ding . it should use the character enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x to be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used maps for &amp; l@@ atex ; for incorpor@@ ating it only in the cross @-@ crossing field .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) : the documentation of Kom@@ a script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users will not have to worry about this . only a brief description of the functions and further information can be found in the section below .
&quot; offers - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; a simple problem search has not been closed on the screen . however , by the modest appearance of the output file you have noticed . however , it will save you by the mom@@ entary appearance of time and force . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic refinement of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically create a space line ( for input the text ) and the mounted line to the locker room ( e.g. \ \ \ &apos; command } ) . this function can be checked in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; gives the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most common and subtle element ) :
&quot; when you view the document on the structure view , the individual elements can be changed by one mouse click on the respective . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating a DV@@ I ; file e V V I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer for the corresponding line in &amp; l@@ atex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file lists a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information like the font and is besides PDF document type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and print from DV@@ I ; files for different systems and tools . &quot;
&quot; when using the software search , the elements of the DV@@ I ; file with the editor have been shortened , becomes the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in &amp; l@@ atex ; file text was clicked , becomes the corresponding point in the DV@@ I ; viewers are sc@@ anned . &quot;
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work is simplified with other involved .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
fast : the &amp; l@@ atex ; implementation text will be compiled and the result automatically appears ( unless there are no mistakes in the source code ) .
&quot; file awakening : in this mode the DV@@ I ; file can be raised in this mode , the file is active , and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; according to the rapid construction . &quot;
&quot; in view of the Edit tool@@ bar you should be driven by the three gro@@ o@@ aks of the selection fields . the selection fields have been developed for fast detection of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the fast occurrence of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The inde@@ b@@ ble &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the drop @-@ field further is important for items such as keywords , fox , notes or references . the items are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a designation for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : to be used to a reference to a fixed name ( select a selection field ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a selection list is displayed with literary classification . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b ; the files can be written naturally in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¢ teau will be used for determining the fonts . it can be specified the fonts for the main text , the joints , etc . it is the following font to support : &quot;
&quot; with the call of &amp; ile ; there are two choices for creating a new document by selecting the document art and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; brack@@ ets after the command \ \ News class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font . if the font is not fixed at the beginning , this may also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the o@@ vers@@ al code example has to be entered , the &amp; l@@ atex must be compiled . the easiest way for this is to use the building &apos;s building or button @-@ cutting . &quot;
the source text must be stored in front of comp@@ iling . &amp; ile ; if the storage is automatically saved .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched in the protocol for errors . when using Quick @-@ construction should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font is 12 created and only a few sentences should have a different type of font . the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ . &quot;
the changes are limited only within the area ( from \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { environment } up to \ \ end { premature ejaculation } ) . there is no description ( number ) for the changes within a environment .
&quot; there are many options for improving the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , fatty pressure , spa printing , sub@@ s@@ acks , sub@@ missions , etc. are added automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ ative pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a \ \ \ { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ ratio : created a quotation in the document . the quote begins with \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background is presented to writing the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; recording language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wizard a bit text was entered , a few adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . therefore , a quotation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ ative pressure and a poem come to use to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , with editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E again , it can return to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer its window has to be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DV@@ I ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . &quot;
&quot; DV@@ I , is a good file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ trans@@ duc@@ ers or computer screen . &quot;
for printing a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I - can then print the document using file print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is properly set ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar permits the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file in other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file has been created from the &amp; l@@ atex ; file text was created , the conversion can begin by using other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre @-@ search for the direct jump from the editor to the developed position within the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ bin@@ der files . to this end only Modern under Settings box needs to set up ... tools to store construction .
&quot; to search for the preliminary search , the mouse @-@ line must be positioned in a line of the source tex@@ tes and slept on pre @-@ search results . the jump to the corresponding place in the DV@@ I ; viewers will be done so . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; set up and attached to the corresponding line ; defined as text editor ; set up as text editor ... editor )
&quot; should there be a mistake when using the &amp; DV@@ I ; viewers are unable to make a mistake . should be a mistake , this will be displayed in the protocol file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file opens the source file in the source code . the log file always gives the line in which the error appears . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , must be clicked on the error in the log and &amp; b ; jumps to the bug line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as shown on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the chosen template for the document . the options presented are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document may be written either from scratch or use an assistant for fast creation of a new document . more information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates are available in &amp; ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , you must either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file required , or a new file can be created . &amp; ile ; can create a new template using a piece of layout and a template to create a template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file , some strings also be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... attitudes General . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically they will be used as follows : \ \ News class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and the closing of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template cannot be used instead of default . &quot;
a template can be made of any &amp; l@@ atex ; files created . an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and to be carried out under described steps .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as internal Editor ; as internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the mobility of reading and showing threads of many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for you can be made directly out &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his options should learn the manual on K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile , can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; ile &amp; ile ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; instruction reference , which can be called by La@@ Te@@ X reference , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syn@@ tax . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ clicking with penetr@@ ated shr@@ ub button to hide the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . &quot;
&quot; when pulling the text with a left mouse button , the text will be copied automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow , you can taste parts of the source text in the editing window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile : has the mobility of various kinds of source texts to search and to mention this . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can be included in the spr@@ ing@@ time of book@@ marks . it is a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . this is also highlighted this jumping brand , so that in the first input of a sign automatically becomes yellow . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; K@@ ate , have already been added in &amp; ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special orders for their selection . below Edit selection , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; through a paragraph , a complete paragraph ( like in other text audi@@ tors ) . with a paragraph it is not included a text with random lines ( such as in other Tex@@ ts@@ dit@@ ors ) . with a paragraph it is not included a text with random lines ( like in other text color ) . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the clear@@ ance are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current currency position . this selection also has an advanced meaning , as this command also l@@ atex ; commands with a living room ( * ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for the light of a part of the document may be removed from this first , and by dr@@ ens the key . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key@@ word c@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire row is removed . &amp; k@@ ile : offers the following commands to describe the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing pane .
it has already been indicated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; for this reason offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for NF additional orders among mach@@ ining surroundings for an adequate work with &amp; l@@ atex ;
this command turns to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to travel the surroundings .
this command turns to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the locker room of the surroundings .
if the cursor is in front or within the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { environment } is j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many po@@ ised ambient commands may be lost quickly the highest view . this command slept the most recently used environment , so that the wast@@ eful ambient structure is not available . &quot;
&amp; ile ; offers also special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . at Edi@@ Te@@ X group are a few important commands that suit those from mach@@ ining surroundings .
this command turns into the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the wel@@ ded brack@@ et .
this command turns to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded brack@@ et .
&quot; if the cursor is before or behind the wel@@ ded brack@@ et of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of swal@@ lowed groups brack@@ ets can be lost quickly the highest view . this command include the most recently used group , so that the t@@ ach@@ i@@ dered structure of &amp; tex ; -@@ groups do not count . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; are used for purpose @-@ purpose characters as courses . for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple instructions is used . &amp; ile ; knows this case and for two slept with space for l@@ atex ; one . &quot;
this automatic set of double stri@@ ps can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and ex@@ cre@@ ted .
&quot; there can also be common settings ( e.g. , german or French ) and thus German or French characters . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; for Shift key of the Shift key : the current position within a list of lists ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is found , for example , not just a character , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a tables environment I slept &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a decent ch@@ illing switch .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ assembled &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . this can be added under settings . set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables - environments , and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; if this tab is not enough , for the columns of the current table . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate , already offered a good source text version , this one was added in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) still expanded . all of these modes may be set up for different ways of work under settings K@@ ile ... complete . &quot;
in the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { Sur@@ round@@ ings } becomes &amp; cle@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ \ { Sur@@ round@@ ings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; the last character of the input is removed , the last character of the input is removed and is accordingly , the complete list of the entry . on the other hand , the list may also shr@@ ink by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are included in the selection of a command . alternatively , the descriptions are included , so that simply jump to these positions by editing jumping brands N@@ Ã ¤ est jumping brand new , and the desirable parameters can then be used . &quot;
&quot; under settings , set up ; set up ; set up settings on these lists can be made . there are many different ways to use &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands , as well as a number of common language to be used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not appropriate for the completion of environments . it will have to be entered into a few letters with \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for refinement of the environments . &quot;
&quot; with the call of compensation mode , the appropriate environment or key@@ note key is the command to travel automatically and it appears \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN . after that , the environment can be continued on the easiest way and by the entry of the input . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; re@@ alises that it is a list of lists , it is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; under settings , set up ; set up ; loading settings can be made for these lists . this mode uses the list of default mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands . &quot;
&quot; in favor of user @-@ defined lists of depar@@ tures , which are immediately replaced by lum@@ ber character strings . as an example of a down@@ stream list , the lists can be used in ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word contract mode is introduced , the letter L is introduced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ x , the letter L is replaced by the string string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ irl@@ pools are not helpful for automatic re@@ plac@@ ements , however , was found that many was@@ hes are written in a document more than once . thus offering &amp; ile ; the completion of all already written ones . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu , set up a ile ... K@@ ile promises to be removed . here also the swelling can be specified for the display of the clas@@ p . &quot;

&quot; the dialogue with graphics , design and graphics are designed as simple as possible . to view the basics of the Graph@@ ics formats , the sections should be considered and he@@ eded . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF -@@ files , but offer excellent foundation for example and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script , tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to watch the result of the work you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ing in menu @-@ creating comp@@ iling , creation and create view . &quot;

&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; do have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can &apos;t wait from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install one plug @-@ in or part , we begin with the menu plugins . so the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows to manage all included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI , element in it : &quot;
&quot; here you can enter the search path , to add plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in . &quot;
often working on a project several individuals in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; supports the declaration of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project @-@ Properties configured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by taking the team member out of the list and the button appears as pressing . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) appears after you are : text .
nickname and attitude of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event of information to the team leaders when something specific is happening . see , for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed when something specific to be done in the project . an example would be the record of aper@@ ture and end @-@ out of the project , so that a file will be saved , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that will be added to the project , as soon as it is added to the project , etc . ; &quot;
&quot; on the page of events of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email is sent to the addres@@ see selected in the recipient @-@ list . the addres@@ see may be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see , we@@ i will be set up such a ladder . &quot;
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
&quot; type of notes is simple . it can be selected either the note entry from the editor @-@ context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary section followed by default text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname of the one @-@ named nickname of sub@@ project leader After the departments and sub@@ project lad@@ ders should be led to the corresponding domain names or sub@@ project names as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roles names are independent of large @-@ scale or mini@@ ature , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages , which is D@@ T@@ D @-@ diagnostic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ specific settings treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog covers some sites that are dealt with one another .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; regarding tags , including car complete , can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / small spelling of tags : large / small spelling of automatically inserted tags . normal large / small spelling means , the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small spelling of attributes : large / small spelling of automatically inserted attributes . normal large / small spelling means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
optional tags automatically close : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; start @-@ up and finish date automatically : when switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic vom@@ iting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding co@@ ding during the beginning .
m@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of various types of files . by using the standard the default ones can be recovered .
standard character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening open files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) . however , this attitude is loaded from the same in the proj@@ ector properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting is done by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; created regularly backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even for still non @-@ stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the specified time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edi@@ tor@@ or or its own view ( or the documentation in a part of a cup , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , the preview and the code text at the same time . &quot;
adjust the window settings to the standard back next start is useful when the user interface is through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on opinions through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command parameters .
the War@@ n@@ ist section serves the taxes of the possibility to issue the indication of warnings by An@@ ha@@ ken of non @-@ queries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be defined the indication of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in the shared mode . in terms of different modes see .
&quot; the par@@ ser and the structure tree can be set in detail here , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser knot@@ s in the document . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the p@@ aving action by clicking the struc@@ turing . &quot;
&quot; in the structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des can be automatically opened in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree at mach@@ ining and how deep when changing the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for the fixed number of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which are un@@ wi@@ ped into full text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ ables abbrevi@@ ation something else than in a group is valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ App@@ lications of the third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , on the most famous &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be stated : &quot;

&quot; component in the &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the shop . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to store the store if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : this is enabled , then tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , whether the given information is correct . to choose the plug @-@ in for the moment is not available , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; from version 3.3 , the error is completely new developed . th@@ ief for the non @-@ built @-@ built &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger has been dis@@ continued , as well as support for the d@@ b@@ g debu@@ gger . instead of that a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , the different implement@@ ations made of plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; adds . &quot;
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button Options next to the debu@@ gger @-@ Plugin sel@@ f@@ field you can change the specific settings .
&quot; when a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; user interface : &quot;

&quot; a view in which all brack@@ ets , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually , appear in the bottom dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functionality of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the debu@@ gger is required , if necessary , or she shares the plug @-@ in with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ gement . this action is enabled by default , when a project is opened , which should normally not be taken care of it . &quot;
the counterpart of debu@@ gging session Star@@ ted the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or end the tre@@ ad to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to include a debit requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the debu@@ gger issue .
&quot; if the debu@@ gger indicates , with the execution of the script to begin and send information about the monitoring variables as well as the currently carried out line continuously . if this happens when the script is continued , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; when a script displays the debu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to send out without information about monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is attached , the execution begins to proceed as soon as a requirement is put . &quot;
the debu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script without having to enter the functions or includes .

&quot; document type Edi@@ ting pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to give support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; to provide you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , skills such as car comple@@ ment@@ ing and c@@ ubs ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are hand @-@ oriented , symbolic Le@@ aders of picture cris@@ p ; and Tag@@ XML files are included in a document which could insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever be . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; quot p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool @-@ tools . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property di@@ alogues , which shows the requirements and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; file . tool@@ makers provide quick inser@@ ting tags in a document without any risk of des@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; P@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and de@@ kl@@ ari@@ ed whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type above itself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the equ@@ ty@@ p class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a unique attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; day . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describing a attribute of a tags . this item can only occur once for any attribute . it lays the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed , etc . this is a only element type element . &quot;
is the source used for filling in the source for the attributes in the tag @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree at
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; is used to achieve data sources .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a methodology name . the arguments that are given to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ onal % which means the name of the current day . &quot;
a container @-@ day that group the elements of a list together . it can only occur for a attribute of the attribute . it is a only element of the element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur for every attribute in a dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; ( &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ termination : ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be properly gre@@ ased and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; file &gt; ) ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; to be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog at the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ C . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; at present , this function is not yet available . at present , the review only takes place at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following , an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP file is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ l@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; ; days &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; text _ name &quot; &quot; ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quot p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be accessed via D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D settings . thus , you can edit p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for one out of a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D ( / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can set up with settings actions ... to be created . click on New action to the same dialog :
&quot; this action weigh@@ ted keyboard short@@ cut . with clicking the button user , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered into a text in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but then it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) ; themselves are the Schnell@@ start @-@ Dialogue or the various Behold in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter will be given . example : S@@ H / home / My@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although skilled paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting scrip@@ ting in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts of local scripts : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ path There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document it will be file : / from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; - process replaced . only one instance runs , the text is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; it is used by external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can be transferred from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; on the standard deposit . in the selection input data can be determined , which is to send to the standard listing . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the designated application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal edition , written to the default output ; error messages can be specified using the default output written , by the value the drop @-@ out issue is set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create a tool@@ bar . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure settings . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode .
complete all the fields below and add it to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes have attributes and you plan to use its use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; edit &quot; &quot; if available , so that a input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol is not only helping you to remember what the action does , but also to all the other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a laun@@ cher as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as a loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; ready to insert this symbol ; -@@ day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; ) and select the desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue with other tags , so there is still what gives , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should set it for better overview through some separ@@ ator into several groups . open the tool@@ bar and set up dialogue on settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( very left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , push the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the con@@ sign@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . anyone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , might believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by proxy for all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; secure your folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please customize your tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is open from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the worth mentioning of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; for normal users the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language you like most . therefore , describe this chapter as I have a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might look at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ Re@@ pository whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you must search a existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we left you , the second one we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the document files for example &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Inst@@ 1.@@ html 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html 3 = Day 3 . &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example check now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 , PHP 4.2 , = Table of content , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = In@@ tro@@ duction , ... In@@ tro@@ duction = optional syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syn@@ tax . html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit to the chess @-@ loop ( except reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the content directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top end of the Bau@@ mans &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , resources are replaced . &quot;
&quot; the ingredient section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Skri@@ ll display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of registered context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just save up to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you indicated this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development plan . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ makers with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anything else . at different places there is an email to send , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email to send tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script . &quot;
&quot; resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive by where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; users will be checked and only available when our team needs them as correct and used for publication . to make a useful contribution , we recommend the resources to signed , where it is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of the resources is ensured , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase , you are asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case you have multiple keys , you can choose one out . in the dialog New resource ( URL preview can be empty ) , and by clicking on OK the up@@ loading will be launched . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload , tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still prior to the installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signature . in the case of problems , it is warning and it can then be cancelled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; it may be time consuming , because hundreds of day files can be necessary . it gives the easier way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D loading and Conver@@ ting to a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name into the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition : the string , which is published in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC / / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / c@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine @-@ tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P to conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; according to the conversion to the &amp; quot p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand and to understand the full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; this chapter tries to bring them closely with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them precisely these concepts , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available to anyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , available . of tool@@ makers about actions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; it enables the group of administrators to secure different tool , actions and patterns in the global tree that can then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development funds for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ makers . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool , with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree , which em@@ bodies common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor &apos;s window , the construction views , the car@@ tei@@ re@@ ites with info and the tool@@ makers . please check in , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the car@@ vers with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document password and download , delete or upload the document , jumping or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS command to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right in the editor sector lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) to edit the file under the mouse cursor , or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editing pane there are tools of the editor . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard an , for which a set of tool can be demonstrated . in the course of the further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool can be adapted to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ makers is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , for example ; click on the icon which represents the day . now , you can insert the data for this just tag , then you can insert a tag that has several attributes ( like an anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; navigate to open it and ro@@ am . in the presentation with Kar@@ tei@@ re@@ ites stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , providing all the files in the project and allows the car@@ et@@ ables of the files in the project by means of right click . actions like adding , removal , upload or d@@ ele@@ tion of the files from the storage medium can be performed with the contex@@ tual context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . it is open to all of you . &quot;
&quot; templates are divided into three categories , depending on how they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ work area . global templates are always available , local Templ@@ ates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of outsourcing in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script . you can click on the right mouse button , such as the script to boot , edit or send by email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links click of a element the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right clicking a element , a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears among the other construction views . with it can change man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . that &apos;s the content of the content @-@ oriented system permits the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks .
&quot; here the complete documentation of the web technology for your development can be found . you can download documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project may be adapted and considered to project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; two car@@ makers at the bottom end of the window , can be achieved through beneficial information : the window window and the problem window . &quot;
this mapping displays information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . such as the currently used D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to D@@ T@@ D are shown .
&quot; this blan@@ ket illustrates all the errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; tool @-@ tools are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate lake of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , like any other secure and load ! &quot;
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf has a number of options listed on the configure script . to get a complete list of options please type . / configure --@@ help one . the options are easy to understand and not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folders . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the path before her bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t ; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; was optimized for a fast web development and combines a well @-@ engineered development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an underlying idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; a peculiar , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up languages editor would ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . con@@ den@@ sed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE should be ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim needs to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development base is not only this possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; allows web@@ developers to boost the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program compression , they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , without getting any scripts of scrip@@ ting languages . ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is available with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL to &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; input or k@@ ern@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) .

&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file which is not located , whereby the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section on templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project folder , only a bug will be reported . &quot;

&quot; turns the block selection , or out . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key . &quot;
go directly to an index number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the news window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .

&quot; shows the tool@@ sp@@ old left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ mark with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ mark from other opened documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ projects are stored with the file by .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder , or sub@@ folder , and add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; attitudes , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ Projects , you will find the details . &quot;
invites a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it creates only the name . actions need to store settings by means of settings . they will perform tool @-@ making tools , or you will be asked when you want to store the tool . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the visual range . it does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will ask if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ team , so the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool tools to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see . &quot;
invite one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; you or anyone else did and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; own description format .
&quot; up@@ stream from the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew . if this global one is and a spelling in the global K@@ DE folder did not exist , fails to load . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activated or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . at present , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tions means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; inser@@ ting means by means of tool@@ bar , if this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed among the above @-@ mentioned menus . click on it . click on the activated @-@ activated plug @-@ in . &quot;
select the syn@@ cing mode for the current file . the list of available Her@@ vor@@ es schem@@ ata depends on der@@ el@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of po@@ ke identification . very useful when you know people , use the other OS platforms for development . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syn@@ tax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application .
&quot; instant switch between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the switch can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended , the mapping mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; additionally , this menu includes an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a tra@@ ges , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application which use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
measurement of the editing pane . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ box or which can add and modify the town@@ row . &quot;
&quot; this should generate a help in accordance with the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free to be licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , for example , after filling out the project name the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . in the entry of name the file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; -@@ project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without space with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine on which one wants to access , except to edit local data . either a name ( host@@ name ex@@ amp@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote computer , adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should rather be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should rather be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to include files from the local file system to the project . there are several files or files selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ vers@@ ed Skri@@ ll ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; leave if files , which are to be integrated somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started anew , not An@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder , and you can make an exact selection of your voucher . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files through attachment or , by removing the tick , eliminated from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assistants contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project properties in the menu area , or with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) to re@@ read with project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
&quot; supple@@ mental option to top , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project . in this way , more about project views can be read . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired debu@@ gger can be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the debu@@ gger plugin can be adjusted with the button Options . in the debu@@ gger search is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles can upload high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , showing its own building view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the Sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the basement level , you can turn off event actions and add these actions to edit or delete these actions . event actions will be executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the She@@ er of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; the last project that was open . this behaviour is currently not able to influence . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project access ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as expansion . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; changed files can be done . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder do likewise appear , however , the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right click of the right @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only more , one profile is available , the button b@@ anded to prevent the removing . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the core memory and forget about programs . this possibility is useful , if common up@@ loading files is necessary and the sooner un@@ secured password on the record -@@ option does not come in question . &quot;
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles are created and thereby the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . at editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
&quot; that is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a full qualified domain name or IP address function . &quot;
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so it can &apos;t be easily read on the record , but everyone with programming results can be easily seen in the text text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simple exchange of view , various files and tool can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened or deleted in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which you can do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; to its own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ makers in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; best about the menu tool@@ make . use and add @-@ can differ . the addition of tool@@ can be used below in the section of adding tool@@ .
&quot; the tool@@ bar and symbols may be set either by a context menu ( right click on tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be installed , tool@@ bar can be ren@@ amed , or tools , which can be specified in the dialog , where the actions on this or other tool can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ makers and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool to set up ... and settings actions .. to be set .
&quot; templates are in the essential document skel@@ eton , code Schn@@ itz@@ el and files to the link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; uses templates fundamentally like a common fil@@ esystem and interfaces . you can copy , move , move or any available directory in the pre @-@ tree system with expanded organization . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each presentation before use accurately .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually placed in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are usually available in the pre @-@ device tree under global templates . further information on templates is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific sc@@ are for the purpose and organising the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ scale tree under global templates . see for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area will always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples are to be found in the pre @-@ device tree under global templates . see for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are intended for entire sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; design a documentary structure according to Beli@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file As template save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project condition ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the device tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document , and click on File As template to save a selection as local / project file . alternatively , the selection can be dra@@ gged with pulling and insert on the construction @-@ view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a sub@@ folder , so you can use all the file management functions , such as pulling and insert or inser@@ ting over the file tree of con@@ sign@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder tree in the file tree or in the project files , to select a folder on the right and secure website template , but of course it can be stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global templates . &quot;
project templates will enable a very target @-@ oriented preview . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or dynamically connect with &amp; PHP ; design files or connect with them . in addition one can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very profound .
the basic structure in the sub@@ window is based on the files presented in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / qu@@ anta / approve / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates /
&quot; to set the behaviour of a folder in view of the right mouse button , click on the folder and select in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ duc@@ ed as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes have been indicated . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all besides the regul@@ ators in the pre @-@ review . if a tribal folder would be dis@@ abling so , except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text stone . if nothing appears , one probably is in a stem folder . &quot;
&quot; allows you or select text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project , enabling them to equi@@ p a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er , a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right click ) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copy , and insert the templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ sed ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that are accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second one shares the editor &apos;s window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ side and a cursor . then you can edit and switch to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; file text . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not necessary to edit this behavior . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will be activated and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will be activated , this mode is already active , the keyboard removes the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position is maintained in the document . &quot;
the synchron@@ izing status between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable from synchron@@ ization by clicking or automatically . when selecting V@@ PL ; in addition you can choose between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . basically the recommendation applies : a small chip@@ sets for fast computer and a great Spanish for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the works of the invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is the purpose of reducing the suspension code . this allows to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list allows the modification of the content , e.g. key words on the column name and keywords key@@ word . &quot;
CSS rules are the new path to design the search of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change about the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template , adding to the file @-@ open button and choose the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a word processing , possible by due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is like usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ing and be deleted by typ@@ ing or removing taste . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way as the tool@@ text editor , as in the source code editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already available identi@@ fier is not removed e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted , each other embr@@ acing anchor has to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool tools such as the tables assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL , in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ makers must be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of Stil@@ ts . in contrast to other programs for Stil@@ ts the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style of style can be pursued .
&quot; around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , do not need &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries are li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame with no p@@ adding . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file named x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is loaded for example a style file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible for example :
&quot; in this command is checked for a partial or complete agreement with a pre @-@ name named QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with each QNAP ME , which contains the string template . &quot;

there are many graphic tools for comparisons . so why &amp; B diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected much text at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file , and the result were numerous conflicts . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what changed exactly within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the installation had changed . that result , these changes was a small nightmare . &quot;
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful features have been added .
&quot; if you want to compare a quick text for example , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; one function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and collap@@ sed by folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way merge is completely supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of co@@ de and shows changes . the original file ( the base ) helps eliminate conflicts and shows at the same time the expected outcome . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three Qu@@ ell files at the same time :
&amp; B diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the comparisons and complete complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ together :
&quot; &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and approaches the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often have to check co@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible here . if lines are visible only in a certain number of white characters , one can see it in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no trouble when someone changes the one . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in a row , then the color shows which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can ease your typ@@ ing work by using only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder , &quot;
&quot; opening dialog allows the manual type of file name , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the file list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the comparisons is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame consists of A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merged , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also get this step later when saving . &quot;
&quot; the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here , you can set options before starting the comparisons . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; B diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ision window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialogue , you do not need to choose any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use pulling and insert : drag a file from a file manager , or select text from an editor , and let it fall on a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains for example several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , this would be a relatively large effort . you &apos;d just load two appropriate files , load them into &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then download and compare them . now you can copy the relevant sections just paste and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you can &apos;t pull out anything &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the par@@ ach@@ ute of text is supported in a comparison window . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the character number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ de info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , then the mouse will display a while on the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees in color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is different to red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the contrac@@ tion column . if differences were found , the color shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only the relevant modifications . ( at C / C + + for example , are white characters only in strings and commentary , relevant to the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line which separates the constitu@@ ent column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the character is activated , the line is shown on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has a info line with the address issue : to file the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved is the saving de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next sol@@ dered / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison shots are used , each difference is also to be resolved at the same time a conflict of manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will also be visible the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left appears a black beams .
&quot; sometimes through automatic editing , or by manual editing no further line remains in the group ; then in these lines the text is displayed : no line in the list drops ; this text appears either in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er you may need to copy and insert elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if in selecting the sources ignore the options , ignore or ignore C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly navig@@ ating with the images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , right , beginning , end , str@@ g @-@ start and Str@@ g @-@ end , si@@ w how you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ abe@@ window , you can also use the other keys for editing . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between shelves and trans@@ verse mode . ( default is the button mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the Com@@ prehen@@ sive columns syn@@ cing the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as already in the section together and the edi@@ table ex@@ chan@@ g@@ ated window was explained ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture back@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflicts . therefore , all of the automatically sol@@ dered conflicts must also be regarded as conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ ts ) . if this option is activated , whatever you mark , automatically copy into the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying . be careful with this option however , as you could wi@@ pe out the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board accidentally . &quot;
&quot; poin@@ ter will be stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a poin@@ ter code characters \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use auto @-@ run code \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 maintains the poin@@ ter of the source files not , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically and restored during the next start . ( Re@@ stell@@ ungen@@ - &gt; C@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences are displayed in cur@@ sive script . if the chosen scrip@@ ture does not support this display , does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; systems with only 16 or 256 colours could not be available in their pure form but would be represented . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically displays an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the button press button is inserted with the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you enter input or return , the inser@@ tion of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which poin@@ ter type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used .
&quot; the comparison of files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step is not ignored . the second step is not ignored . the second step is not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon sign &apos; \ \ &apos; and a poin@@ ter course &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again save only one poin@@ ts@@ &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the car is enabled , however , like a white character . during which this option must be disabled , however , this option must be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of analysis , figures and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like modifications in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the option is still looking for smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ Continu@@ ing mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you need to ignore the Autom@@ atic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments .
&quot; these options are treated in the chapter for scanning , folders and diar@@ rhe@@ a co @-@ operation . take a look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merger . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , this will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adapting the language of the user interface . the amendment of this option does not affect the current running program . you need to quit &amp; diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is distributed globally via the Control Center . ) &quot;
the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you are activated this option is used for all entries the upper settings .
about the selection fields for the co@@ ding appears a short notice what the local co@@ ding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpretation . as the code is adjustable for each file individually , even files can be compared with different co@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; when you have edited a file , you can set here which enco@@ ding to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example your files may be 16 @-@ bit uniform , but the pre @-@ processing command can only specify with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option , you can define the enco@@ ding of the output commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to sup@@ press release changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available , if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences are displayed in a color@@ fully co@@ ded se@@ der column ; but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ C ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ C is displayed in addition to the normal yet another excess column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen rather for long lines . bl@@ ends just the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
orders the comparison table next to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu ) .
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide not to merge the files together . a simple click starts running and uses the file name of the last source file as a pre @-@ issued name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the file , then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , you will first be handed over to this external command . in &amp; out diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own processor , which is exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut trouble @-@ breaking parts or to correct the recovery . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is specified first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is specified first . you can write your own processor that is exactly your requirements . each entry line must have an associated issue line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to enable the user to create more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users want to program it yourself . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely inadequate . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for poin@@ ter straight to convert the entry into large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; That &apos;s . * is a erg@@ istic expression of the text found on each string . the \ \ U found the found text in the first brack@@ et . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
&quot; CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated text strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . all following the same pattern is $ \ \ \ _ BAR _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _ browser _ log _ browser _ log _ log _
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you might even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ ati@@ veness of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for po@@ distr@@ ab@@ le.@@ sed &apos;s / / g &apos; everyone of the sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hand is replaced by nothing , so practically er@@ ased . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ alizations at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead , you can also use something different like e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch . However , some details are different with per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the stated &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor will retain for display and to merge . the further operations only change the data , which looks like the poin@@ ter @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the poin@@ ter equ@@ ator displays the output of normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively compare and merge . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... &quot; it can sim@@ ulate and show the sim@@ ulated changes , without carrying them out , &quot;
... &quot; selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the comparison of individual files . you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folder are merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was given , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start together . to run it , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will receive a small news window over the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and a folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is normally folded . you can click on a folder by clicking on the + / - , or use the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories can be split up to or cl@@ ap all sub@@ directories . &quot;
&quot; if you want to double click on a file , the file will be started and it will appear a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type differently is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . in such a case , the inter@@ rup@@ ting action may not be automatically selected . if that is run together , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered identical , if your whole content is identical . then also folders the same color . in folders , age is insignificant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copying of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copying of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not a : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be run together . &quot;
... a and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be run together . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two ste@@ wards and no explicit target file were specified and if the option directories are active . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... a and B exist but are not identical : merge together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after the comp@@ uted B &amp; B @-@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged , then select the option new file instead of running ( uns@@ afe ) , then investig@@ ating &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and strikes the newer file to copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not eliminated , the folder may not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , a file after the other is rep@@ lic@@ ated . it &apos;s Status column shows he@@ el when the merged result was successful , and according to other messages , if something un@@ expec@@ tedly ended up . if the result is completed , you should check out a last check and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the furnishings dialog box the file @-@ method full analysis is selected , K@@ wan@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ inhabited , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for detached conflict is only indicated when three folders compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the straight selected item ( file or odds ) , or any entries at once . if you have selected all the inter@@ hr actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode C , it is used as a target to merge with the two @-@ folder B , and will be used as a destination and used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check out whether all entries should be displayed in the target folder . there are some options listed in the folder structure . check out these options to avoid unnecessary surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : pick up directories / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to run only the current listing or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting data types still exist , such actions exist , a message appears to indicate the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options passing , sim@@ ulate and abor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ u@@ ct if you would like to see what would happen , without which really changes are made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute specific actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together a single file ) , then the screen@@ shot will pop up window ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , you will re @-@ launch directory li@@ tigation / resume or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . so you have the option to choose another action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the result . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually merged , notice &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and results in the later merge all entries are not recorded again . even if this merged , these entries will be considered done . only when you change the merged action , these entries will again be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; C@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merger with these options :
only files that match to the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . you can split the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp . * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folder must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ding characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ding characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignore files that would be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems this option is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the sub@@ tree or not . this option is switched on in the default setting .
&quot; for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links are treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively test . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not lead to possible recur@@ sions . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not lead to possible recur@@ ren@@ ders and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cras@@ hes . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis of each file leads through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ ts , un@@ inhabited , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slower if it is applied to files that does not contain text . ( enter similar anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder via a slow network , it may possibly be faster , only the changing date and file size . however , this speed item will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t take a real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equally big . this can be useful for example when copying the change of change . please be used with caution . this option is slo@@ ping in default .
&quot; activate the syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been indicated . in this mode , the proposals to merge together are identical . the results from the merged files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uncertain because it is provided the knowledge that the other file has not been modified . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets deleted . if an old backup file is deleted with the .@@ ori@@ g extension it will also affect the normal composite folder . this option is switched on in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder will remain visible on the merged single files ; you can switch to the window list with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window list &amp; text window divide the window in the window -@@ menu and switch switching between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file easily by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry into the folder . you can also run a single file directly without having to run the folder , and the file will not run together once you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re@@ read the directory again : list menu : new &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to the opening , which are located on local or remote computers . &quot;
the first command line compares a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax as local files and folders . some things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relatively un@@ und@@ . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
special characters must be mas@@ hed out . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification of the original date . ( note the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose purpose is currently being seen as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts at first always the built @-@ in differences of viewers . in order to start diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences @-@ viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a Part 2 ; the name of the original files in the Uni@@ fied format is . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - No diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the comparisons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that result , or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the sound mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist it comp@@ are ) are already there . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool @-@ collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or go that way .
&quot; you may have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be the correct pre@@ fix for K@@ DE . in the pre @-@ setting install configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find resources for user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this issue . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if the lines of the next to each other , this in@@ is , but this is , the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design an extra file format that could store this information . &quot;
the expense was so far too large . you can restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used to add another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c linear ; published and the text does not allow itself to delete . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to emphas@@ ise of differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and missing the purpose . please use a different editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ wan@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; &quot; &quot; diff@@ 3 ; &quot; &quot; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system installed in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; because &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ ew ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; cutting ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or re@@ br@@ alt removal ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ br@@ alt inser@@ ting ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current currency position , or replaces the current marking . &quot;
&quot; only differences : files which are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently also not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re@@ read changes to these options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries to show the differences . this also leads to that identical files are not included in the target folder . if the target folder does not already exist in the target file . ( the behavior will probably be amended after the target file . ) This option is likely to be switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in the default file . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source using cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already there , they will be removed when clicking the button accordingly . &quot;
in default this option is disabled . under@@ race in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a th@@ umb@@ schau of all virtual spaces . it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the work@@ space , change their size , stop them or move them . this works in a desktop as well as in several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual spaces as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and can be moved on the desktop and on the other . &quot;
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work@@ space .
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : when on an empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only been clicked on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries of minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ise , on desktop and ending . the commands make the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to one application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when applied to a application .
&quot; if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other labour areas . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , you will appear in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual spaces are shown . &quot;
&quot; crossing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual spaces display . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with Ord@@ in@@ al@@ pay , and eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as a small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , displayed . otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to enable them to choose from . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol displays the windows with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the order of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will be determined : classic lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager appear : in a 2@@ x@@ n R@@ aster , all virtual spaces are known in a horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically in a ver@@ tically series , which is very good for the presentation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that he can display in size , display the window as symbols or with their content and move . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent output pick up ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this is not yet changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ rit@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you have no des@@ ks for the file , you need to register as a user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you have to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ s@@ transpar@@ ence and assign this one value . possible values are : &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s a screen shot . you can jump with &amp; k@@ likes ; a part of the screen , so as if you read the paper for various users . this documentation includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ likes ; &quot;
&quot; this is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced by new features . it is optimised for use on powerful machines . &quot;
&quot; when you &amp; k@@ likes ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of screen . below , this window appears as a magnific@@ ation window . below , this window appears as an extension window . below , this window appears as an extension window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting is magni@@ fied , the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a moving L@@ upe . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ likes ; to make a select screen@@ shot in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ cursor at the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in enlarged window is displayed , select the mouse cursor out in enlarged window . please note that this is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard k@@ ew ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ mouse . &quot;
&quot; in the selection of man@@ nequ@@ in , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse @-@ cursor in the magnific@@ ation window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can capture the content of the magnific@@ ation window and move . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . keep in mind that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain fixed , and only the lower right hand is to move . &quot;
&quot; does a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save in a file to add to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . the stopping the update causes that the required CPU @-@ time goes against 0 .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , small , medium , high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .

&quot; &amp; mou@@ set@@ tool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click on the same spot as soon as the mouse @-@ zei@@ ger suffered a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) , and which every single mouse click is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mou@@ set@@ tool ; em@@ ulates a single mouse on the same spot as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor suffer a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who are repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every single click is causing pain . however , it may require a drag with mouse em@@ u@@ ity . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; mou@@ set@@ set@@ tool ; can handle the pain that comes when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain that are associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; pain that helps when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by moving the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result may be different for everyone . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; mou@@ set@@ tool ; is simple : &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; monitors your mouse movements and carries a mouse click , as soon as you break the movement briefly . &quot;
&quot; if the intelligent amplifier is activated , makes &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; a break after it cras@@ hes down the mouse button . now , you can run the mouse at a pressed mouse button . the intelligent amplifier requires a little practice , but you get used to get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this devi@@ ation time must be removed after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; click on a single mouse click . &quot;
&quot; is smar@@ tly switched on , the torque range is set up ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; after downloading the mouse button , the mouse button will start again if there is no need for the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mou@@ set@@ tool ; supports now the clicking through mouse expulsion . this function is activated , generates a slow gra@@ f to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow but@@ t to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; the first time started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the reaction times , choose sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer that you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the responses . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , becomes , &amp; mou@@ set@@ tool ; started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please check the respective documentation to find out how to start there a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings back to the values which were set at the opening of the dialogue . have you already pushed the button down , the settings will apply to the state after the final pressures . &quot;
&quot; the best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; first of all with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent reloc@@ ating should you be switched off at first . if you then click to the automatic mouse click here , you can later move the intelligent amplifier . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; to lower sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click will remain without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not show any link , does not lead to un@@ loaded reactions . therefore , you can park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ led , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that are coming in touch with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you must take out the mouse @-@ ball . as this happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt you can easily scrap@@ ing with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; mou@@ set@@ tool ; if just a difference was started . if in this case you use the intelligent embarrass@@ ment , this means that &amp; mou@@ se@@ set@@ tool ; the operation is no longer able to finish the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this happens when you are a mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool , under another window manager , and move a window . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem consists in giving you a single mouse click . this makes the status of &amp; mou@@ set@@ tes , reset and you can continue as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; mou@@ se@@ set@@ tool ; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor in another place . &quot;
&quot; use mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it . however , leave the mouse on a neutral area of the work@@ space , if you want to make a ke@@ ystro@@ kes . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ makers and menus and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent embarrass@@ ment , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent reloc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; mou@@ se@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very well possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and to insert it again or any other action , in which you would like to move the mouse with pressing mouse button . but here are some advice to do so : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent amplifier , if you just start using a mou@@ se@@ set@@ tool ; click on the following text : lead the mouse button to the other end of the text , while moving the mouse button to the other end of the text and enter the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; you will use the audi@@ ble mouse button . this puts you every time when &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; the mouse @-@ mouse pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when using the intelligent processor starts . later you can use the intelligent amplifier without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow must be installed . that should be the case in most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers and this is correctly furnished .
&quot; &amp; mou@@ set@@ tool ; bet@@ tered the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cursor shortly ver@@ har@@ rt . this program was developed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome and which the bed@@ side of the buttons are prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mou@@ set@@ tool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button will start . in this way , the pulling and drop @-@ off can also be done with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; with the program &amp; mouth mouth , bl@@ unt users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes screen@@ shot ) enter the command , which will be used later for the language issue of text . further details can be found in the description of the furniture catalogue . &quot;
on the second page you can select the default text editor . from the text@@ books you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can be processed naturally .
&quot; on the third page ( right@@ .@@ screen@@ shot ) you define the dictionary for the words of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can read the wording with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can apply the words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can apply the words to words in the words of words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and basically contains a input field for the keyboard property of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an exchange memory of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , right , you can enter the propositions you want . each phrase sentence is attached to the memory @-@ memory . you can select from it sets that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; set up with the menu @-@ associated settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two maps , voice issue and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ is@@ ling , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map voice @-@ overs , you enter the command to the call of the voice @-@ generator . in the selection field under the input field , the character enco@@ ding is fixed , with the text to the voice generator will be shared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check@@ box if the text should be distributed as a default option to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box is not selected , the text will be shared as parameter . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; using as possible to use as a voice service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if this is successful , the other settings will be available on this site . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu item pass@@ able or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the storage device , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection of the editing pane for Text@@ pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text editor @-@ book will automatically be stored in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to store text password , the book is stored . if you choose to make changes , the text password is not saved . please choose to store , will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page Wor@@ ter@@ is@@ ations contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ ies . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth shows , when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can currently use the dictionary for wording . &quot;
&quot; using buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add , edit the sequence of books , or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and the dictionary for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ ew ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is determined simply by subscri@@ bing the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to add just correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks then , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how to be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly released words automatically in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text password books is divided . in the upper part the text passages are shown as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the relevant keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text editor book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books , you can either reach via the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or over a folding menu . &quot;
the sequence of text passages or text passages may change you by pulling the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the chosen text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text box is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected areas of the store @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text will be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text box is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected areas of the publisher &apos;s storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this will be used otherwise the selected propositions of the store @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is attached , a shifting tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sha@@ ded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is attached , a narrow le@@ box is displayed in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is attached to this option is displayed by default on the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sha@@ ded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably you have not immediately entered the command for the voice @-@ overs or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the language issue on the map of voice issue .

&quot; to display an example of the command line for the establishment of the voice @-@ overs , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the VO is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as a standard listing . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wave@@ file so you need an additional program to comp@@ ose the text in ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the german text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to be the last sign of the text so that an additional character has to be added . the full command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / dev / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / dev / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / dev / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / dev / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / dev / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data will be switched on as a standard package .
&quot; the VO dem@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for voice issue . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being further developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various VO systems . &quot;
&quot; as the setting of the language generator is made only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a voice service as a voice service in &amp; mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup you use the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which appears in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; to use successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but that depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can not speak with the people who cannot speak , text by the computer . it will be saved a list of pro@@ curing propositions which the user can again be re @-@ spending again . &quot;
&quot; note that &amp; k@@ mouth , does not include a voice of voice . on the computer you need to be a voice card . &quot;
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address box of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ ern@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; - the VO system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one out of modules existing services , which allows each application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; it provides a joint application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also the users offers it interesting options .
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; K@@ ate , even if &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded . &quot;
&quot; the VO is done via the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the production of language expendi@@ tures on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ices XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the VO service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible window , the T@@ TS @-@ services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
&quot; an application with a &amp; GUI , for the configuration and set @-@ up of kt@@ ops via kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section . &quot;
one module for the web browser &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for the pre @-@ reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
one module for the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read entirely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can list the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / email / list@@ .org . the developers can also be found in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Devices ) . &quot;
&quot; marriage You &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , you need to install and setup program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the mapping tab is displayed . see also . if you have arranged at least a speaker , the card Ticket is indicated . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variations for a synthes@@ izer . you can also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &apos;re used , as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card @-@ card speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the mapping tab is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and still no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already equipped speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; simply select a list of the list by clicking on this button , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; simply select a copy of the list by clicking on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the list , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; quot ; system .
&quot; select here a m@@ yo@@ type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girl@@ sa to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , it appears on the new speaker on the map speaker . to change the settings of this intercom , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; go back almost . go back to the car@@ b card General and check if you activate the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts to use text . click on the mapping assignments to create and manage text messages . see .
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can launch the card system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card holder for general , to open this diamond card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; highlight this landing field to activate the &amp; ect@@ are ; this start is successful , the mapping card will be displayed and you can create text @-@ orders and you can read text @-@ orders and read the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , provided the field voice is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control panel , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can start text messages , break up and resume . &quot;
with the buttons in this row you can check the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; file cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to advance . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
&quot; click on or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the Kar@@ tei@@ card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card @-@ card in general and activ@@ ating voice issue ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; then you can check the text of the displayed page . check out the text , which is to be read , and select the text copy in the main menu . after a short time , the voice @-@ overs should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pres@@ t@@ aps and other invisible brands as well . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can visu@@ alize text . check out the text , which is to be read , and select the text copy in the main menu . then the voice edition should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ qu@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of events , you can read the text of these messages even from &amp; t@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can notify different types of messages ; for example , set up that you will be notified when in a IR@@ C channel a message appears , in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry messages will appear in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ quotes differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filtering a good example in &amp; kt@@ ts ; one good example . you removed the tags straight and b out of the news , sent by email , and also the expression / local / In@@ box since this in most cases can be accepted as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited , before it is sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to improve the pron@@ unciation in order to choose false words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select an appropriate language and speaker , or to avoid certain defects of language them and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; t@@ ts ; differs four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Sa@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it will proceed to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the continued orders are continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of news and regular text . these orders are continued after the warning output .
&quot; news have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses the news . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be found , you can greet with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you who has straight the room . &amp; cold ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you &apos;re using the car@@ b card orders is a text contract . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text messages . text messages are intended for issuing a longer texts , which do not have special urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types will be shortened in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers . if an application sends the output of a screen controller , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reads , this edition will keep and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to output screen recur@@ ren@@ ders . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are run as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; string stri@@ ps replace parts of a text by other text . the inser@@ ting parts can be delivered either as words or as a regular expressions . with pre @-@ defined character set filters , which enable the testing of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for forming news from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; @-@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form possible . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML , from a format into another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; t@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have submitted a female voice for example , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. above can be read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice @-@ overs . if the filter determines that its rules are not found , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent them through all activated filters on the page below . editing of the filters is carried out in order in the order from above . &quot;
&quot; this displays the list of equipped normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are removed from above down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be displayed on the following furnishings . &quot;
&quot; for the establishment of strings filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . these patterns are replaced in text , then the text is replaced with the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter your filter a name for your filters . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to distinguish itself from the names of the other filter . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string string shown in the column . the list is shown in the order from above down@@ wards .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries are attached to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is applied only when the speaker speaks for the text contract one of the languages mentioned here . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; c@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed by clicking the &amp; c@@ tr@@ l ; key . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , c@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID run programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers need to we@@ ave it . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 points , you may only enter copy . &quot;
&quot; the drawing filter filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box will apply filters when consistent . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the character filter filter prints regul@@ ars in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be restricted by divi@@ der characters ( space characters ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular impressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; ID &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; terms and expressions in the package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such revers@@ al . it can be applied only on well @-@ shaped XML . it can be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable path , it also ranges x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; with the filter filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the car@@ b menu , or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , define that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text attached to the filter is searching for a text for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker , which gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sending , and the properties of the speaker speaker speaker , you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the binary expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; ID &amp; # 160 ; terms , you can get this with a click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression in the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you place the properties of the requested intercom conditions here . if the text fills the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements most appropriate . click on the right to view the dialog speaker selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your inter@@ locking settings or to delete all settings .
&quot; the filter filter will only be applied to the text , when all conditions with an entry in the box will apply filters when apply . you must enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the VO API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD and can use the synthes@@ izer ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the VO API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the k@@ de ; activation website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface between &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ops via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text of the text to pre @-@ read and option to read a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can employ . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . start only in one window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the named Language izer supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ envelope set up , but when using the module for festival web pages are not pre @-@ read . &quot;
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all works . you will also need to do that if you do not use this voice to pre @-@ read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and on the ambient variable path .
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole propositions are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ized . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character code is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string filter filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice clients . if you would like to extend &amp; ect@@ are ; for the use of a different synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ t@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; t@@ ts ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or new ) including packages c@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source text of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ file or have downloaded the cam@@ ball at the same time , then install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your voice settings . to do so , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; t@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts that uses the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so further that the establishment of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script should no longer be needed .
&quot; a long text will be dis@@ assembled in single propositions . the user can go back , or canc@@ el@@ ly withdraw , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application has text to &amp; t@@ ts ; if you specify an application , for example a female English speakers can be requested . if you choose a speaker , whose language English and whose sex is feminine , this one is used automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how to choose a speaker , you will see . &quot;
&quot; if you click to add or click on the mapping or click Edit , the mapping tab is shown for festival . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found here . &quot;
&quot; type the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in the path , you only need to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text which is handed over to festival . in voices , the &amp; ect@@ are ; known , this setting is made automatically . generally speaking , that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you put volume , speaking speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and see this grey , the voice of you selected will not be able to choose these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded on account of their size several seconds . if you load this landing area , these voices are already loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( on large scale consumption ) the first sentence becomes faster . &quot;
&quot; if this landing area cannot be selected , you still have no speaker ( or forget to use ) . see . &quot;
&quot; when the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is marked with the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after starting only the icon t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the opportunity to keep track of it or to control otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application , which has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the tab@@ le@@ card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can earn sat@@ ed@@ bil@@ ise in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other side cards ) is taken over and t@@ sm@@ .@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead al@@ sa , G@@ spre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ de , click on the mapping audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text reports listed and managed . expenditure of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers , al@@ arms and messages are not displayed . further information on the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found here . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio edition . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts are compiled , either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries cannot load . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio edition , click here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you will have to install at least one module . you can choose Al@@ sa , select here the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; set the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds about half the half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about double normal consultation speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click to apply the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system to take over .
&quot; the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set specific actions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; t@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Sa@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps these assignments . after the output of the screen reader , the advertised orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just want to read a long text on a web page , you can talk with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the Audio@@ edition into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound is canc@@ eled before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and expenses of Screen Re@@ a@@ isons , there are no special actions when they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; C@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click alert noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; highlight this landing field to turn the pre @-@ reading of &amp; k@@ de ; do not apply this setting , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; t@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications are noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the button , a dialog box , where you can choose the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , sending and conversation ; sent when someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is not given anything but are ignored . &quot;
use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts should do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have chosen user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired intercom . standard select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the tab speaker or top entry . see this also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if for a specific application of a particular application , this will be executed . otherwise the action plan for all other events of the particular application will be executed . otherwise , the action plan for carrying out which is under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button loading to load stored settings from a file . the invited events will begin with the events in the list . if you want to start an empty list , click D@@ elete . all entries will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark the text for a voice @-@ overs . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices , the talk speed , the volume , the voice of the voice and sound level . SS@@ ML is part of the vo@@ icing XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival is used during the SS@@ ML issue . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the Festival configuration dialog is not on 100@@ nbsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and typ@@ ing filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds have to proceed more quickly with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first sentence has to be synthes@@ ised , not the whole text order . thus , you can also stop or stop jumping or stop and ab@@ ort , even if the voice does not endor@@ se this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pun@@ ctu@@ ality filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it is automatically set up as a set of a pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter . you can change its settings or add additional pun@@ ctu@@ ality filter , but you will get off from it . &quot;
&quot; in the easiest way , you will learn to choose the setup of the speaker selection . place the speaker selection again , select some features and check out how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , turn out some features and check how to set up the selection of the speaker . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the default can be started , since only the first sentence needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then hold text messages then on the mapping or break orders , even if the voice does not endor@@ se this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the regular pro@@ posi@@ tional filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
typ@@ ing filter filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter will be attached to the character .
&quot; s@@ b@@ d filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news ( k@@ ering ) , al@@ arms , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from forgetting the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter , you can insert this again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; t@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
on the map menu Interphone you can write the speaker settings for application . the mapping card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the tab@@ le@@ card speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker properties .
&quot; the use of the appropriate intercom is , which displays all the features of a decorated speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise elect &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is most populated in the original . &quot;
&quot; select the method of entering the desired spre@@ aders , by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot;
&quot; choose the characteristics of the requested intercom . if this property does not play a part , you enter nothing . &quot;
&quot; highlight this landing stage , if the property is to have priority to other properties . you can also set multiple markings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it will always be used as a priority property . you will only use this property . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language as the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the section speaker , which is most likely to delete , click on the button to use standard speaker and then use speaker speakers , which corresponds to the following text . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last word order in queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without the order number is required to enter 0 ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cras@@ hes away when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ spre@@ amer is cras@@ hed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is probably finished . probably , you need to register G@@ spre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ rup@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio edition about Al@@ sa does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I keep a text contract , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears that it says : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at Al@@ sa , which can prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in Festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show that voice . &quot;
&quot; add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ g / trunk the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the Kar@@ tei@@ card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program needs to be installed and about the ambient variable path . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ by @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ Per@@ former@@ filter , and put the intercom velocity . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t create it that web sites are pre @-@ read with a female voice . I have created a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able gender does not seem to work . so the festival does not produce any mistakes which thro@@ ws the x@@ s@@ l file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender @-@ tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I have added a special character filter filter and now I can go back in &amp; t@@ ts ; no longer sat@@ ed@@ ding orders is displayed : the order will be made only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs ( point , carriage signs , pron@@ unciation , comm@@ a , and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be filtered . use a filter for the pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection . &quot;

&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ly ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , register as normal users and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change into this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; 4 will be removed or at least made available for request . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for voice settings are created by default . some of them own a tre@@ ad@@ dictions of non @-@ free software .

&quot; before you are using &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check if your voice is actually working properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer , whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , intercom velocity and pitch @-@ level with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions , which are delivered with festival . want to read web pages , you need to install ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you must compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice uses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or a new one . the voice is still in an early stage stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / trunk / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone _ di@@ phone . choose a cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are therefore first to search for the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Russian voice , the option code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ isch as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . then the festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . it creates the audio edition . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA is generated . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates additional software generated from di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival produced this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; you can create this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . you can also generate additional information from German lyrics Di@@ phone .
&quot; with this method , additional wr@@ apper code will be added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice syn@@ thesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files do not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder installed , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under : &quot;

&quot; the command @-@ smo@@ ot@@ l allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice force , that can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command , which writes the language issue into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio file . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the Internet interface , which enables the management of network interface , routine and the DNA settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; monitor centre ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; monitor centre ; can be called via selection of K menu @-@ monitor . &quot;
&quot; this package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; IP network settings ; create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; monitor centre ; it is displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical equipment and drivers need to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : the device at all indicates and the setting of the network features is possible . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed in installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . network devices are later added , the drivers need to be loaded according to the following files , according to the kernel release : &quot;
&quot; the module settings is loaded when the option settings settings in the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module settings settings this , the platform used will be automatically recognized by the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the constitu@@ ent selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release date is best suited . by flag@@ ging the setting no @-@ again , the definition will be taken permanently . with the next start of network settings , this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning that settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can only click through clicking the button of system administration mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three sections : &quot;
the rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interface the following tasks can be performed :
&quot; the settings for network interface can be set up by selecting the device , in the list and click of the button &quot; button , &quot; set up in the dialog unit . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button to click on the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are brought from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ I or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at every system start , so there is no further adjustment required . in the selection list may be either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address required , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is the sub @-@ mask . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values available in this dialog are shown as features of the device in device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already used . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the need . switching of an in@@ activated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated , depending on demand or switched off . switch off the activated network device is de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ts the IP @-@ address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if on the computer is present more than one network interface , the interface must be chosen to the network where the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support is replaced by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computer can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p is required : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS replaces these names in an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the user name to the nam@@ esp@@ ace is a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed @-@ den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be re@@ arranged by selecting a sub@@ tract or ho@@ isting in the list with the buttons , or to be re@@ arranged in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button , add a DNS server to the nam@@ esp@@ ace can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the new Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP @-@ server IP address and then click the button &quot; Add &quot; . &quot; the entry is then inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from a group of calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ esp@@ ace , select an entry and then click &quot; &quot; Edit .... It will display the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the list of particular known computers describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boats when no DNS servers are available . in small , inter@@ connected networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually contains a list of particular known machines , some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test can be replaced in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click on adding the button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , de button add multiple times and enter the other ali@@ ases . &quot;
select one entry of a particular known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog friend is displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module , are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , it must be placed in a &amp; console ; the following command must be removed . &quot;
&quot; the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , which you can download the latest version of the source text . &quot;
&quot; it ranges for the installation of binary distribution ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
&quot; the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package , and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows : &quot;
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graph@@ ically surface such as a package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things will be required . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should be done . &quot;
&quot; the first section of this chapter will be important information on basic network technology , in the second will all be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network . &quot;
IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found big spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue to continue in the near future . this description is currently focusing on widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact point that is available a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP cannot be chosen as any number ! &quot;
setting up a separate small ( home ) network should be chosen the IP address from a specially designed for this purpose reserved area to avoid IP address conflic@@ ting with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the web so their any use is possible .
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by hiring a gate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 used . the area is large enough for networks to 250 machines .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs after a timetable in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX operating system cr@@ on .
&quot; when starting &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list already included tasks and belonging environments . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears both for all users of the system as well as system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and folded . &quot;
&quot; in a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not displayed and the description will be de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; the modi@@ fying ambient variables are the otherwise existing and variable for all of the tasks mentioned above . in a de@@ activated variable , appears as a description disabled . &quot;
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks &quot; folder . then proceed in the menu to Edit New .... Altern@@ atively you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and click on the folder menu New ... select or c@@ tr@@ l ; N press . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the setup program here . you can either specify a relative or an absolute pole name . if you want to search the program first , press select .... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can indicate the minutes in five @-@ round steps .
&quot; if you choose both Mon@@ at@@ tag ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the task will be executed on both the appropriate date and on a matching week@@ day , the program will run on the 1st and 15th of the month , regardless of the week@@ day , regardless of what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as in creating new tasks , changes are only then active when the cr@@ on@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , first select the task first . go to mach@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select it , or press c@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , select the first task first . go to Edit Cop@@ y . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and selecting the button , or press c@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , first one has to cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board or copied . only then is inser@@ ting available . select the tasks &quot; folder . then go to Edit paste . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the File folder and select paste , or press c@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , first select one . then go to the menu item Edit ... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and change ... select , or press c@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog task in which you , as described above , can edit the chosen task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task to delete it . then go to the menu item Edit D@@ elete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable , select it , and determine the condition with the menu item editing . in@@ active tasks are identified in their description with in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the task and selecting an activation . select according to the activation that program name , parameters and description can be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to run a task immediately , select it and then go to Edi@@ ting Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new ambient variable , first select the variable folder first . then go to the menu item Edit New .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable folder and select New ... select , or press c@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
&quot; type the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click on the arrow beside the field for the variable names . these are : &quot;
&quot; to send e @-@ mails from the attached program to another as the normal address , &quot;
&quot; as for creating new variables , changes are made only when the cr@@ on@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable variable . then go to mach@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; to copy a ambient variable , first select the variable variable . then go to Edit Cop@@ y . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and selecting the variable , or you press c@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert an environment variable , first has to be cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then , the option is available at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit paste . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , first select the variable variable . then go to Edit Change .... Altern@@ atively you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and edit ... select , or press c@@ tr@@ l ; O . it then appears to edit dialog variables in which you can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to edit d@@ ele@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; to enable or de@@ activated an environment variable , select it , and place the condition with the menu item editing . in a de@@ activated variable appears under description De@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the variable and selecting an activation . make sure that name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and ambient variables were inserted or modified , you need to save the cr@@ on@@ tab . select the menu item file . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can c@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables will only then be active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard k@@ ew ; -@@ pressure dialog . if you select it , you see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ on@@ tab of all the users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended authorisation .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the cr@@ on@@ tab to change the schedules of the user . &quot;
a P@@ OS@@ IX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for band@@ running plants on the basis of tar . it provides the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which presented my wife : how much longer it takes it when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated from &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; re@@ generate the band back and reads the pr@@ elo@@ ad of the belt . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; do not recognize the record on the tape , you will ask if the tape is to be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; re@@ alises &amp; k@@ dat ; the for@@ ks , it looks for the right index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band &apos;s index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol of the band &apos;s work changes , to indicate that the band has been involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched out by the order of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before leaving the belt , first must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be thrown out without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; a band @-@ types must form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure does not need the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this procedure does not need to be form@@ at@@ ted before you use the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; usually , flo@@ ppy disk drives usually do a form@@ atting of the bank ahead , DAT drives on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape will be lost automatically ! after completion of the design process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup , you need to select the insured files . that can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or a folder in the local file tree , only that file or folder is saved . &quot;
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files shown in the profile are saved .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; right click with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree and select in the ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was initiated , dialogue will open up for backup . in this dialog , you can also check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; mark a file or a folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is checked , only the selected file or folder . &quot;
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
&quot; click with the right mouse button , in one of the archives and select the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; once the test process has been started , dialog settings will appear for veri@@ fying . in this dialog , you can check back your selection and change the first @-@ level folder for veri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check . this dialog displays the progress of the test process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can establish the re @-@ establish , the files you need to be recovered . this can be done on two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or a folder in one of the archives , which belong to the post @-@ run plant . only the selected file or the sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
&quot; highlight the desired files from one of the archives , with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
&quot; right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives , and select in the Re@@ folder menu . &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialog , you can check back your selection and change the first @-@ level folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to re @-@ establish . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the Band@@ inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the band &apos;s content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape : &quot;
&quot; because of this , a backup profile will be created with the straight marked files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder in which the backup is to be done . the list of insured files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all the folder that are listed under backup files , applies that only those files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder that are stored on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be saved . only the files are saved , which have changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to establish changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshots file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files are laid ; and he@@ als ; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to device file for the run @-@ run file ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ speed version of the band .
&quot; if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will load load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the option is to block &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock it out in the run @-@ run plant . possibly , this setting does not work on all band@@ ages . &quot;
is the option enabled when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is thrown out . use this option not with flo@@ ppy len@@ ders .
&quot; is the option enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you have to communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your inter@@ work station will communicate . &quot;
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape form@@ at@@ ted it writes a file at the beginning of the bank . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is as follows :
&quot; n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this character is machine name : seconds , where calcul@@ ator the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape is form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds , which has been form@@ at@@ ted since the epoch . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives which are directly connected to &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup job . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; and systematic log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files ; experienced users can access the quick access to information on issues that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; and systematic log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system sets the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , allows for quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; systemic log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features , filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a number of useful features . among other things include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the screen@@ shot of the screen@@ shot , offers &amp; out log ; functions are available , with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be filtered and sor@@ ting . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the launch is tried and a systematic log ; first , the main protocol file of the system - the system prot@@ ok@@ oll . it will not appear to you a small message window , so you have a little message window , so you have a system manager . the protocol files are usually not available in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually does not have enti@@ t@@ lement to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion , or to filter for a select string . in the default setting , the drop @-@ line contains the entry to the selected filter . then a protocol line is displayed only if in one of the columns the string will contain the string of the filter . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can select another entry at this point . select the string process , and enter in the filter bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; systematic log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created from this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to identify the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a consp@@ ic@@ uous color as a protocol @-@ lines of the level hint . the color @-@ color representation of the protocol may be switched .
&quot; if you want to view only certain process ( for example in the system prot@@ ok@@ oll or in cr@@ on @-@ protocol ) , you can then find the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new additions lines . &quot;
&quot; and systematic log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; systemic log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ software @-@ software @-@ software @-@ software . please find further information on the sources of sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&quot; and systematic log ; can also be found in the following the folder of &amp; &quot; &quot; Subversion Archives : &quot; &quot; system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive &quot;
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system develops quickly to the standard for control of the program boot at the rise of the system in the &amp; Linux system ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it system . &quot;
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without re @-@ installation and new format . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following additional folder :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start at the high @-@ cycle of the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things like set@@ tes , which will only be started again . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; should be r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to perform something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have connected something together , then you will fix it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that there is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start scripts by hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when one includes a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will be called start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; an server running , that can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user @-@ running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another character device is simple , not to say trivial : simply drag an entry from the area of avail@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start it on this level ( or stop ) . &quot;
&quot; you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only take place when entering an entry from the area of avail@@ able system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are postponed if you copy them into a new area . to select it merely to a new run@@ way , you must explicitly select from the menu Edit or from the context menu and then insert in the target area - even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore records which have been thrown into the trash , so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the regul@@ ator button to activate the different work areas ( Av@@ ail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ way , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use c@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with c@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a single item manually , press the entry button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the entry key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu will require confirmation , before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ) . otherwise it is restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the default Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single one and press the entry button to boot in the single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and modify the standard running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE , or use Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way that system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary combinations of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also , whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just quit without a message when their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution please send me information about the run@@ e , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapters of adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either you use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry store in the File File . &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two car@@ p cards , the user and user list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some car@@ dinal maps are only shown if you have extended your extended system settings . only if you have limited system settings ( quot@@ a ) for users , a mapping card will appear on which you can make individual settings , if shadow Pass@@ word or for example / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; the password card password appears , if shadow Pass@@ word or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as are installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
this mapping tab appears only if for at least one built @-@ in file system space ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user .
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for every file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space system . &quot;
&quot; the group card information informs about the group belonging of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , you will find in the field prime group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by pointing them in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select the user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select &quot; &quot; Add Files &quot; &quot; menu or click on the appropriate menu button of the tool@@ bar . the Edit or delete the selected user or the selected group is an@@ alog@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the L@@ ILO &apos;s boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time until the boot of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , modify , modify , change and more . &quot;
