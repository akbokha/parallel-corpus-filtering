<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing it was fotisation, also called Sabatier, also called Sabatier. the colored, dark areas seized the sensitive areas darker and the colours replaced by the second illumination. this tool was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar power. at approximately 50% intensity the picture shows what chemically is possible. another increase creates a negative picture, that so not to create on photopapier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy point. the original image is the (1) and the process works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it is different from a satiation effect that he makes a stronger countereffect that makes the colors brilliant and glühingly. try it simple, he embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one of daylight optimised colored film made by the Japanese company Fujimovie. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are, but also some photographs, especially those who have little landscapes, too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight at the contrasting edge. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the Neonlichts. at large pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contrast and change the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are used to use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one to great saturation. also in this case is the tool for brightness. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitization: three different tools available at the edge. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpness. it is very fast and easy, but, especially in dark areas, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"Unsharpness mask works at the contrast of edges to look a picture sharper. actually, it works rather psycho-visual. you can use it to remove atmospheric darkness and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitalization process colours with just minimal difference to a color point. this in turn leads to a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more bearable sharpness than normal cameras for private use.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG-images, it is often used to use a camera internal field. images in the raw format, however, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner apply a sharpness filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by calling a photo with the edge-level of depth. this allows you to check with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should however deal with caution, as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of edges, but also amplifying the noise. in general, the most useful technique is focused on the sharpness of an image. you can focus on the menu entry over the menu. you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution that picture a little soft to draw is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool to measure you with the menu entry. the window display on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help the picture to process. the preview display shows the issue of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the default values frequently generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the unsharpness mask too strongly, you will produce noise and the impression of atrocities close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is a how many pixels on each side of a sete are affected by the filters. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore you should raise images best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wishingly picture added to the original. this makes the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can thus be applied for a seculling of the filters. thus, areas with a soft switch between the sounds are excluded and therefore beautiful error in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp mash was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a pig value = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">This & digitifications came; tool refocus on a picture by improvement of the sharpness. it used to be protected by the copyright-protected filter algorithm designed by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to undo a picture & quot; refocus enquot; this is better approach than trying to raise the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. it uses mostly better results than unsharp. you can start it out of the menu by using colours refocus in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular thread works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical outcome also from the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel, which causes unwanted results in most cases. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular thread. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures the standard value is worth 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very blurred then but should pay in Heiligennotes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help with artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values nearby 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpens effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filters: an increase in the smoking filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. if the smoking filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03. a high value is the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. this is most often caused by a pre-sharpening filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value equal to zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or smoking filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"note size: this value determines the size of the transformation machine. an increase in the width size can have good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each one refocus parameters you have set, thus can be saved for later and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the cutting, color and intensive activities on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that lots of operations make changes that are not immediately visible, which leave however later unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp mascot produce better results than sharpness. this could be caused, the unsharp mascot used to use a larger neighborhood as sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, insharp masking always needs to produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the Unsharpness mask. the FIR Wiener filters is often better in arrangement of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light to the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the regulator Glete puts the insharpness of the scope of the intertwisted area, in order to create a more natural pose."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the color tints allows an adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">"the tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool, in order to not remove the artifacts with unprecedented speed."</seg>
<seg id="516">The Ing algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences as possible points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">In case you want to use the filter settings fogy you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a moderate smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should obtain details so that no sharpness is necessary to be tolerated. please note that the details will always be subordinated by the sense of dependence."</seg>
<seg id="520">Riding dependency Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a green basins or CCD Rauma will produce a high value of similar patterns. JPEG artifacts are best suited to a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum capacity factor above all else. p defines the relative smoothing. therefore put this value matching to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is written larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh'Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns to how often the algorithm is going through. usually here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-span since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha small is chosen, there should also be small chosen, so make sure that small angle can produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral part [0,1, 10]: integral step-span in pixel. you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality that you receive by choosing this option is only minor. but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to allow him to leave.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save and loading make exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image errors correct is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and take a high CPU load into itself. therefore, you can break the calculation at any time with the button downbreak."</seg>
<seg id="529">"below you can see how graphics can be corrected with small artifacts. the module will be applied on a photo that in Guatemala city was done with an analogue camera. as you see, there is a strange retrospection during the trip. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitization has been a very powerful tool to reduce accounting for accounting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool makes available filters available to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, and can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or moibility; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow of advanced settings may remain with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixels is required, and the image in it is moving over the image and the color in it is smooth, and thus lower mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the edge-edge. this value sets the pixel out to ashes out the filter changes. if it is increased, noise is deleted. you may need to change the edges filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can no longer be preserved and robbery or shew again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not remove the whole noise or noise tips may occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a faint smoking or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the lighthouses of the picture. we recommend you either color or illuminant to change a picture. these settings do not affect the jection process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerant of the image. we recommend you either color or lighty to change a picture. these settings do not affect the jection process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas, which typically are stronger amplified. however, he also lubricates the shadows."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the alignment of the phasenjures absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius is responding to variations of the luminous density. if it is increased, the edges may appear too high. if he is on his minimum, smoking and phasenjitter can occur at edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"storing and loading: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for smoking reduction you have set, can be stored in the file system and later loaded."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"when a picture is rounded with only one ray per pixel, there are several errors that arise. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or stud-effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general you see pictures with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn to anti-aliasing and connects & Povray; more than a beam of pixels. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is a adaptive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adapted to the adjacent pixel. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively because each pixel is constantly being distributed and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colors.</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam depending on the pixels. if you adjust the difference between the colors to the adjacent pixel with super-sampling. if you adjust the low value on 4, a grid of 4x4 added points will be charged with a low-value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixel will be calculated as: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between color values the pre-given threshold, then the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which will be followed individually and can be checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the low value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another option to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of smoking is called for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn sliittering, changes & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate one scene with this feature.</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and from the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compressive rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs more and more 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all the pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and autoimmune systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is inserted manually or through the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & audiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file name, as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with code programs, there is often a combination of programs for the co-dictator and these parameters here. the manual or help to the codiers declare the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameter of & audiocreator; the result looks so out: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs to download / enter the information, so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the calculator. it is to note that here is only written by text: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc., not of the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (Annom of the Ue) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there's no more or less worthless so that neither the artist nor the CD / CD; there's no more or less worthless so that any information may be damaged at a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physically, or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & audiocreator; is actively used to choose a check box (Send a address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (fake) address as being used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used by the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & audiocreator; used to use freeDB, the geographically is needed at the next lying mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org supplies a current list of reflections for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the read of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which sample program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that it is used cdparanoia; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet been done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the loaded WAV files, the code can be chosen and therefore the desired file format. at first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss of free compression for audio data) on the tab to setup of the code. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Koditor package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welfare Coditor.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a Kodierers, you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a conversion window (eg; Console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check out the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drives, writing and readings for your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read an unprotected audio CD; check out the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, read everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux-distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine because it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have screams to it (eg; by trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audiocreator; something could probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">"the second section describes the procedure to read a & CD, which must be repeated for every ausing & CD;"</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the used encoders to compression of music (lame) as well as the resultant sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy to use the program to use the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely don't change with any one & CD; once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is provided to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"frequently / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or when more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, so the device can be accessed using other programs, thus helps a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>

<seg id="1557">"the second selection field is simpler, a & CD; entry is found immediately begins the read of the & CD; it's associated with the database entry and the filename / filename or tag entries, they can easily be modified. the directory / filename will be modified and the ID3-tags with Kid3, the & kde; day-day."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, you will continue to note: if you want to manually enter everything you need. you can use freeDB locally in offline mode, check out this twice if this is worthwhile. to freeDB in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following carb card."</seg>

<seg id="1661">"in this section, the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the gender equality is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also don't get a line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all sounds, which this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard, for example, do not support a gun (e.g. with Ton 60), which is similar to a gun (e.g. with Ton 60), which is similar to a gun, and add the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so, if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun), it takes patch 100 (the drums on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound in the MIDI file is available."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant by which each tone represents another percussioned instrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound represents the pitch-height of the always the same drum (as some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is needed to specify how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the perkeling canal. take a look at the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel you can simply do this in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (general MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section therefore has 16 lines, numbered between 0 to 15, built according to the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"in doing so, the channel is displayed on the channel. if you use the keymap option, the Keymap will naturally use the name name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, then patch is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option Forcepatch can be used for example to always use the Perkeling patch on the Perkeling Channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderratio indicates, in which relation to Pitch-Bender-Event will be multiplied. if a MIDI file is calculated with the value, this will be used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file does not stand a decimal code)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM pretends to play a keyboards that is a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards reach two sounds up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole row Klaviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these piviatures you can see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is an exit list, where you can choose an instrument, the button shines no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slowdown it down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. it can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians playing the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anyone to force & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while a mp3-file need 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the different instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="1722">"there is no rider for this retrieval device in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, like the setup of the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the swingdec-mozilla module:"</seg>

<seg id="1727">"& kmplayer; can play from TV cards, either using Mplayer or Xvideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the scanner need to be used and the TV channels can be configured manually or the configuration file can be manually edited."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparisons. so why & B diff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merger was very complicated, because one of the contributors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected much text at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file, and the result were numerous conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what changed exactly within these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the installation had changed. that result, these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful features have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"if you want to compare a quick text for example, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"one function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and collapsed by folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; almost in a full-fledged file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is completely supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and shows changes. the original file (the base) helps eliminate conflicts and shows at the same time the expected outcome. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& B diff3; helps you with the comparisons and complete complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder-together:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& Kdiff3; shows the exact differences and approaches the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are visible here. if lines are visible only in a certain number of white characters, one can see it in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no trouble when someone changes the one.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other is different in a row, then the color shows which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can ease your typing work by using only the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">"diff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder-2 folder-2 folder-2 folder,"</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening dialog allows the manual type of file name, the selection via the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the file list. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparisons is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename consists of A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merged, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also get this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"the setup button opens a dialog with settings. here, you can set options before starting the comparisons."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & B diff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparision window. the comparison starts immediately. in the open dialogue, you do not need to choose any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">"you can also use pulling and insert: drag a file from a file manager, or select text from an editor, and let it fall on a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains for example several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, this would be a relatively large effort. you'd just load two appropriate files, load them into & diff3; then download and compare them. now you can copy the relevant sections just paste and then compare."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: at present, you can't pull out anything & kdiff3; only the parachute of text is supported in a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the character number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Ede info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, then the mouse will display a while on the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three sources are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is recognized, one sees in color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is different to red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well."</seg>

<seg id="2942">"in addition, allows for quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & systemic log; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features, filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the screenshot of the screenshot, offers & out log; functions are available, with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be filtered and sorting. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the launch is tried and a systematic log; first, the main protocol file of the system - the system protokoll. it will not appear to you a small message window, so you have a little message window, so you have a system manager. the protocol files are usually not available in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually does not have entitlement to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion, or to filter for a select string. in the default setting, the drop-line contains the entry to the selected filter. then a protocol line is displayed only if in one of the columns the string will contain the string of the filter."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"for example, you can select another entry at this point. select the string process, and enter in the filter bar the name of a process, so show you & systematic log; all protocol lines that have been sent or created from this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default setting and helps you to identify the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a conspicuous color as a protocol-lines of the level hint. the color-color representation of the protocol may be switched.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to view only certain process (for example in the system protokoll or in cron-protocol), you can then find the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use Filterbar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new additions lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"and systematic log; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display in the menu."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following as named) as & ksysv;. this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system develops quickly to the standard for control of the program boot at the rise of the system in the & Linux system; therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init system."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without re-installation and new format. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init is also different from BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc..Dort you will find rc.sysinit and following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start at the high-cycle of the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services include such things like settes, which will only be started again. such calls are according to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"should be rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also run a rc.in / etc / rc.d if you want to perform something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default level 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have connected something together, then you will fix it by reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you type in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that there is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start scripts by hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when one includes a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will be called start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; an server running, that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user-running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"the use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another character device is simple, not to say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runways to start it on this level (or stop)."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only take place when entering an entry from the area of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are postponed if you copy them into a new area. to select it merely to a new runway, you must explicitly select from the menu Edit or from the context menu and then insert in the target area - even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore records which have been thrown into the trash, so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the regulator button to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runway, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a single item manually, press the entry button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the entry key to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation, before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysv). otherwise it is restored by & ksysv; restored. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>

<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single one and press the entry button to boot in the single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and modify the standard running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE, or use Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way that system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary combinations of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also, whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit without a message when their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution please send me information about the rune, so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
