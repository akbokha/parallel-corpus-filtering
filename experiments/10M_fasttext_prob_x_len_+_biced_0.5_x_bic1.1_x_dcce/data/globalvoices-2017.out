&quot; although I visited the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American films , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had profound effects on me , that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , which covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as the Jura @-@ student , who had the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Meth@@ od Man , &apos; me &apos; s as if that is the absolute truth , everything else is , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admiration for the US . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you are always the one you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I was even written a very dark@@ est sense letter over his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about xen@@ ophobia and the racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he goes with his bot@@ t@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; he never holds his opinion behind the mountain , how one says so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it , and openly explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won at the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections , was the highest number that ever reached by the party nom@@ inees . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot@@ illa person asked me ?
I was unable to reconcile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , like my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist program , who takes people from all over the world , a deep believer that I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; he did not agree with the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; by Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I had met with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; umps In@@ tolerant is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy , who fights for life long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped with a lot of patience and grace , and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise coun@@ sel helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those through them embo@@ died my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump his way to the nom@@ inees Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the examination of the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to overlook these things , I broke out almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the call@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and respectful , and points to understand the in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think . &quot;
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their churches will not be considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most of them are , for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that in this America they are still important ? &quot;
maybe . perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who has commented on the cruel decision to look down a man who looks different with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( fig . WC . : as much as &quot; &quot; dence of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; ; word game from white in swelling to the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ plas@@ h , which means so much like Sh@@ and@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as was the big Van Jones , has exactly killed what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you like , America is all welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and all the concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the hel@@ m , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who was fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a sil@@ ently &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; broo@@ ds the crowd . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ ins a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a single and sil@@ ently &quot; &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps land , said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan that could no longer find place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children can not spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; that music , which is played at both places , not only the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music @-@ horses ) has now played a sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra which has found an opportunity to overcome poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students is the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and the ban@@ ana violence . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they come and play with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the lively you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , O@@ bo@@ e , flute , flute , Bon@@ go , Bon@@ go , and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from trash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay of capital - on instruments that are made up of renewed waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycled materials have begun under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez to turn parts of waste . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ it@@ ates G@@ own , viol@@ a , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guit@@ ars , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion made all out of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez is reminded of a local economist and musician instructor for children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed to be seen as F@@ avi@@ o , which he had never seen before : one out of waste presented violin . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and that is called The recycled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance on :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as humans in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash to music around the world .
the orchestra played its music even before Pope Francis :
these ost@@ African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication is within the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to use content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then well @-@ known that this ship had already operated in liber@@ ated waters of illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were accordingly raised by this , and little inclined to welcome a Legisl@@ ative of this kind on their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they were offen@@ ded to him one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fisher@@ man of fishing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ i was a prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply did everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u recalls the ken@@ ess of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and protecting resources was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand out each other where it &apos;s about illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , present because it is extremely difficult to match . therewith , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing in regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the inten@@ tional mis@@ respect of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while campaigns against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also through the bli@@ ck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions occur in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , using satellite rates . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify vessels that fish in banned areas - such as susp@@ icious driving routes - such as such , indicate that a ship will travel his caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fisher@@ y license , where they were on the road and possibly also , whether they have a code . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse the adoption of such ships in their har@@ bours . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they may even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; it &apos;s then about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a couns@@ elling company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD of lost sales , which lose eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year because of the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade Eastern African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fisher@@ man who moves to commercial fishing from around the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
&quot; amongst other things , actions include as the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit license papers , indication of fanta@@ si@@ en@@ ames , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature reserve . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they are deliberately taking advantage of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ mosquito control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; sooner a ship could be illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &apos; you dar@@ ing to run my harbour . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; Come to me &quot; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale lo@@ ops tried to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot;
so far the closed Front works .
&quot; since its inception , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks exposed to counterf@@ eit licenses used in Tanzania . it discovered vessels that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been tr@@ acked and found volati@@ le ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that is to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships more precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to split the illegal vessels that are fond of hiding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ fan@@ aly@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , a NGO which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships also switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be considered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system , which combines different information levels . it is supposed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite views and can be displayed worldwide by the position of every single tr@@ ack@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; gather ment@@ un with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing , this is simply meaning &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project to run , in which a global system permits the pursuit of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminals , but they also deter@@ red . &quot;
ships that consumed previously without a license and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences will know that they will be observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have reached a 33 % increase in fishing sales since fishing boats can buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 erect , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these achievements . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa there are several hundred million dollars every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined together , so called the West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with certainty , the aim is to create even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions too , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country could report on his first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the road under false flag . and not only was the ship also without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated into the forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of the rules against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works throughout the cosmos . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . she writes about environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to say : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of capturing the country . &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
&quot; they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government , to stop the referendum on the ministry of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . &quot;

&quot; after the government of Venezuela has rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ ti@@ ation , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country by gathered themselves on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the Return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also run in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ north of Nu@@ eva de Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is worsen@@ ing , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the ministry of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the accounting of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Marianne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Mit@@ acting on Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government of government in her latest article : &quot;
&quot; in the context of social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation rate and violence are among the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and join a new government . &quot;
&quot; the electoral coalition of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or briefly MU@@ D ( about : ro@@ under table of the Democratic unit ) , in which the opposition to the National Assembly were joined together , called the Venezu@@ elan Government seat , the Venezu@@ elan Government seat , the Venezu@@ elan government headquarters , the Venezu@@ elan government &apos;s seat , should continue to continue the blocking of the referendum on November 3rd . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil disputes and on 3 November all to Car@@ acas to Miraflores @-@ Palace . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell from disputes , as well as reports of repression and failure . &quot;
especially large waves struck the message about police oppression in the central @-@ north @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral , to protect themselves from the police and armed advocacy of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not bear tubes , because one could otherwise see something that many nation@@ als did not have ! &quot;
meanwhile there is already an Info@@ graphic that forms the scale of oppression per day :
so the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ eb@@ process - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many innum@@ erable people on the road .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs include :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your am@@ end @-@ recovery !

&quot; other value these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which from their perspective was little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather bother to leave critical voices : &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches always take more to frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than working or shopping . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as now an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were accused of crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting at the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father bear in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he watched at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he held the family secret for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I was not able to recognize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was comra@@ de officials . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state capitalism , was his father from 1976 to 1978 . Commander of the secret service department 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power has chosen a parent for his child and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . I had made me friends with a boy who made martial sports . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father about him and a few days later , he showed me a black and white picture and called me to identify my friend . &quot;

&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made you with one of the ERP friends . &quot;
&quot; passport only on that they do not show you one day , and I must save you . &quot;

so he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he said to me , I would become a secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at first and last time he allowed me to wait for the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a ceiling wrapped and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ ge , where the stolen items have been ab@@ rog@@ ated and signed me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I went in , and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on the human being . &quot;
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
&quot; later , I found out that they attach it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely spend a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , and poured him with water and j@@ ailed him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the frame there was f@@ oul ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , he came the same smell from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked myself , how is it possible that man can do so much suffering from one another ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were bound . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lying down with the face down - they were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance cau@@ tions are still lying on the mattresses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I ent@@ ra@@ ined &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told home .
&quot; beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero met a man and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the civilians , the Jorge Rom@@ ero was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former fo@@ al chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned to a number of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement came up from above that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the promise of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos; of war &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
at that time at the age I had no idea of what the &quot; war &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that warfare was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign , which you lose an enemy that is fought . &quot;

&quot; but when one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ ff , then that is not a war , but V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also an officer with gendar@@ mer@@ ie , and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al it all in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I rep@@ lied , and thou that you were cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in front of anger , proposed me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you odd . &quot;
we need no one else !
that was my father .
I have no single good memory of him .
&quot; when I spoke out in the process , I showed a photo of then on which I bore a jacket and a wheelchair pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to his home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I accused the defense of being a fellow who had been in this crime . I found no problem , they can put my burden to me what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway .
&apos;@@ the win@@ ch of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act .
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Re@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; one develops , and realize that it is wrong to kill . &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have been ex@@ iled during the dictatorship of man . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children carry out ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked me again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
you could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to pass over their mortal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the tigh@@ tening of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that man can do a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they found machines to eliminate the mortal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were destroyed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something of course remains forever .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my Father .
&quot; the thought of thought my father came during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ stig@@ ated and asked me what the whole mot@@ orized patriot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to say ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; he only ref@@ utes &quot; &quot; Na then let me go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
2010 I made the first ad .
I had finally recognised that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me that I am pre @-@ taken . I finally came against my own father .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto too &quot; fear@@ able motor@@ ists &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto , where one can extend its leadership . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its leadership , in the last month witnesses a completely mis@@ bl@@ iss@@ ful translation . &quot;
&quot; on one shield , the Japanese word in the field of the force , the &quot; older motor@@ ist &quot; means that &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; means , mistak@@ enly - maybe but also with bows up &quot; &quot; 82@@ 12 &quot; &quot; ; as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the false translation was to read electronic ads in the entrance area from 1 to 20 September , and in the building itself . &quot;
the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine was often shared in the social media .
&quot; the mistake was taken by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who was attentive to the local time of local time . &quot;
the Kyoto Day Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could there come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper name &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto police apologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , it stated that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the excuse :
&quot; we are sorry that older people have aff@@ licted by insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News sat a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; scary &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; has been denoun@@ ced as an appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the share of older motor@@ ists , which are not involved in accidents , but are definitely cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents in the pre@@ fecture have been caused by a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents . this represents a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the seniors caused 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increases its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents in total has fallen in total , the proportion of accidents in the same period has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the named repor@@ ters not mentioned in the published version of the article comments to the light , which show which prejudices some Japanese apparently opposed to older motor@@ ists : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
&quot; so faul@@ ty the translation is actually not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not find that this is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is spread throughout Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery fact for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to survive , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and to transmit active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native language . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the primary language - native language . &quot;
thus a French native language should translate from English into French - not from French to English .

&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as a mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this might be lacking in understanding of the surplus , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers , the Japanese language . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have any foreign employees , let translations have been acquired internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is made as the best one , for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;

machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the verb@@ ati@@ r@@ ens and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases that arise by machine translation , show that this technique can still be replaced by a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages quite particularly . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Flickr @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . however , by major companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , the City Kyoto is hoping to use a reputable source for their translations in the future . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ored actions on the Internet and television take to
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; ( Frei@@ es surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users had no access to the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet connection of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV was no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online channels transferred recordings of protests in Car@@ acas , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , who oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was purchased and recommended to use the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ elan providers are re @-@ locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; quotations such as vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ elan Internet access , especially in times of distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hesit@@ ant since 2014 in the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission was raising with money tigh@@ tening and lock@@ ings if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than to purchase two lit@@ res of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IT fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay has been in@@ accessible by a block from the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more on @-@ line stations . this also concerns the website at which the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous research research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet services are currently using DNS . it is a technique that faul@@ ty the DNS servers of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server replies , or denied the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third cat@@ ered channel , the transmission was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who took live in custody for the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in Police in Police .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : the Venezu@@ elan coverage of access to multi media coverage on current events in the country is increasingly difficult . &quot;

Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collect testimonies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas which were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Kurdish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not live together with the family who lived there .
just before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; he who has become of something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , one refers to Paraguay that are more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money abo@@ und their under@@ year old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , plentiful family . in exchange the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned however is that children can afford to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and sacrifices of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract you cannot rise up . &quot;
&quot; as a Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimonies of testimony , researched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , for the sense of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas which are generally not silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , on the one hand , the family , who had their daughter in the belief that they thus complete their training , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; can make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl in itself and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; if the girl is miserable , his family will experience only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon , which is held in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of fierce beats . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a be@@ amer at the office .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n was living in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed as long as a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girls .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they perceived the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest@@ ants and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a generous investigation in the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be rep@@ ell@@ ent - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to judgment . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , he had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work and began to sell , on the streets or the market of sweets , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time for learning . &quot;
she stood up every morning against five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , it cle@@ ars the fridge , pl@@ aster the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the ground . &quot;
when the school was ended she went back home and had time to learn .
&quot; the more she was ready with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but that time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to hungry , but she also didn &apos;t get an unlimited meal . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well appointed and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some desc@@ ends of the house@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him stand and read editorial from op@@ position@@ ings like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith in the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he thought it was intelligent , but he did not stick with her . &quot; &quot; the house@@ holder had found someone who spoke to him while he spoke about politics &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they think that I would like to learn poor habit . so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ Ã­ , would be back home to their mother tongue . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the formation , which they allowed to lose her , she explains . &quot;
&quot; it was quite clear , however , that she had paid for everything she had paid from them to work with her hard work . &quot;
also in the school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bullying and the ra@@ ils who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I could not invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the insulation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which one can share advertisements for cleaning agents and chil@@ dr@@ ens in Paraguay . &quot;

please tell you .
&quot; beginning from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then there is a shift in the display once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look , if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

draft legislation to record Egyptian users social media in order to register with the government
&quot; picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published by the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed a bill of law to &quot; the regulations regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , we need to register commercial users and users of social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , which is in charge of providing citizens a permit to all social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adopting the law , beneficiaries , and users have to register on the site of the site with their right names and personnel numbers , to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it failed to do this , so it could bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a cash flow . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ves and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , social media defines and used to communicate with other means of voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ers and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced when the draft is not suggest@@ ing how Egyptian authorities want to impose the registration authorities and users who do not agree on the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and Pat@@ rons of the Legisl@@ ative press , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users from the telecommunications Department a us@@ ername and a password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for the Egyptian women and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts on the spot are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading scientific research &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of each authority in Egypt with regard to things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they have forci@@ ble physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , then that means that they will be able to set up a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative elections and constitutional committees before it enters into the plenary session . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating scar on the picture is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MPs proposed Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative situation against cyber crime , in which a lifetime sentence for those who found guilty to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north @-@ east of Iraq the Ti@@ ersch@@ utz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost Per@@ sians Leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of the Leopard , which led through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are located on account of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are always less boot@@ y . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ ors in the Kurdish ecosystem &apos; and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem depends also that a big predat@@ ory is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually see in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video , it shows that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , w@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the past six years have been hit by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a Tsun@@ ami and a atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a et@@ pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring part of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ates were acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal cities of the map . &quot;
&quot; at Fu@@ kus@@ hima , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , which alone had to leave 160 000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows which progress made six years later , in order to re @-@ establish the lives of the local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as survey results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( including the local , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ch@@ u ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ect Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate were completed . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was given mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate has finished 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is up to 70 percent in the final light . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , one still makes every effort to settle six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated of housing shel@@ ters ( to be in force , cas@@ c@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw to live in comfort shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ates lived in such containers . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima in 2011 were still alive in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones lived after the disaster into housing shel@@ ters , were settled in final houses . &quot;
for Iw@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , there have been 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools that were affected by evil , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fisheries in Iw@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , at Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of fisheries have been re@@ recorded their operations . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have drawn large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; in 93 percent of agricultural land areas , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iw@@ ate , and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear un@@ usually , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farm@@ lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered in detail but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima back far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same stand , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima however can only have 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to feel their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and ev@@ acu@@ ated by the ev@@ acu@@ ated . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how it has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in their introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o introduced a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident resident inhabitants , have taken action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respondents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done . &quot;
&quot; as it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , &quot;
in her issue to the anniversary of the earthquake the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung raised their attention also to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima fecture was a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident , the Japan ever . &quot;
&quot; from Fu@@ kus@@ hima from Fu@@ kus@@ hima nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in lasting spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the date of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in disaster areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are older than 50 years old . they have to come back in proper containers because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iw@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games that are taking place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries , speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that a more combines one more than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is finally very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look carefully to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat themes which often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , remembering a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i says about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini says that a hike to the Iranian culture has consolidated ; Viol@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday had taken him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a head@@ count against the head . nationwide took millions of demonstr@@ ators on a protest against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and now have put him into an artificial coma .
its condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread quickly within Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officers is also identified with a head@@ count . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been rejected by the end of the investigation of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he put in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with its impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officers would land by a prot@@ esters and land at the intensive station , his face would look for six months on television and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz &apos;s recorded video on the net in which one sees , how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several param@@ edic shortly afterwards to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also reflected in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2.@@ 700 Euro ) to stay a part of the costs of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while in the hospital . &quot;

police attacks
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where Friday came to brutal police demonstrations against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; poli@@ c@@ emen were at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ rated and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ rac@@ ted by placing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted on a crus@@ hing glass window in order to illustr@@ ating with a photo their introduction pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title @-@ story with a new bus set in fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window as over the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this is also necessary to recognize if one is strictly against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; here also the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; receives an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on con@@ front@@ ational @-@ head with the police . &quot;

the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso closed almost hundreds of sugar@@ s factories all over Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar@@ s - known , regardless of that there is no noise on the spot . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar@@ s factories .
&quot; after finishing , the sugar farms in the region stood still , and the factory lost gradually and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ors of steel and concrete remained left . &quot;
about 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ invent .
some have rarely changed the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ zed and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories , which still ad@@ mon@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar@@ s industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar factories in the east of the region , who are back in operation after a long time , because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remembers exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i , I would receive the sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar@@ s industry already resist the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , of in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades , but the bad harvest was already no news . &quot;
why has the Cuban sugar@@ s were switched off ?
the old railway line of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction in the sugar@@ s industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ s factories were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and hardly competitive they became in@@ toler@@ able for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only allowed factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
&quot; the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar @-@ rate rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound will be published , according to the 2016 &quot; &quot; Land@@ spective &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would be around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar@@ s factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Ama@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; scam . &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents are the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory would be tac@@ kled .
thus the place will be preserved they formed a full @-@ time working group .
&quot; before the first beginning of the year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents , which would only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve of his acceptance . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility were over , and the letters were becoming more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the factory factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for those still in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the lac@@ tation of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with any part he removed , dis@@ assembled it one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace was eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the work stations and services that have been generated in the con@@ gregations were created , in which they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech from 21 October 2002 , the then President seen in the eyes of the people present , as he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of the sugar@@ s factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar@@ cane will only extract high by the elections . &quot;

&quot; after two years the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar@@ s are closed , or better said than they began to relie@@ ve them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ing this also disadvantaged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; the area was created in the area , whose production does not even serve to provide the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility is still imposing .
&quot; in late 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty yields the old soldiers an pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a prominent person , nevertheless he gives the lies you told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in pensions , not because it is missing in power , but because it is bitter . &quot;

First Nations youths use Hi@@ p Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo uses with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; the young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . they do this using Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of migrant workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , workshop guides mobile keys are directly to schools and youth centers , to accommodate youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live lifts . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then working with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will thus increase the young participants in talks such as &quot; cultural identity , language , dispute , love , self acceptance acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main producers .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ ebo@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells for example the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; at which almost two dozen young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases have been largely un@@ solved .
&quot; the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences by globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youth did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved here got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , which gave them a stan@@ z@@ he in dialect James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ Twitter side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available to the verses , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if any one would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on Earth for my days
&quot; this is the day when you take our cry , &quot;
because we have lost our path in life as youth
&quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and go ahead as well as our youth .
&quot; so , they can do what they determined to the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verses in Sil@@ ben@@ ds ( which is also published on his blog ) : &quot;
plastic dishes in Japan are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; plastic dishes ( in the middle of a typical restaurant , in Japan ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan one can see sculp@@ tural courts almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly on the menu is , will be placed near the entrance hall , in the vicinity of the entrance hall , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic Mod@@ els of the courts &quot; &quot; ) of each food which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
&quot; there is a whole industry , dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes . &quot;
&quot; in the to@@ ken district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes , which the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . a new trend , however , turned into a show@@ y phone accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; near Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin &apos; pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ made mobile tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , cooling cabinet magne@@ ts : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ck@@ Go cooling cabinet magne@@ ts for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ti@@ fications becomes increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile @-@ state .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as cell phone stand .
&quot; also , this part we have made for the exhibition at the station of Tokyo . &quot;
here is an apple that determines your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is only the beginning of an increasing landing flight into the com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ cur@@ a or salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen is used , a popular dish that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can mix my mobile with salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members . &quot;
our new mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and wr@@ aps from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ il@@ le plastic dishes can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # , to be made up of the piece . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to find out more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district which dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of foreign and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the susp@@ ects and gear@@ ings regularly emerge in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the boss of the S@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the bere@@ av@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone of bone , the stories of the hundred parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never cure . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trafficking &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice and telling stories about people who were in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and all communities must drive many kilometres to buy something such as milk . &quot;
pain of the victims
&quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; like fear life &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who had some secret tom@@ bs to his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father only one day , her four sisters , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare for the task today , which we have put to go , go and go to graves , according to the people who we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never again came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are standing on the assurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get paid off because they require a mortality . &quot;
where are we supposed to get there ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , at the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you never should consider violence as normal , regardless of what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sensation of journalism now for some years now .
I come over every day of newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with images that actually only originate from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is wor@@ ded or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person , who was once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he is scar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is , as if they dro@@ wn out those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happened to them too . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories are led to mere numbers in a statistics .
the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the tigh@@ tening of 43 students were justified in a neighbor place to be justified that they were indi@@ visible .
&quot; I think they try to talk about such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ red and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main city district : as a family with threats was lo@@ oted again , until they did not only destroy the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain over it never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers as well . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are away from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , for one does not know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if crying out my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cri@@ es . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence drawn . &quot;
in introduction he thro@@ ws questions on how : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; it is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for preparing the vial of water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year .
&quot; however , they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for all life out of violence and had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years before , when he only saw some blocks from his home , the bloody grief of his father was killed by armed men by a passing car . &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez , was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ings according to the Government of Public Security and Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office and the prosecution 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average 8,@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of the centuries @-@ ending stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; a few stories still live on new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those that we must not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 called Nar@@ co@@ data to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the past four decades , in an intel@@ li@@ gible way . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this contribution and the pages to which he linked , contain images , which are depicted on violence . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in one moment , in which it is about lifting a rum@@ or or for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time appeared ? content in social media , regardless of whether true or un@@ true , tends to persist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this picture of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) seven years ago .
&quot; since its first publication it was mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies , which have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , there is questions about our desire for pictures to messages . &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank @-@ car stro@@ ked the village of San@@ ge in the East of the Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded it . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa had been two largest land for years and caused by devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become a dangerous paths of perc@@ ussion , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
tragic fell victim to the victim at the tank .
&quot; the bureaucr@@ acies described a fire ball , the d@@ utz@@ zing houses , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people who see the football world championship . &quot;
houses and res@@ isted cor@@ p@@ ses were disper@@ sed in the streets .
many people were burned to the awk@@ ward .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 2015 multi@@ ere photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of that .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are mat@@ ured on the floor during people they watch .
but here history does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was collected several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in the context of trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not pass in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ erian towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically the atro@@ cities which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse facilities in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
many were disper@@ sed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army prot@@ ector in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ descriptions ; Africa check has documented jurisdiction on Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass@@ acres .
&quot; yet another step further bring personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture from San@@ ge joined in combination with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations those who were able to flee , rape and several dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following on who brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an aci@@ dic @-@ Arab news page , which was mis@@ diagnosed in 2012 , monks and politicians who had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to find this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed recently on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , the AF@@ P , as their source , had also mistak@@ enly wrote this statement , but did not allow the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these wrong coupling ranging from up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; revers@@ ed picture search &quot; one can see how far information can be crossed . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images that have been very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mixed lot of private pages , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed the false reports that have tried others tried to relie@@ ve the counterf@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; we have received examples for the ab@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , on which side they have been published , so we want to be more clearly visible than the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) may come several examples of ab@@ used use .
here are some cases which can now be split up now ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
&quot; examples of false cop@@ es of the image from the DR Congo , with Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; the orange ar@@ ouses presented on pages or servers , over the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or counterf@@ eit@@ ing applications are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gray are examples which are according to met@@ adata and information available via Tin@@ tin , probably also counterf@@ eit@@ ing examples . &quot;
&quot; memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo has emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and del@@ etes a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities had these events , the mut@@ al in the name of Islam , to declare a greater attention . &quot;
United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was done as proof of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were linked with it were reported in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to raise awareness of the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which supposedly was written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , they translated the discussion like this here in Vietnamese and explained it to the wrong . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image of the DR Congo was , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in Grau ) shows Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries , with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and interfere with images in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original news item of 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that draw these post@@ ings . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence related to the murder of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the crus@@ ade of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming used the picture to discuss how a African life is being under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
&quot; religion wants to be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe this pictures anymore . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens people who have un@@ intended to exercise the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggested this mood of inf@@ alli@@ - and counterf@@ eit information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decorate it the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of massive images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the rejection of pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent images readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ised and to take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , how violent media work on it to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent representations in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will thoroughly think about situation in which a picture is to suggest something that actually can be used from context or completely mis@@ used style . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false subsidies should also be considered as international . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer voice fans a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese su@@ icide ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ b@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or phrase does not suff@@ ice , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes somewhat context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find words from the VAT , language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , like : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Make your parents in recognition of how to strive for you during your recent years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which one feels after one has fallen in the sun in cold days . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they compensated other cultures , revealing other memorial and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this side still want to publish more these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite images here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deal with the worst fl@@ ut@@ ty catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is at the moment the worst high @-@ water and black@@ out catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon that is usually at the end of May , represented by strong rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the disaster &apos;s cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and s@@ cour@@ iers . &quot;
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe place of residence .
&quot; the rainf@@ alls were left slowly on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene issues are a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the fl@@ ut@@ ty disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water objects from up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kan deadly floods the den@@ gue crisis , save save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in the floo@@ d@@ water , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded due to the last overweight of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations , and another five will be finished for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents completed in their over@@ floods . &quot;
various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also declared to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on the water supply situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and life@@ guard Dro@@ h@@ ens need for their operations please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
&quot; for all , the dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for high @-@ water @-@ offerings - &quot;
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and r@@ asp@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 9@@ 7@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this area . &quot;
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pic@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ ma@@ sturb@@ ate Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me led a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button , which allowed users to call up a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . then these were then forwar@@ ded to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ ger@@ Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; likewise , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful bo@@ oths for high water and vom@@ iting people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , with which multiple social media platforms are fully exploited , residents bring in need of need in need of security and make assistance . &quot;
&quot; this prevents the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore the norm@@ ality . &quot;

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; for authorized in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , she trust me her children , she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
at one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are entering the rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with a ro@@ ud high , bound up from an American flag , other sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already done this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has established itself in its conception . &quot;
they dec@@ eive me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , in different art . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , be Muslim . &quot;
mus@@ li@@ zed are become de@@ fici@@ ent
I do not stand alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures come in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea the religion of Rum@@ is has been deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this d@@ ele@@ tion makes a great deal of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another is based in the reduced images of Muslims , Western books have been colonial for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man who should be afraid and the exotic woman you should save .
the groundbreaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid broke down the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures continue to stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continue to continue . &quot;
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I saw how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative an@@ atives have dominated our news . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ ols o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ v fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women prevented from being hin@@ dered in public buildings and acid @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Fo@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ened Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it also sees that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans , had been brought along with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this fo@@ v has occupied our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and ra@@ ils .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and due to the way we tell , Islam@@ ophobia are not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
1.7 billion belong to 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative to help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York . skyscrapers were made through Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when the sky@@ lines of the world thought out , my parents were not f@@ aded Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I not f@@ aded Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I eat no por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ some flas@@ h@@ an that carry all Muslims with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I jo@@ kes , we do not carry all flas@@ ks with us . &quot;
&quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight far @-@ spread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current tape of a well @-@ made Islam@@ ism of money , thinking tanks and experts for counterf@@ eit information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to the way we tell , Islam consists of more than a foreig@@ ner , who is a ro@@ ud of the head . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Islamic hos@@ tility in its ugly forms , attacks our affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it acc@@ esses our identity that is so far greater , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it is impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Mus@@ lim@@ a was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the fire , see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; it would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter , when I swal@@ lowed her in my arms and her the Arab verses , to protect the whis@@ pering , which defeat the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grand@@ daughter of the author , when she wins an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana Competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging to my grandmother is maternal with her sisters , as they win a competition for the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi before decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that they can almost mem@@ ori@@ de . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to be the prayers to speak , which they said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a has to be as it taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded - over the centuries by a &quot; Empire &quot; , &quot; which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dies @-@ Company , it has a deep meaning to call God to my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rated grandfather were crying . &quot;
&quot; interim in@@ ward , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ s , the N@@ ana J@@ aan promised to reign over his family in India , Kas@@ h@@ mir , family , which he could not close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know is that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart from coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake risk . &quot;
&quot; in the last two centuries , Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have to be colon@@ ized to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first fly bom@@ bed was rejected of history in front of a century on a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , a Swedish , h@@ mir @-@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were air@@ planes he jour@@ ne@@ yed to more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim trunk of 1.7 billion things go deeply into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ bound@@ ed story .
&quot; it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops which were spread over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , were spread in Iraq to chase mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a to be meant to know that the self @-@ murder rate under veter@@ ans since 2001 increased by more than 32 percent .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is seeking the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story of four times is reported than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves named Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , a African Islam@@ ists named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I sen@@ sing , as humans filled the airports in order to fight against the Muslim . &quot;
it is the hope I feel when we get up for our dreams and if we say black lives count .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist , signi@@ fy the in@@ dur@@ ated interfer@@ ality of our with multiple ties , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the scar of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cub@@ es , but is represented in the reduced branches &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
&quot; to be a mother meant to care for my child and to build all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this branch of structural hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism exists in Muslim registr@@ atures , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration officer , who takes a five year old child in handicraft . &quot;
&quot; it consists in a country that includes its limits to people from just the countries , which it bom@@ bed it . &quot;
&quot; it is a wrong and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in sight . &quot;
&quot; these are the wars we lead , and the bombs which we throw on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and on account of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study titled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University of participants showed a scientifically accurate picture and b@@ ate them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the sligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we must guide
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ed to disclose the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have been back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prin@@ tings that we have in our news interactions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , who tried to capture our frequently @-@ minded identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See something , S@@ ay something from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ ale vide@@ os@@ erie Secret lives of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , more involved Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese , mus@@ li@@ ically , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all of this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned by this difficult global point where we are .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason that conspir@@ atorial the@@ or@@ ists , which existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House will lead . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and history that I wasn &apos;t aware of when I was so old , as I was now my daughter , but that made me an un@@ miss@@ able Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot;
things I have left behind in my speech here like a Br@@ ot@@ kr@@ umen@@ track .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , may be a story where someone is becoming one &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ gregations are held in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islamic hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; Other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; however , these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools for us or who we read in our newspapers . &quot;
poster using the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ out of the Islam@@ ist Studies Network .
we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why don &apos;t you tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where but Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people converted by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades even science of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of being conscious and unconscious the &quot; other &quot; to solidi@@ fy ; as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , as he has no president who has already broken countries and &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; men bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; stor@@ yt@@ eller , by Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be an opportunity to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) is the count of stories in their original language a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; Global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ touch@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written ones but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be given to the children . &quot;
for the creators of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that may not forget diversity - safe spaces where people do not forget who they are , to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while , listen often with it is to understand &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to the listening , to cher@@ ish , to establish . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story t@@ ellers will first express their story in their own language and then translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and their representation may be given to the audience . &quot;
they may call laugh and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier .

Puerto Rico demands new priorities for the sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , participating in 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on the past 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ t@@ orian Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was inv@@ oked by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Citiz@@ enship for the neur@@ as@@ cul@@ ation of debts ) and the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church meeting in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ ess@@ ation of the re @-@ establishment of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os are calling for politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts , for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a mission committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions of appropriate remuner@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be black@@ ma@@ iled and sup@@ pressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a debt , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments .
we require immediate measures .
the island - not into the state @-@ in @-@ country territory of the USA - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a pro @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation without party membership , with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a broad restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , measures will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected , from the people rejected . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developers Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is mixed for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives were continuing the campaign for his freedom and remembering the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is aimed at Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , chair@@ ing books produced within three to five days , las@@ en excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ deed ( The cost of freedom : a collec@@ tives study ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which has been published last year and here license is released , contains a number of sets that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are , with whom this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , developers , developers and writers who have participated in the movements for free knowledge , have side to side to look over the fog that surrounds our news and to create something from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted from the list of A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title &quot; &quot; collective remembrance &quot; &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom . &quot;
&quot; see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us have started to let about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in prison for Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; was based on a basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of military bases from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented himself as in@@ sider of the Assad &apos;s government , and they took note of an alleged death part against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his residence and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to the general public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded in Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ra virtu@@ ell .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the cru@@ ising of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would take everything to know that architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strikes in digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time cap@@ sel , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not conclude this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison , &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream , and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
&quot; Bas@@ sel brought me English at me , even when he was already in custody . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read and speak English well , to write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked , he has taught other incar@@ cer@@ ated , to write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel opened to me the door to the technology . he taught me , both computers and smartphones . &quot;
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he has also taught other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of orph@@ an ( waiting ) to a pro@@ sab@@ otage which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together in the book for a year .
she conf@@ esses the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic in English .
the book is license @-@ free available .

the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I miss in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the cl@@ ot@@ ting in the moment we embrace it , &quot;
&quot; that any of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot;
I forget the enemy of the prison
&quot; and I go to every detail of your voice and words , &quot;
I am with passion for me
when your eyes will tell you
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to recover all the moments
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I exagger@@ ate myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ haz@@ i :
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;

and you are still In the cage of monsters
basic history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the start of the protests of 2011 against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or killed under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 since 2011 the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
today we reiter@@ ate our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption caused by offen@@ ders from prison again to previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ ans reacted with anger to a corruption , where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace at the state apparatus , in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; the Di@@ o@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
money from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 was presented .
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good leadership , and immediately called for his re@@ setting into the company , which was then in the 19th of April then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Pro@@ secutor of the Republic , who claimed the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to refer to his old post , as the company did not complete a disciplinary case after his custody . &quot;
&quot; however , many people are not doing the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated de P@@ Ãº@@ blica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the German wave to re @-@ establish the director to the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a backward step towards the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ing process against the reluc@@ tant .
&quot; however , the company was apparently able to put an appropriate legal steps for the application of the respective functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considers the case as &apos; war@@ med &apos; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would have advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison and has left half of them . &quot;
&quot; he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and his image pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be integrated into the company , which he helped to cause damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is willing to pay for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of Political Science in Brazil says the director did not have mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza from the state rewards , because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that they were rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already suffered so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks morality to return and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only serves themselves by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand@@ ele has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself , this man has become tired , the pres@@ up@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind you that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ ie@@ ves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , cutting @-@ cutting and - next door - prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he reaffir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the father@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said also , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience does not show that it is not so . he changes the tactics but he does not change its ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also refused :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat up for 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today it sets up the company with which he de@@ filed in the contract , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Poli@@ tic@@ ulars ( @ az@@ aar _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means mas@@ onry or s@@ aut@@ Ã© .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known Social Network took their posts from the net , because they dis@@ missed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to humans ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or the whole of the party , ( in bur@@ mes@@ an writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma into the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ rupt con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically calling for hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use of use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ic words with the different meanings which have the same code as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; written what the same letters contain , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( butter@@ fly ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ k@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he asked his friends in spiritual way whether she knew how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by making a word play . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ically - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that the speech of hate speech will reduce radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical , before making all Po@@ sts LÃ¶@@ sche , which are in suspicion against racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filtering the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ be@@ ers .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dre@@ ck@@ y nation@@ alists , spread the hate speech , got a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cur@@ tail@@ ed their nationalism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that may send hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often will begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of cens@@ ored Word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook began to delete his posts as he wanted to communicate his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use the light , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook community standards did not speak . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts from people who have no negative intentions or who are simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
such words to cens@@ or becomes even more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; moreover it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ ver@@ curr@@ y &quot; &quot; have banned . &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the fal@@ si@@ cally deleted po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , this would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship is provided for a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now taking part of Facebook and consciously writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their post@@ ings are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts , who have no hate speech but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and take a pe@@ ver@@ curr@@ y and look at an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook removes the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; by post , &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks shall cause the violence in the communities in Myanmar , in addition to heating , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure , the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating hate speech on his bur@@ mes@@ ical sides under control . &quot;
&quot; but rather than simply to cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better ongoing to have looked at the context rather than on code focused initiatives and learned about them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end with the nursery .
a wedding ring in the sand .

the nursery until now is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided to ban a law which should ban this practice , so that at the age of 18 it is 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change in the Law Law , some members held a du@@ alistic and muscular religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious organization of the country , that the state did not interfere with the religious organization of the country as that , age is not the ripe ones . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contracting partner of UN children &apos;s rights , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 percent , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s official country office confirmed that by 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were endeav@@ ored to lay laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and pleasing to great support . no doubt they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition embr@@ aced tensions in this actually in@@ complicated matter , and at some point there was doubts as to whether the opposition would not agree to the draft law . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one that was dis@@ missed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now only the President of the country has to agree , and pro@@ claim the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave us a status update on Facebook , which re@@ posted Re@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no one against it .
&quot; after having decided beforehand in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of the social media users were thrilled , because the laws at the nursery had finally been changed . &quot;
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who dressed a minister in the Education Ministry , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk needed , which has the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the nursery until now is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost worth every price . &quot;
&quot; during A@@ bel Jackson of opinion , it was definitely long enough to lay down the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook from Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , stating : , Excellent news ! &quot;
the law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ lowing mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
&quot; at the age of Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the native age of Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious observ@@ ance of 18 years . &quot;
&quot; the draft of the amendment of the Act has been announced today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and were present 35 during the vote .
&quot; all MEPs who were opposed to the law , have voted for the law . &quot;
the nursery in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # Car@@ olin@@ erg@@ ism Car@@ us@@ sion@@ ists .

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promises well . &quot;
&quot; during the General Pro@@ secutor Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , said , unless Mahar@@ aj want to advance against the law , the most social media users wish to address the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of holding the discussion in general , in a way that we may invite the state into our bedroom , simply targeted to talk that the state , our daughters are protecting them , that they may be beneficial to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage are legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

on Sunday the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office shared the local news service Yar@@ News with that it was h@@ acked .
&quot; due to the mir@@ rors of websites , Turkish users can look back to Wikipedia content . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ page was described on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copy@@ rights legislation in the USA , internationally dark . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia .
&quot; day for day is clear , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series are reb@@ elling against blocking .
&quot; although many techn@@ ologically advanced Internet users are used to use envelope tools for block web pages ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey does not have the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been posted on Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet have been adopted since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 5@@ 6@@ 51 ) . &quot;
&quot; in China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to a massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain locked , there are several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ sites ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform removed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( i.e. machine @-@ machine links ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete cens@@ orship . &quot;
the content is available despite legal ban however .
in a blo@@ gger post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to sn@@ apshots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia a.@@ org itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ .org , an open source project from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ve similar mir@@ r@@ or@@ sides when in the respective country of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices , as well as employees working in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open scientist &quot; Pod@@ cast : &quot;
&quot; there is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mir@@ rors . &quot;
&quot; you can access another URL , which is not the original . that which one sees then , is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server manages the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then , if this is blocked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ alese game photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
&quot; a su@@ h@@ len@@ des Nas@@ horn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and washed colours . &quot;
motivated him to carry a camera with themselves and trying to keep the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring us to the international stage at the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; and his home place right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal as wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first class situation helps in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game photographer ! &quot;
I rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) he had called . he had a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was standing and I immediately started to kne@@ eling pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal and to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so scary as they look like .
&quot; and he should know , for he stood tigers already from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbing from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately continues , we look at it and he hur@@ led me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ alese and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited 22 days long , and lived mostly in a tent in order to take photos of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he took a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look at the bottom of some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az Vor@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and originally appeared to film Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community of media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian State of O@@ ll@@ a by a shame , and rejected by her family and the village community after having an un@@ married relatives by name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives , also not to name their names , is also common among males . however , they have far less accessibility to fear , if at all , they should not occur in practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals , and house@@ wives , a unique club with and became therefore fast to the main magazine theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place for them only , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , who is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the destruction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s heating up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS In@@ fied , and manages these clubs . &quot;
&quot; it reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women , while doing it at the same time as messenger of change . &quot;
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini was shown in its panel , acted by women who did not name their sp@@ ouses . &quot;
&quot; she decided on this subject , because she wanted to open the conversation about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with which women can easily identify . &quot;
&quot; the names of their hus@@ bands do not pronoun@@ ce the name of her hus@@ bands , is a burning also maintained and never questioned them . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not stick this is considered to be back , as a woman without a morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband until now , try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini talks about :
my mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh on after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in baggage Roh@@ ini started their first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after video projection , the women tried to put the discussion with a practice in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our sp@@ ouses , but they can call us how they want , does that not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , never allowed to speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini talks about :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , it was just outside the whole exercise ; another decided to allow the whole an@@ gled frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an old bridge , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife could not cease to say his name .
another class member chose to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she started stub@@ born , she got scar@@ ed and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation killed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ oma red point on the forehead , which indicates the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do only women need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the cin@@ oma red dot , if he did . &quot;
he laughs only and I heard with it to carry him .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but I think they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion board is a safe place where they can share their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each discussion . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out in the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
&quot; during the last few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang about things about which they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties have been made to our sp@@ ouses , never so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things noisy , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have supported only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ose @-@ cur@@ ta , a vast shirt over a pants , they did not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion on the merits of their own clothes choice , mor@@ als connected to the sar@@ is and much more , smug@@ gling raw material her own pair of cran@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a panel , so women could bear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which she can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to do it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months have already changed a little bit since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times but then listened to the name of her husband &apos;s husband .
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now contribute to their forehead at any time .
&quot; the women in the panel say that the changes they want to achieve in their lives , like the polish for more freedom of movement , or their own clothes choice - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating the river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how the Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families only . there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club goes home and told other people what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the organization , presumably for super@@ ving purposes , presumably the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practitioner . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were taken from .
&quot; two men were arrested and in consequence , they stood that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used . &quot;
&quot; there will be the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a glass of man could bring gold , or bring riches , the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher explained by Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ atz@@ man &apos;s men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is intended for ob@@ sc@@ ure for ob@@ sc@@ ure is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to investigate the UN 2016 in the South African country to investigate this practitioner .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudices . &quot;
U@@ com@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
&quot; he warned those who intend to travel to the country , &quot;
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que , men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the goal of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Mos@@ ambi@@ an police according to the latest testing of three glaz@@ ed men due to their parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects have been arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the ven@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ ham Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police already follow the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the @-@ member men .
&quot; the persecution and assassination of glaz@@ ed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably super@@ ving rituals , has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans in order that such faith existed , according to which the victims in the head would have power , the riches . &quot;
in recent days three men were murdered with hair dec@@ aying problems in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ ger poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who explains that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , Moz@@ ambi@@ que faces : &quot;
&quot; I would like to pe@@ el E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , TH@@ AT S@@ I would like to say about good notes , work and other services , a nation in which the people wouldn &apos;t hurt or even their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted that aim to get enough wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some of which cannot be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter @-@ farm , twe@@ et that both the head of the District Mor@@ Rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both glaz@@ ed joints : &quot;

&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably made it recently . &quot;
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer in the end of June had announced that he had been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( Nation@@ ality ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that the democratic reforms in China was involved . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has called Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; and tells a speaker , he considers it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China receives further calls from the international community to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet , Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has submitted some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad for a treatment . &quot;
Norway for Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ent have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway went to Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government promised that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations have been resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon trip to China , as exports since 2010 were largely blocked . &quot;
&quot; once the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel @-@ committee brought forth his hope for an unconditional release and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of his detention , he was unable to counter its price . &quot;

&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a vote in which China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she was in an Declaration on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect that China lifts all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits , they wish , and be able to freely communicate with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him for the treatment abroad , in this respect he would help him with his recovery . &quot;

&quot; the invitation of the US Embassy moved an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel liberty and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he can get involved in proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;

the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on the 7th and 8th July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news Agency Re@@ uters re@@ alising that China had great concerns if the vor@@ tices around Li@@ u could be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed to Hamburg .
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um asked to provide adequate medical care to Li@@ u and to give him the opportunity to worry about himself from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always over@@ sees the room in the hospital and that it is Li@@ u not allowed to speak and contact anyone outside , including its lawyers . &quot;

France
&quot; France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested to release China in an Declaration on 29 June , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures have to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments which he , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family can contact him . &quot;
&quot; although the news station France Info already reported that the French government Li@@ u were welcomed in the country , the State Department gave no further information out whether France will be able to record him in the end . &quot;

Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave me that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was rigor@@ ously punished , to a harmonious , stable and prosperous China , which again had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed on the Charter of 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear silly as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the law of the law of the State of New York , the Minister of the State of New York noticed that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support Singapore as a city should be considered .
... nobody has questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to rot@@ ate the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country , we hear that we are ultimately no country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , what country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very cl@@ am@@ ble : he defended an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore could not be measured with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that he seemed inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old Lei@@ er from author@@ itarian mach@@ inations appears to be the pre@@ acher logic , leaving the tw@@ isted logic as it adap@@ ts better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the answers were given to his American guests regarding our press , our judiciary , our political system really non @-@ answer . &quot;
relevant questions - he shared with non @-@ responses ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our precious K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point where he was paid highly , in order to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog his comment , he pointed to the reviews that one should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , so that we can better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and no country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; he said that Singapore is more of a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he used Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is as leader of a growing generation , that makes such polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expect - do I agree with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it , properly and aware what he is defending . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review destro@@ ys the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; believing a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabin , the statements of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am is most serious . &quot;
&quot; why do the cities render their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay tribute to our prime minister ?
what is the value of our pink man@@ der@@ age ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not said what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed a lot of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a town / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; defense of the country &quot; &quot; above all &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your dwelling or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest section of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is most asked for me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , I will answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by providing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clar@@ inet then usually follows the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans might cook in@@ wardly before anger , if they are held for Americans , but me not bother . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans take a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans in contrast ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling 20 years ago , by the world - prior to Donald Tr@@ ump , in front of the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le blades at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ sexual marriages in Canada have been legal since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we say clearly very often &quot; &quot; excuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposedly regarded as the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as those guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admired . &quot;
there would be nothing to do if one would change from Dallas to the example of Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &apos; nice .
&quot; first : as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; to be called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is basically to be a mirror , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; be harmless , to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good if one wants to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that pass around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far , say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders referred to as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; lacking the warm , open friendliness that I can now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au joined the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has almost been sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous Pop @-@ Band has published a music video that took the jun@@ ta , which 2014 seized the power and despite its promise , the civil government continues to restore the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells of which regulations are doing his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video was divided by Facebook to 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists call up the public to look at this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the position of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
check out these recordings of the video which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursued in recent three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 &quot; rules of the girls &quot; may be referred to in the dra@@ gons Section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which has given the chief decision @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; changing your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; settings &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computing criminal , whose v@@ ague and clear rules are often used by the authorities to sup@@ press activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also established , and the online content is monitored and persons who accused , the monarchy is crus@@ hed and pro@@ secuted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ es@@ Ã¤@@ ts@@ un@@ fication ) .
the war was right in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive U boats , although safety experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax evasion . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car before they bring them into an inter@@ ing camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they supposedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users will face long imprisonment , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ it@@ ates the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; which has already been used by coup opponents during the protests of 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in the eastern region of Eastern Asia .

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has passed over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ Ch@@ oral War has been officially finished , but his scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chi@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , de@@ por@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet Union in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ asen live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; more than 10,000 people lived here in the pre @-@ war era , today there are only few hundred people in this gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
this is a phenomenon for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people was barely rising over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; that is all a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey residence of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ g@@ ch@@ kow@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings have been exp@@ ired and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult to finish this .
&quot; that is all a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splendor @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people , who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district now . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; Chr@@ u@@ ush@@ chev , which is still one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where the laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately move back . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she has just forbidden us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers their girlfriend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ qu@@ oise mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , bee@@ keeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the District administration supplies candles and bread in winter for free .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or t@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighbourhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jungle . &quot;
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave off @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants no financial help from her daughter and ins@@ ists that she has supported her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas months are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; if a holiday is , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , calling T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything , &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ant Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she is reminded of the village &apos;s cr@@ acks in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , living in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ str@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ li@@ ger@@ i ( administrative de@@ tain@@ er@@ pillar in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take a thing , &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children for every child .
her husband is working in the coal .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once there , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cker@@ els and chickens . &quot;
&quot; she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but in the course of time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this buildings were destroyed during the war .
but actually it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was little work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once .
&quot; as our conversation to the end , a small boy is passing by us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy went back to him .
he plays with the ball that rolling up the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball now .
&quot; while running , some of them throw stones on the dec@@ ayed buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , which care for in@@ consistency in their lives . &quot;
you do not know it differently .

in Mexico houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ ack was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and is listed here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; cross the way of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the mex@@ ican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is managed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ year Mex@@ ic@@ kan@@ erin , a little woman with a coral pink brick @-@ kn@@ ell and gol@@ d@@ colored ear rings in Te@@ ddy Be@@ ars form . &quot;
&quot; it is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , and was born there in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . nevertheless , they know many of the names of Mama Africa . &quot;
the nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cart@@ ons outside . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick ; they buy them medication they can &apos;t pay them with a Bal@@ m taken from the long journey exhausted .
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston in order to find her husband and the three children there .
&quot; they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normally a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other pioneers of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ kaner often talk together the route and that the Afri@@ kaner already speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he has started his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to purchase the bus ticket . &quot;
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we will never leave her again , &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that her guests will often send text messages when they continued to gr@@ ate them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
&quot; at the other end of the city , there was a dead end up to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s of Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their little house . &quot;
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus flight tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered to them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ er out there . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived there for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze the money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a single @-@ known , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travellers consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has got 20 new guests a majority of Somalia .
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ g@@ ically , because of those who went away . &quot;
she looks like a proud grandmother in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair care that has made her a rally , some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more , young and old . &quot;
she laughs very sad while she briefly introduced it to me .
&quot; Ya us fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; repeatedly repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install on their mobile phones a surveillance app .
&quot; check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , to the local , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities in Western China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone , in which it indicates the District Government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ v@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app is said that the app is to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the app will also use the app for more than combating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed just after they installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police stood that the app would identify and follow the sources and distribution routes of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ v@@ ang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block por@@ no@@ graphy web pages , from online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; government actors or even h@@ ackers could be able to manipulate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in remote , sup@@ pressed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit distur@@ ban@@ ces and dissatisfaction in conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ored and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ inely @-@ glut@@ eal Internet . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter @-@ based Media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( in force , respectively ) , the cens@@ ored news in China showed photos from a check@@ point , at the police officers or un@@ checked whether they have installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ v@@ ang app .
a mobile message slow@@ s that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; you have forced the people to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( which , in force ) released a J@@ ing@@ v@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the passwords of a Windows operating system and therefore get full access to the hard disk of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ v@@ ang , computers and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ v@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minimize the dissemination of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and associated institutions including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office to operate their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , an American Human Rights organization , also mentioned this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID @-@ cards , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action does hurt the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and give them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible failures , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all crying out after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ c ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane showed his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at and cher@@ ish that you are alone in one place where all the things have disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has been broken down and revealed , and revealed a truth which is clearly identifiable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes all honor of their names .
one that has crus@@ hed into a list of sentim@@ ents and expressions that don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get into reality again , and you behind the scenes - beyond the spectacle , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the A@@ hei@@ ls . you will realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that didn &apos;t have enough , so I &quot; mean &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security service was formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us by proof that he even destroyed the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were ri@@ pped during a peaceful prot@@ rac@@ er like wee@@ ds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough for the city to crush the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; all ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the neighbour@@ hoods of the district , just my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , regul@@ ators , at the wrong time , even though I did not set high demands to a city that is up to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; during the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped working . &quot;
I broke the still@@ ness by crying out several times &quot; all ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I listened to my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt courageous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends made to me ; we went to a beautiful picture , filled with my expectations completely and completely filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are free from the lamp of the lamp , but it is not interested in the sc@@ aff@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he placed on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you cut it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; all &apos;@@ ahu &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close by . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes judged on me .
&quot; and you are sad , what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of that building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so certain of my cause as I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice for yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have been such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put it in individual , and his father just like this . &quot;
&quot; his father equally with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this cur@@ sed sentence lies to me until now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was subjected to months . &quot;
I cry out the farm .
in the first office I let everything I carry with myself .
&quot; after that , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the single cells . &quot;
I gave me all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
&quot; other than otherwise , they have probably shared a larger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one further prisoner , and must immediately put me right away without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I laid back on a long @-@ proven communication method : to beat the wall against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my h@@ ellen@@ gen@@ ess was a &quot; &quot; first voice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he rep@@ lied to me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in any of the surrounding cells , there was a respected man middle ages who sees me similar and called &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , don &apos;t let me know distinctive facial features , and doctors are not here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to me ? &quot;
all the answers received its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the great cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would be free if I remain . &quot;
liar .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to sell all this cro@@ wing , who lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
from the distance I still hear them &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ am .
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always in order to make this time the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of the destro@@ yer , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , An@@ spiel@@ ing on the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; thus the secret was bl@@ at@@ ened : to protect the state of state security and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ outs , and rie@@ ve the narrow eye @-@ field of view of its world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , that is not a country ; it is a curse to call it co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a mighty hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the inter@@ rog@@ ations and meeting on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that are ent@@ ailed to him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to protest that day and to protest to demonstrations that are soon to be found . &quot;
I rep@@ lied not .
&quot; I used to get used to it , not to answer . &quot;
I really cannot say exactly when ins@@ ults and strikes after a friendly conversation has become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to feel good or used to get used to it , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which is probably from the clo@@ aks . &quot;
your exec@@ ution@@ er is rejo@@ iced at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your cry out . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not turn it yet enough , so they exchanged the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first celebration , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a trash collection earlier or whether that was the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined with each other to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them rarely changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard hearing . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not find any favor for it to be an electri@@ cally invited rod .
flow fl@@ oss my whole body enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my semi @-@ baked body that lay out on the floor was the perfect rap@@ h .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours left , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning is filled with the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a naked young lady : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and carry you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ ian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spend most of his time inside , times he stro@@ lling on his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; what you can leave however , a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine lips can be discovered . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had heard them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel ended its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks her long @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality , and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ idity . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but it also calls the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues do not only find in his hometown Am@@ man relevance but also in cities that come from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as anyone who is not restricted in his mind , and he may have compassion on his own statement by men who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he viol@@ ates a special dis@@ agreement against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war @-@ areas to do something with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian &quot; volati@@ le of the second generation , even if he was born in Jordan and never before has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circumstances , &quot; stressed H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I sh@@ ook a man , while he sh@@ ook into two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; in this time it is meant for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ ian law also states that public consumption is illegal during Ramad@@ an .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ed hot young ag have little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the sle@@ eves are talking about hot coffee and the Sch@@ wa@@ den of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first and foremost by freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if one thro@@ ws a look at neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramad@@ an water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has said an appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliament MPs , which support the Islamic activ@@ ist - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ tier Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , which contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert tables . &quot;
the members and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also assert that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that poses the long @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement of Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ ian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continued to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably does not simply be just sei@@ zing rhet@@ oric , but actually a more evident cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bst@@ one &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards to body , having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre @-@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently crus@@ hed unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust .
&quot; in the past few years , the number of &quot; Hon@@ mor@@ mor@@ de &apos; has risen in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ mor@@ mor@@ de reached its peak in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure lacks enough to aid the women who tried the victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence &quot; &quot; should often be held in prison for years , and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family that woman will not happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity , and is known also not to shy away from topics that in his country has long been tab@@ oo . &quot;
&quot; Mr H@@ da@@ i@@ b dispute that his work is politically , is , however , that he is his music , the full explicit ill@@ ations on sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I became a policy &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus again on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs that are in the core are political , can continue . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; that is what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , He@@ ter@@ o- or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of g@@ ays and les@@ bians , and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored up in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to notice that his comments from the context were ri@@ pped , revol@@ ves and his opinion were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will acqu@@ ires H@@ da@@ i@@ b open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which has remained in memory today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , was able to write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier this not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks the freedom of expression , and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ ian intelligence service assumed several former government members and members of the mag@@ ister@@ ium , with the reason they had expressed critical on comments in social media , which are deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; considering this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs is only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has exp@@ ired Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it seems that H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made of slow , printed and internal changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Israeli society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreamed not only to bring his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is coming through music , art and literature a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , streams and on artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will proceed and therefore also resist resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which belongs to the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the ground dare to force the drums and the spru@@ ces over more than one thousand years , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knee . &quot;
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to catch some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a collaborative centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit . &quot;
I &apos;ve been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two re@@ dare to see .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , to spend the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true story and a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high feast was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more normal people into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , who has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts compete against each other to show who can create the ex@@ centr@@ alised lungs as one can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to have their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad advice for training in the hair@@ dressing that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ dder opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported on some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only professional school in the municipality and the borough as we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : Liebes@@ letters to guer@@ rilla warfare

&quot; the following article is the revised version of the paper &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ message to guer@@ rilla fighters &quot; , &quot; which has published international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people that we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important to give people who are extinct , caring ? &quot;
this is precisely this question left the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign C@@ art@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ pository li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) that young people ex@@ iled to write guer@@ rilla letters .
&quot; recently , her country was a place on a historical event and they wanted to do their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian Government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the post@@ age of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace treaty as such , that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received for his merits the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ an@@ ists there is a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ rilla warfare , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were subjected to a war rhet@@ oric and carried around their arms around the clock , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the Colom@@ bian society in turn affects the lives in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , it must now take up into its ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans join and would have to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love bot@@ her@@ es to former guer@@ rilla fighters to welcome them again in the company .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ rilla fighters who are to be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there &apos;s Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to talk short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those who forget that they need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he continued to share his love with people this year he needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; such was the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city management of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art , entered the camp in order to bring the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they did earlier , to counter the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters filled with people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it &apos; was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; &quot; told the political science @-@ student Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ MS &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ illa @-@ fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ rilla war that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to take into account , because next to him on the bed was a m@@ GL @-@ pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter that someone wrote me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , so I rep@@ lied on it . I suddenly got the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him down , and set me next to the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ate light . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be the years of loyal companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hunger strike . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society there that wa@@ its with open arms around us .
until now I just learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students had grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; that is why the leader of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organisation , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years , we have experienced how social injustice by state to evolve into the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this order , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; listening to these people who had never found hearing before and had no choice right , and to realize that people who have often seen as monsters and even hate people who were killed by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage , can give us something and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to their letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
Colom@@ bi@@ anism was prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ armament of peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise up arms and protest for their rights . and this is also entirely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we have now put the F@@ ARC for peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; for this reason we call on all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology belong to them - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in Cau@@ c@@ asian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the coverage of the last months about the persecution of sul@@ ph@@ s men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat that it depends on the dor@@ m LGB@@ T@@ Q community , not only overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual wife from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked to us what happened in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered most of the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports have been published , the under@@ wear , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Ch@@ echn@@ yan authorities , the susp@@ icious que@@ er men and they were carried out in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; already since her childhood , she felt that she was in reality a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she was born , she was aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya learned from the gender equality of their country , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
out of fear for her life they moved to the USA in the end .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a volunteer for a human rights organization .
&quot; one day I was told , that someone needed my help . &quot;
&quot; it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , who put into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from which I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sp@@ ic@@ ked her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round of the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was at present a few shopping bags of the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a voice agree : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to honor the family , you d@@ and@@ y ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had taken everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I drove that I had two key@@ points in my right lungs .
&quot; OC Media : in which medical wings , you have been laid - in the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name , but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was able to do it with fear ; it was a muscular , a cau@@ c@@ asian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he &apos;s respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
in the past February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives .
&quot; the demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
they asked absurd demands : some said to me that I had to prove it by going down without the streets ; others wanted to see that I had not changed my sex in Gros@@ ny and say that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people talked to my mother on the streets .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the whole of the republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she put a stri@@ pe around the neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car covered a car with sli@@ pped windows and a numer@@ ical sign with a 95 dr@@ one . &quot;
once it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was lazy .
my human right @-@ friends over@@ sees the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you have fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons I will not give up their names , but I will say that I remember all of them , they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something im@@ belie@@ vable . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without having to register , without having everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash .
came in and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you &apos;re in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people know already , in which hotel you sto@@ cked . you even know your room@@ mate number . &quot;
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , that is a tab@@ oo theme . &quot;
some traditional cau@@ c@@ asian elements I still wear in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , this spiritual barrier can not be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble to look like the person , to which it reminds himself of their past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke with someone , the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ramad@@ an was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could barely wait , and he closed a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; with this I mean , they probably load the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced by blood . &quot;
OC Media : are also still sw@@ inging men in these secrecy ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine say there was not so many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no wealthy relatives or have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can be present later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; should they be converted , you will show off their bodies on TV and claim them to have attacked your village or a military base . &quot;
understand ?
&quot; as if these people had not simply disappeared , but deliberately under@@ stated to radic@@ alise . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have so far been no reports . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always bore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known throughout Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us back to the &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; &quot; but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were stun@@ ned ; I had colored eyelashes , carried ear jeans and short tail @-@ ops . &quot;
the security Department of Sh@@ aria has never scrat@@ ched a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches was standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been ins@@ ul@@ ted .
in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language there is an phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is said : &quot; sp@@ otte not about the mis@@ fortune of another .
they often say to children when they are going to worry about sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are ill ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
&quot; OC Media : how long kept this grace of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk on TV about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us , but primarily on the behavior of women . &quot;
yet - you could feel like the people in the city began to change .
&quot; who had been stir@@ red up before and woke up , look at once with suspicion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I got back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic was constantly wasted . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t con@@ dense much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicating with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , gather@@ ings , I invite them to hospital and help them to get Essen@@ tial species . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I cur@@ sed this variety .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is silly .
&quot; so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to make you white with foam before the mouth , that there is no spon@@ ge in them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have who , the Kab@@ ard@@ iner , who , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet it is - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is annoying to hear from what to hear . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Caucasus .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque , and during the Ramad@@ an , they live with men . &quot;
&quot; you know , many think in transi@@ tions to men that men love , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be accurate , different circumstances . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will be personally personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know I am myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder in the impover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August reg@@ ained the dist@@ res@@ sing situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to pay the in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ mad @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube , a video posted the moments after he had himself lo@@ oted himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was put into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month had some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ i and Sha@@ wn Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - heard . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family fathers , who felt thanks to the persecution by the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
Arab ancestors suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large majority of the Arab ancestors living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to manage their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took over power and under@@ took all major efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slowly , and the local population gets only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime has denied systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a wide range of roofs , the waters of the Arab @-@ areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have led only to exac@@ erb@@ ate the devast@@ ation in the region , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youths now rose to 81 % .
&quot; our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ General Director for co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , stated that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a job , finished 55 % a secondary school , and 45 % university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im D@@ oh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and racial racial discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise in the number of self @-@ murder among young ancestors . &quot;
D@@ oh@@ im@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse still worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z @-@ new ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
&quot; functional and institutions do not pre@@ dict@@ ate Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will ent@@ ail access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their suburbs and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancestors and to become so called , as even Arabic names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing Arabic . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

why not identifying with femin@@ ism also with inter@@ sec@@ tioning
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I &apos;m not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put a good thought of scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be feminine .
&quot; for example , that women earn less and less money nowadays despite equal education . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women are used sooner or later in various spheres of life to a smooth ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I am double and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , when I come to talk on skin color , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Diaspora , when I mention , as we have always been among se@@ gregation and verbal abuse , both in and outside the feminist movement , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women should come together to up@@ lift their voices and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing to achieve the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alized form of racial or rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women on two @-@ fold species .
&quot; or moreover , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girl and girls with a migration background more often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious problems problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence suffer in the partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I will say that all women , all men and all men of any skin colour have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can consider myself as a black woman with a movement which ref@@ uses the white woman who refuse to refer to the gender and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminine sphere that always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; so@@ oth@@ ner compl@@ ained 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is in historical terms a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I like to join group@@ ings , which also absorb me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to bring white women the importance of the over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was established in order to give women from different homes , and from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself entirely by femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which has been called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that interfer@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author &apos;s author Afri@@ cana up : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which represent the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion when they read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , which is affected by the black woman . &quot;
in a privileged environment I can up@@ lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I think .
I am acknowledged because of my dark skin and due to my being as part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither passed , nor ignored . &quot;
pad@@ dy on the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports a special about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern by Kurdistan in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ proof Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a takes the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water any more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , and multimedia documentary film , filmed and edited . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work lies on persecuted sub@@ cultures , and is distinguished by the use of cooperative video photography and new multi @-@ media techniques , with their help of oppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and demonstrate their rejection . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ ity . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ in@@ ox@@ en ) who reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons involved .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they have nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex @-@ partner who had become non @-@ violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time has passed and the police said , their statement would be placed to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to failure , useful also the ac@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved back their ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women do not even refund , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , sign up at all at the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 blows and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that nothing under@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paraguay is laws : good approach , lack of stro@@ kes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really are mis@@ used , My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for Gen@@ der@@ ask at the Centro de Doc@@ ument@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socialist research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , but not even ans@@ at@@ to show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the numbers available are however alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , the District Court of 9@@ 600 ads went out for domestic violence against domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the adver@@ ts at the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads based on domestic violence in the peac@@ em@@ akers . even here 86 % of the ads of women were killed .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women told that they were physically handic@@ apped , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s Minister in Ana Bai@@ ardi are actually displayed only few of these crimes . &quot; on any woman , which will be re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic failure , come 9 women who do not . &quot;
&quot; every woman who re@@ funded due to physical distr@@ action , come two women who do not do this , &quot; they declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s su@@ icide in Paraguay have no own criminal offen@@ se , the law enforcement authorities may not be appropriately documented , as many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
by August 2016 journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called his name from all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she did not want that , but then there was still . this should not regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but two years long , she carried the mental violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable : &quot;
I had never imagined that I would even become victims of abuse .
&quot; I &apos;ve read earlier about it , I always thought that that only women are happening to be underestimated , because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the distr@@ action by Carlos Vera .
&quot; with no name to name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ical whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of Mis@@ sions had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner used it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group they can talk with others about their experiences , listen and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic failure .
&quot; her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her , she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads at the authorities have remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; it led a trial against their former partners who developed into an un@@ disturbed legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was primarily about money , power , and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of Mis@@ sions is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ one ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
&quot; the original design of the law considers that to explain to an independent criminal record , and to pun@@ ish tougher as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; so the legislative text was changed in some points to also win the MEPs for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are out@@ law@@ ed , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished for up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had planned to carry out the majority of ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which have to wear the victims of violence even if they just want to report and maintain a secure accommodation , to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legis@@ lature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay it is seen as part of human relationships .
&quot; here , a relocation must take place in order that force is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; those who are speaking in the face of these facts is inno@@ cent , and contributes to that the offen@@ ders will get stra@@ it@@ less . &quot;
we have to refund as long as distr@@ action no more than normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was painted , which entered the partners in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning Re@@ conci@@ liation was seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the strike of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is considered a great return . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man still subjected to the prohibition of a newspaper on the prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; this website was locked due to a label of the information minister , &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; homepage was published on the homepage of the forbidden paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ ani authorities have concluded an independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting of corruption in the sult@@ an .
&quot; You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison , where he f@@ aded a year @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and posed to trial , but were later released . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a state coup . &quot;
&quot; since then , he dressed , next to his role as the sole sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Commander of Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Ministers , President of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sult@@ an is marked by the persever@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic service , public freedoms , including freedom of freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , was published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands on the judiciary . it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officers in geri@@ judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure of the Supreme Court in O@@ man to raise judgment in a inheritance . &quot;
&quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties , tie hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , charged the special department from the ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security guards . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 he held the Deputy Chief Editor Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had acts as editor @-@ in @-@ chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; the paper was closed down at un@@ certain time after the information minister had given the directive that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on each other way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first hear@@ ings took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison terms and arranged the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted among other things , due to distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the prestige of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; moreover , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public message and of sl@@ ander@@ ing . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and w@@ ailing greatly in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . a one @-@ year work of employment was also imposed against the two journalists .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a penalty of money in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) , after the use of &quot; &quot; a Information Network to distribute material that could be a threat to public order &quot; &quot; was found guilty . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail was fixed at the level of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released before the custody on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court said to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dischar@@ ged into a prison on 10 April 2017 in the prison quarters of his six month imprisonment . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to prison in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Information Department to close the paper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; .
&quot; in spite of the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n , the paper seems to be suspended , as before attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information received a directive with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Defence asked personally a further instruction , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister announced another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ als , the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man , the press freedom has been violated . &quot;
&quot; for example , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to place their operations . &quot;
&quot; due to the permanent closure of the Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the comprehensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for European authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediate and unconditional release ;
&quot; 2 . a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can go into their work ; &quot;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can make their right human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of deliber@@ ation measures , including geri@@ atric cars . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf Region and the right to gather peace@@ fully , supported and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rs 2016 in Zambia where illustration is done with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need on @-@ site medical research there are two reasons : for the lack of global health care , many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have grown far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rs is Director of the centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors in the center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impacts on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go home back home to support the SÃ¡mi public health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rs discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media regarding this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. War@@ r speaks as a private individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rs RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the SÃ¡mi national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started developing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
GV : what do you think is the important current science themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
r@@ w : there is no basic research here . we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always be able to remain the benefici@@ ary instead of being creators . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are differently supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus , and how can we support development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe us the advantages and draw@@ backs of life as scientists in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; r@@ w : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the lack of access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines are only available to pay for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed manufacturers change worldwide food production
&quot; this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton have already studied the salad since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astron@@ au@@ ts in Space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was made only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many salads can get , borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ aries were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents tend not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resili@@ ence to diseases , a special red or green ton or bent leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants like grain or cart@@ els . due to these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia , Mor@@ ton still calls the salad , but he now needs no longer , because his work is continued by more and more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if in a river there is a rock bro@@ eck , to which I p@@ umped . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far in salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new sal@@ a variety because all the features are already patented . so he is doing as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material being protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International space station ISS have bred red to@@ age of the variety out@@ red@@ ry in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station bred and eaten . there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space .
photo : NASA
&quot; it is no coincidence that this name is rather sound like the movement from the IT area , and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the open source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righted software . &quot;
it was launched into life to ensure that some plant species and -@@ gens are not protected as intellectual property and are usable permanently for plant breeders .
&quot; in the context of the initiative , in short Os@@ si , US bree@@ der is able to commit themselves that others are ready to use seeds free of them . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and they can only buy others who buy their seeds , to breed such own varieties , and it does not immediately spell - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ente . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .

&quot; for the em@@ eal professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seeds , according to seeds , plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by taking seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement did not work with genetically modified crops .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer which are already announced in August and September 2016 . &quot; who is offered good , locally and sustainable producing vegetables in August or September 2016 , should also know that the way that vegetables are cultivated , is threatened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; dietary sovereign without seed sovereign is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the open source Se@@ ed initiative ple@@ dge to make others their seed available free of charge . thus , their approach is opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of the food supply is endangered since the available pool , due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights to plant material , which therefore is always reduced , un@@ neg@@ li@@ gible . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all cart@@ els characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ aging plants like wheat are patented in a large scale than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so bred that they targeted features - of such , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to those they thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of pat@@ rons on plant characteristics indicate that the available pesti@@ cides for breeders are decreasing by more and more patents . genetic diversity is at present however necessary than ever , as the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predicted . &quot;
&quot; in an email , Monsanto spokes@@ in C@@ early Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos . with a total of four genom@@ ics and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company considers the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property rights restric@@ ts other breeders as &quot; patents and the protection of pesti@@ cides innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken on a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes innovation by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees that differently : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , there is certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for so long , to breed on plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources were always been a general public and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what assists us , and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; a total of Mor@@ ton anno@@ yed at the concept of itself , plant features : &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them and as breeders , we ultimately have no idea of how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ arol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si for@@ board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; &quot; those who cultivate a variety , also calls his own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large courts and mon@@ ok@@ ultur@@ ists , for whose cultivation it is required for cultivation , the breeding @-@ breeding is in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those that move on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto are ) patents manage to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile , or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garten sal@@ ates .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that breeders were innovative by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something stronger , stronger than companies . &quot;
&quot; I need a new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is only 20 years ahead of competition , with which one of my opinion is very nice . &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading quickly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program , working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties , meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed , and sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to bree@@ der in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; regulations for breeding differ from country to country , present because of the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , asser@@ ted that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . by this she speaks against the current practice of the European patent pending , the patents on conventional crops are cultivated . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to put this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference to &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seeds from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems building , for the planned next year of the official start @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development activities ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the International Non@@ profit @-@ Development Organization of US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a composite of aid agencies such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have the opportunity to engage in seeds , to exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply can be ensured with food . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that hopes to be recognized by the Lu@@ by from Os@@ si to see him more people soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is especially respected where and how it is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make the people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of cens@@ orship in Egypt
still the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend around 5 August the Egyptian government reports the website of the regional Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August released the network an opinion on Facebook , in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Network for Human Rights Information &quot; &quot; despite this attack and the cont@@ estation of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities to defend their aim to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these objectives . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important to overcome these objectives and do not exist . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities concerned more than two months of 21 web sites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar &apos;s network of Al Jazeera due to alleged &apos; support of terrorism . &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI there is also a access to the blog of colum@@ nis@@ hed and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access in Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now , the blog , which he was directed to deal with the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the purpose of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , such as the police force physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada was vo@@ iced by the government and reflected in what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to block blogs is very old , however , has been a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ u@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block of blogs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to give me the sense of a siege executive ; a arrest , a tried killing , projection on the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web page , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proved that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to handle the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this yiel@@ ded technical tests to networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of suppliers , by converting internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the block of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s started . &quot;
&quot; such practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content , to the Egyptian users could have access . &quot;
&quot; the situation is in addition wor@@ sen that the cens@@ ored decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis so that they can proceed to trial against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

&quot; day for day newspapers report papers from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ ach second day will be a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be rob@@ ben Phar@@ m@@ acy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the current financial situation in Rio has reached the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian government Global Justice and even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; as published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; set up . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the motives for their decision stated the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex , etc . all that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what has happened in Rio in the section &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we should not close our eyes from the cru@@ el@@ ty of our eyes . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war bri@@ k , in a country that does not recognise the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are indications of the Institute for Interior in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
in the editorial the newspaper writes on :
&quot; we are aware that there is a war course , if it is distorted , also to be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots , and then ask questions to cover . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
did the term &quot; war &quot; more than they do ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l argued , the journalist of Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against the violence as a war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility for the police . &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has been demonstrated in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself , in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ confident neglect of public service . &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; the non @-@ violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; is false according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest data available . &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the kill@@ ers of each federal state , Rio is on position 16 , &quot; &quot; writes it . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company of South America , that , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly repe@@ ats the state &apos;s security policy . &quot;
&quot; these safety policy measures also belonged to the foundation of U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one from the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police guide and to stationary a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has led to several reports on ra@@ ils and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor commun@@ es who should actually protect the newly established police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio did not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the designation &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this calls for the state to use the means and ways that are typical of a war . therefore , the intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and is the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; and &quot; mistaken bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war on or her , fact , fact is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ elas in Rio continues to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week it is now that the police reached the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ ho ho , to betra@@ y the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Sy@@ rer learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to wins , a joint initiative of the peace organization P@@ ax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly strongly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the life of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre of the Assad regime was practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , those of rebels controlled areas outside Damascus held under siege , resulted that inhabitants are reli@@ ed on disturbed or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the long @-@ standing block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population . &quot;
a counter @-@ measure teaches a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academics the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas which can plant their own mushroom as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional , traditional food , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food poor makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French message Agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we opted for cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , told Global Vo@@ ices , has been fighting for this project for three years and expressed its relief that it gains more and more &quot; &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 â¬ but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 . September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C , and the humidity is 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of fuel consumption , locally produced fuel from plastic used to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started with &quot; production of &quot; coming from the regions &quot; , &quot; before they tested their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta for free . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of the siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating eating remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , cardboard , etc ) to the extraction of new food . &quot;
&quot; new jobs , especially for women , who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired in crisis @-@ areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were assimil@@ ated in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
&quot; two forty @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ breaks that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country , about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , at Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande occurred a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European fores@@ try system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , alone 2017 in Portugal , about 500,000 hectares of forest alone - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ven@@ tiveness and fire fighting measures through the state .
people asked why the civil protection has not been able to imp@@ el the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of farmers from Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated .
&quot; Sunday , they did this nowhere : there are few reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria would have gone back a similar tragedy as in June , as the roads were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits in Ã@@ r@@ t@@ ances are questioned with high fire risks . &quot;
&quot; a considerable proposal for the whale @-@ form , which had brought the government to serious fires during the years 2003 and 2005 , was of the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law that provided the case by means of the case when the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection , that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; performs JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from easily inflamm@@ able wood , spread as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems arise that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives were offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time via location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina , to simplify the work of fire bri@@ ga@@ des and was so critical at this f@@ ateful weekend in October that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires , not ste@@ ered the website more than half a million . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; during one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had conquered the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan was turned to a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; this time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say so , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in dawn should the boy break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ g@@ boat .

&quot; Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara &apos;s dom@@ ed party to b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
the Taliban known for her hate on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape was found A@@ shar@@ k in Pakistan .
he worked for a few years in a coal mining operation . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left out of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish sa@@ ws with mort@@ ar , who were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees was shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , A@@ shar@@ k rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we made n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t get frozen at night .
after four years A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
&quot; when a dangerous over@@ ride on the sea , he suffered ships and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
after the Greek authorities refused its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k 2002 came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice the day in Essen . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , but it is also true that the conditions , asylum seekers can be found in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the Human Rights Organization for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center , if they have officially paid a request for asylum , which cannot be signed after the registration of the asylum application for months . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible life @-@ wi@@ pe helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k had its total savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he got a second hostel and a schn@@ el@@ lim@@ bis@@ s opened .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venezu@@ elan luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was presented in 2017 for the 24th time . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans operating companies , including cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters , and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s objectives are far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ ic and retail trade and aim back to the country that he had to leave for a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same ways as anyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ per also acc@@ esses plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and processing techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their seriousness in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through insecurity and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af did this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; neo @-@ report : Legisl@@ ative accus@@ ations from Egypt enable de@@ preci@@ ation of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , who has been in custody for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clear@@ ance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament verified a draft law , which pre@@ dict that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to be able to use the social networks within six months , within six months of successful legislation on the website of providing their full name as well as its identification number . &quot;
those who miss this step might be sentenced to up to six months sentence or the final payment of pen@@ alties .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently under legislative and constitutional Committee of Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , a further Member of the Council held a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tougher sanctions for the ins@@ ult of the president or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ul@@ ing of the President as well as state institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the law proposition a such act would be punished with jail and money tigh@@ tening , so right expert of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , it can mean up to three years in prison for the contract . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstrated Egyptian poli@@ cem@@ an , demonstrated against the demonstr@@ ators who fought against the military put@@ sch who had led to the bai@@ li@@ fication of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as did more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in detention on a court appointment . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial moved on 20 May , because the prison instruction was postponed to human rights groups , to bring the accused of prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree on the exposure of among other weapon @-@ ownership , illegal Assembly , murder and tried of murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza was free the two journalists H@@ any sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activists to sc@@ anned documents
&quot; in May , Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia which co @-@ founder of independent media platforms Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily se@@ duc@@ ed by the President of the Republic , which was explicitly supported by the President of the Republic , the former business@@ men and during the former regime , by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Ab@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption accused Am@@ nesty , provided that these are all un@@ lawful preserv@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; this document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the pre@@ dominant plans to support the legislation . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia with@@ drew the disclosure of its sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisian authorities , which journalists have the right to protect their sources . &quot;
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May . may be a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to submit their credit card ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Information Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need a permit before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the regulations , it is also stated that the registration will be required with the full re@@ tin@@ ent name . &quot;
analy@@ st suggest that Eli@@ mination of anonymous comments should be achieved in discussions within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese ma@@ ins have proposed in the social media to enforce these schemes only in order to protect citizens of journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or dre@@ amy We@@ Chat , to register at the national government as the &quot; organizer of the information @-@ proliferation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government manages a list of online services that allows the &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to accept the services responsible for removing content and force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;

&quot; it is the first time Turkey has blocked the site completely . it is therewith China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
