<seg id="1">"although I visited the US for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American films, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had profound effects on me, that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, which covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-student, who had the Supreme Court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man, 'me' s as if that is the absolute truth, everything else is, that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the US."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you are always the one you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I was even written a very darkest sense letter over his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and the racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his bottiness."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never holds his opinion behind the mountain, how one says so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it, and openly explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won at the Republican pre-elections, was the highest number that ever reached by the party nominees."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotilla person asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was unable to reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, like my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist program, who takes people from all over the world, a deep believer that I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he did not agree with the" Cincinnati Inquirer "by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"umps Intolerant is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy, who fights for life long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with a lot of patience and grace, and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embodied my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump his way to the nominees Republican presidential data, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the examination of the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, I broke out almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the callump-voters as a racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and points to understand the inability to understand those who act in another way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most of them are, for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that in this America they are still important?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who has commented on the cruel decision to look down a man who looks different with contempt to those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(fig. WC.: as much as" "dence of the White against all other ethnics"; word game from white in swelling to the whites and whiplash, which means so much like Shanddertrauma), as was the big Van Jones, has exactly killed what America has done so great. "</seg>

<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and all the concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who was fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd.</seg>

<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>

<seg id="59">"the land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps land, said the message."</seg>

<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and the banana violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hopelessness."</seg>

<seg id="86">"in an article of Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez is reminded of a local economist and musician instructor for children of Cateura, at the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication is within the context of an agreement with Global Voices to use content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then well-known that this ship had already operated in liberated waters of illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were accordingly raised by this, and little inclined to welcome a Legislative of this kind on their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they were offended to him one of their harbours and refused to give him a fisherman of fishing."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Uri was a prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply did everything "," Benedict Kiilu recalls the keness of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship time and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and protecting resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand out each other where it's about illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, present because it is extremely difficult to match. therewith, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing in regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the intentional misrespect of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while campaigns against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the blickentempo, with the information between individual countries, so the actions occur in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, using satellite rates."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify vessels that fish in banned areas - such as suspicious driving routes - such as such, indicate that a ship will travel his caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishery license, where they were on the road and possibly also, whether they have a code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse the adoption of such ships in their harbours. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they may even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" it's then about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable. "</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a counselling company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD of lost sales, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishermen who invade Eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisherman who moves to commercial fishing from around the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"amongst other things, actions include as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indication of fantasienames, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature reserve."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they are deliberately taking advantage of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-mosquito control system, "says Long." "sooner a ship could be illegally fishing and a country could then say 'you daring to run my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" Come to me "." "and exactly this legale loops tried to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed Front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks exposed to counterfeit licenses used in Tanzania. it discovered vessels that used several fraudulent identities and it has been tracked and found volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that is to help FISH-i, suspects ships more precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to split the illegal vessels that are fond of hiding."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position. and that's what we try to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat tracking, a NGO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships also switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be considered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system, which combines different information levels. it is supposed to help FISH-i with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite views and can be displayed worldwide by the position of every single trackable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" gather mentun with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing, this is simply meaning "," he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project to run, in which a global system permits the pursuit of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but they also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that consumed previously without a license and hardly to reckon with consequences will know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have reached a 33% increase in fishing sales since fishing boats can buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 erect, the inspectors found there on board tow networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these achievements." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa there are several hundred million dollars every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries have joined together, so called the West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "with certainty, the aim is to create even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions too," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country could report on his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was on the road under false flag. and not only was the ship also without a license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into the forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of the rules against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works throughout the cosmos.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to survive, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and to transmit active language skills to transfer him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native language. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the primary language - native language."</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French native language should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as a mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this might be lacking in understanding of the surplus, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers, the Japanese language."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have any foreign employees, let translations have been acquired internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is made as the best one, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the verbatirens and puzzling phrases that arise by machine translation, show that this technique can still be replaced by a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages quite particularly."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English wordings in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. however, by major companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"hopefully, the City Kyoto is hoping to use a reputable source for their translations in the future."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a etprefectures in Japan's northeast, which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring part of Fukushima and Iwates were acuated, because the tsunami had vanished whole coastal cities of the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"at Fukushima, the prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, which alone had to leave 160 000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress made six years later, in order to re-establish the lives of the local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authorities as well as survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (including the local, saigai kouei juutchu) in the Prefect Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures was given miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has finished 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is up to 70 percent in the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, one still makes every effort to settle six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of housing shelters (to be in force, cascsu juutaku) in final spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw to live in comfort shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwates lived in such containers."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima in 2011 were still alive in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated ones lived after the disaster into housing shelters, were settled in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, there have been 1074 from 1100 schools that were affected by evil, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fisheries in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, at Fukushima only 30 percent of fisheries have been rerecorded their operations."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, have drawn large-scale in the three prefectures of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="564">"in 93 percent of agricultural land areas, Miyagi could recover only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate, and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear unusually, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farmlands of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered in detail but also here Fukushima back far off."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same stand, as before the misfortune. Fukushima however can only have 75 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to feel their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to obtain an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and evacuated by the evacuated. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how it has changed over the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo introduced a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey conducted that 83.1 percent of the resident resident inhabitants, have taken action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of the respondents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">"as it is about those who had to evacuate from the Fukushima prefecture,"</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue to the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung raised their attention also to the situation of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima fecture was a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident, the Japan ever."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from Fukushima from Fukushima nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in lasting spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the date of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in disaster areas, most of the evacuated areas are older than 50 years old. they have to come back in proper containers because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games that are taking place in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10 year-old cousin thinks that he is scarco (German: drug dealers) will be when he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is, as if they drown out those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happened to them too."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are led to mere numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the tightening of 43 students were justified in a neighbor place to be justified that they were indivisible.</seg>

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one of violence drawn."</seg>

<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"it is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>

<seg id="805">"however, they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for all life out of violence and had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>

<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>

<seg id="813">These are just a few of the centuries-ending stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"a few stories still live on new headlines, but this project reminds us of those that we must not forget."</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the count of stories in their original language a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Untouchable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written ones but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be given to the children."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that may not forget diversity - safe spaces where people do not forget who they are, to belong to."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while, listen often with it is to understand" "these events instead" "listen to the listening, to cherish, to establish."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, story tellers will first express their story in their own language and then translate them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation may be given to the audience."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They may call laugh and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows for example a traditional history of Burkina Faso, who is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate will also be the opportunity to explain the relatives of the narrative."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the Fabel from the Hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after he explains the importance of his Fabel, John Nyamusara becomes asked:" how is this to speak to a public that does not understand your language? "with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytellers."</seg>

<seg id="1193">"his name was painted from the list of Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title" "collective remembrance" "gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom."</seg>

<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and Digital activist has been in prison for Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and Ombudsperson Noura Ghazi reported that the" Military Police "was based on a basis of a" "strictly secret" "command of military bases from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented himself as insider of the Assad's government, and they took note of an alleged death part against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his residence and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to the general public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project founded in Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was the work that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins Palmyra virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the cruising of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would take everything to know that architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strikes in digital archeology and conservation has created a time capsel, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"ironically, Bassel could not conclude this project until now."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison,"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel brought me English at me, even when he was already in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read and speak English well, to write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked, he has taught other incarcerated, to write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">"Bassel opened to me the door to the technology. he taught me, both computers and smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he has also taught other prisoners, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of orphan (waiting) to a prosabotage which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>

<seg id="1260">"however, many people are not doing the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integrated de Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the German wave to re-establish the director to the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a backward step towards the efforts of our legal system, the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have a disciplinaring process against the reluctant.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company was apparently able to put an appropriate legal steps for the application of the respective functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambique social media, rejects this behavior as well and considers the case as' warmed ':"</seg>

<seg id="1267">"he could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and his image polishing."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be integrated into the company, which he helped to cause damage."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook is blocking the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmical word "Kalar Pae" means masonry or sauté.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known Social Network took their posts from the net, because they dismissed the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to humans ostindian origin or generally used as an adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or the whole of the party, (in burmesan writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma into the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely abrupt connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically calling for hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use of use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burmesic words with the different meanings which have the same code as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmically also 'Kalar htaing' written what the same letters contain, as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (butterfly), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">"a post of one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in spiritual way whether she knew how he could relieve his back pain by making a word play."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmically - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that the speech of hate speech will reduce radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical, before making all Posts Lösche, which are in suspicion against racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on facbeers.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar Pae" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these drecky nationalists, spread the hate speech, got a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtailed their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that may send hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often will begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of censored Word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, as Facebook began to delete his posts as he wanted to communicate his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use the light, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" "Facebook community standards did not speak."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts from people who have no negative intentions or who are simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmical Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to censor becomes even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"moreover it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support, and so words like" "chair" "or" "pevercurry" "have banned."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the falsically deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, this would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship is provided for a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now taking part of Facebook and consciously writing the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their postings are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts, who have no hate speech but still removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and take a pevercurry and look at an Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks shall cause the violence in the communities in Myanmar, in addition to heating, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook was criticised for his failure, the exhilarating hate speech on his burmesical sides under control."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but rather than simply to censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better ongoing to have looked at the context rather than on code focused initiatives and learned about them."</seg>

<seg id="1522">"during the last few months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang about things about which they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things, for example how our identities have been made to our spouses, never so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things noisy, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have supported only Saris since their marriage.</seg>

<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but then listened to the name of her husband's husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now contribute to their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the panel say that the changes they want to achieve in their lives, like the polish for more freedom of movement, or their own clothes choice - at the end of a hard to navigating the river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>

<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families only. there will be a chain reaction when every woman in the club goes home and told other people what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear silly as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the law of the law of the State of New York, the Minister of the State of New York noticed that many people criticized the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody has questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, with most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," to rotate the logic to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country, we hear that we are ultimately no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, what country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons for Shanmugam were not very clamble: he defended an idea, according to which the political system of Singapore could not be measured with other 'normal countries', given that he seemed inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently managed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old Leier from authoritarian machinations appears to be the preacher logic, leaving the twisted logic as it adapts better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end of the last week of Shanmugam, the answers were given to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answer."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant questions - he shared with non-responses rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our precious K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point where he was paid highly, in order to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog his comment, he pointed to the reviews that one should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference, so that we can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore is more of a" city "as a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He used Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said, Singapore" "is not a country," he obviously does not mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is as leader of a growing generation, that makes such polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expect - do I agree with them or not, but that is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it, properly and aware what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review destroys the weaknesses of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "believing a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>

<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the mexican town of Tapachula, it is located at the border with Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59- year-year Mexickanerin, a little woman with a coral pink brick-knell and goldcolored ear rings in Teddy Bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born there in Tapachula. nevertheless, they know many of the names of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">The nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on cartons outside."</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston in order to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normally a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other pioneers of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and the Afrikaner often talk together the route and that the Afrikaner already speak at Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companion, Michelet previously lived in Brazil and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he has started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to purchase the bus ticket."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we will never leave her again," he answered smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that her guests will often send text messages when they continued to grate them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, there was a dead end up to Jesús of Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"in this winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their little house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus flight tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered to them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooker out there."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived there for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze the money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, a single-known, has offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"some months later, the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travellers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has got 20 new guests a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgically, because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">She looks like a proud grandmother in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there are one of her daughter with African hair care that has made her a rally, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old."</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install on their mobile phones a surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, to the local,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities in Western China, are forced to install a Spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile phone, in which it indicates the District Government, a surveillance app called Jingvang (or" "Web cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, the app is said that the app is to get access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the app will also use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed just after they installed the app, messages with a private Wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police stood that the app would identify and follow the sources and distribution routes of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingvang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the block pornography web pages, from online fraud, Trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" "remote control" "government actors or even hackers could be able to manipulate the home network of a person or to steal from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often grimmer for those who live in remote, suppressed ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit disturbances and dissatisfaction in conflict-areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censored and monitoring measures as well as routinely-gluteal Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter-based Media-Outlet" Images from Mainland China "(in force, respectively), the censored news in China showed photos from a checkpoint, at the police officers or unchecked whether they have installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingvang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile message slows that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"you have forced the people to use devices, which are intended for older people."</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (which, in force) released a Jingvang product description, out of which the software can lift the passwords of a Windows operating system and therefore get full access to the hard disk of the computer. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingvang, computers and cellphones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"the provisions in Jingvang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and associated institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office to operate their computer and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a current report by Freedom House, an American Human Rights organization, also mentioned this new monitoring methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their" personal ID-cards, mobiles, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards.

<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action does hurt the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and give them penalties for quite a number of other possible failures, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political communications."</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to feel good or used to get used to it, although I had done nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this loving "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe, which is probably from the cloaks. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner is rejoiced at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold your cry out."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cry did not turn it yet enough, so they exchanged the pipe by a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first celebration, I asked whether the investigator had worked as a trash collection earlier or whether that was the normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables intertwined with each other to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them rarely changed, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I heard hearing."</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling and did not find any favor for it to be an electrically invited rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Flow floss my whole body enough to supply my entire neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-baked body that lay out on the floor was the perfect raph.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep again, let's say that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours left, which came to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the jordian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spend most of his time inside, times he strolling on his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"what you can leave however, a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine lips can be discovered."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which had heard them since 1967; the year, in which Israel ended its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks her long-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality, and freedom of expression through art and rapidity."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but it also calls the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues do not only find in his hometown Amman relevance but also in cities that come from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as anyone who is not restricted in his mind, and he may have compassion on his own statement by men who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it openly, he violates a special disagreement against the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war-areas to do something with his identity as a" Palestinian "volatile of the second generation, even if he was born in Jordan and never before has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life circumstances," stressed Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I shook a man, while he shook into two cups in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is meant for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordian law also states that public consumption is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sened hot young ag have little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the sleeves are talking about hot coffee and the Schwaden of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first and foremost by freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if one throws a look at neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it's easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens has said an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliament MPs, which support the Islamic activist - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier Hamed Sinno, which contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert tables."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also assert that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that poses the long-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement of Mashrou'Leila the jordian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continued to use" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably does not simply be just seizing rhetoric, but actually a more evident crystallized reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaibstone's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards to body, having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre-marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a apparently crushed unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, the number of" Honmormorde 'has risen in Jordan - the unofficial outside. "</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honmormorde reached its peak in 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure lacks enough to aid the women who tried the victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime control from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence" "should often be held in prison for years, and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family that woman will not happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity, and is known also not to shy away from topics that in his country has long been taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Mr Hdaib dispute that his work is politically, is, however, that he is his music, the full explicit illations on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I became a policy", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lavla al 3aib" "and" "Ghareeb" "is the focus again on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs that are in the core are political, can continue."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words," that is what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians, and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored up in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya to notice that his comments from the context were ripped, revolves and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib will acquires Hdaib open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which has remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was later on behalf of the Caliph, was able to write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier this not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks the freedom of expression, and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordian intelligence service assumed several former government members and members of the magisterium, with the reason they had expressed critical on comments in social media, which are deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"considering this, the concert of Hdaibs is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has expired Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it seems that Hdaib - is made of slow, printed and internal changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Israeli society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only to bring his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is coming through music, art and literature a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams and on artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is done, Hdaib will proceed and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which belongs to the Aman as a student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the revised version of the paper" "Liebesmessage to guerrilla fighters", "which has published international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important to give people who are extinct, caring?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely this question left the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Repository liación (letters to reconciliation) that young people exiled to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, her country was a place on a historical event and they wanted to do their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian Government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Forces of Colombia), which forms the postage of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was considered the signatories of the peace treaty as such, that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received for his merits the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombianists there is a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were subjected to a war rhetoric and carried around their arms around the clock, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"in turn, the Colombian society in turn affects the lives in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred towards guerrilla warfare, it must now take up into its ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians join and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love botheres to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters who are to be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there's Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those who forget that they need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he continued to share his love with people this year he needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"such was the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me "</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city management of Cali and Leonardo of the Foundation BogotArt, entered the camp in order to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC set themselves up as they did earlier, to counter the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters filled with people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it 'was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between, "" told the political science-student Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" CamMS "(a kind of hut in which the guerilla-fighters live), I saw a guerrilla war that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to take into account, because next to him on the bed was a mGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the thorns."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said," "hello, what do they do?" "he answered," I answered a letter that someone wrote me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, so I replied on it. I suddenly got the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him down, and set me next to the pomegranate light."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be the years of loyal companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. to join the FARC, the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hunger strike." I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there that waits with open arms around us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"that is why the leader of the FARC explained the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years, we have experienced how social injustice by state to evolve into the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"listening to these people who had never found hearing before and had no choice right, and to realize that people who have often seen as monsters and even hate people who were killed by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage, can give us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to their letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombianism was prophesied that after the disarmament of peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise up arms and protest for their rights. and this is also entirely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we have now put the FARC for peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"for this reason we call on all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology belong to them - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring victims, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he's respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">In the past February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - Related, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the demanded to return to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me that I had to prove it by going down without the streets; others wanted to see that I had not changed my sex in Grosny and say that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people talked to my mother on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the whole of the republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a devout woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she put a stripe around the neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car covered a car with slipped windows and a numerical sign with a 95 drone."</seg>
<seg id="2295">Once it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right-friends oversees the numerical signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you have fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons I will not give up their names, but I will say that I remember all of them, they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something imbelievable."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without having to register, without having everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came in and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you do not believe, you're in security, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people know already, in which hotel you stocked. you even know your roommate number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equality, that is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional caucasian elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this spiritual barrier can not be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble to look like the person, to which it reminds himself of their past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke with someone, the one and a half months in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could barely wait, and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this I mean, they probably load the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced by blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also still swinging men in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine say there was not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no wealthy relatives or have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there so that they can be present later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "should they be converted, you will show off their bodies on TV and claim them to have attacked your village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people had not simply disappeared, but deliberately understated to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this now just a mutation, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now, they were not presented as bandits, there have so far been no reports. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" nontraditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always bore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known throughout Grosny when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us back to the" "civil society" "but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were stunned; I had colored eyelashes, carried ear jeans and short tail-ops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security Department of Sharia has never scratched a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches was standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechnya language there is an phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is said: "spotte not about the misfortune of another.</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they are going to worry about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed you are ill?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">"OC Media: how long kept this grace of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk on TV about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us, but primarily on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Yet - you could feel like the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had been stirred up before and woke up, look at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I got back home, I could sense how the situation in the Republic was constantly wasted."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't condense much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicating with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, gatherings, I invite them to hospital and help them to get Essential species."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I cursed this variety.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to make you white with foam before the mouth, that there is no sponge in them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have who, the Kabardiner, who, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is annoying to hear from what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque, and during the Ramadan, they live with men."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think in transitions to men that men love, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be accurate, different circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will be personally personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know I am myself.</seg>

<seg id="2402">"he suffered under anxiety, depression, and he ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to pay the inability for his family, such as Ahmad-human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"on YouTube, a video posted the moments after he had himself looted himself."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people managed to delete the flames again, and Moramazi was put into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month had some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussai and Shawn Bani Tamim - heard."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: it was all family fathers, who felt thanks to the persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and incapable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>

<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large majority of the Arab ancestors living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to manage their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-Monarchy took over power and undertook all major efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to grow slowly, and the local population gets only little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and hardships."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime has denied systematic jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry."</seg>

<seg id="2433">Why not identifying with feminism also with intersectioning</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide and originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I'm not feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectionale feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put a good thought of scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be feminine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women earn less and less money nowadays despite equal education."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women are used sooner or later in various spheres of life to a smooth ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, when I come to talk on skin color, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women women, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I mention, as we have always been among segregation and verbal abuse, both in and outside the feminist movement, decide to mention many white feminists and white intersectionale feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women should come together to uplift their voices and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing to achieve the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about sexualised violence an institutionalized form of racial or racist violence that we are exposed to black women on two-fold species.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or moreover, black women and women of other ethnicities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls with a migration background more often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious problems problems. "</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence suffer in the partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I will say that all women, all men and all men of any skin colour have the same rights; on the other hand, I can consider myself as a black woman with a movement which refuses the white woman who refuse to refer to the gender and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminine sphere that always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"soothner complained 1851 in her speech:" "I am not a woman?" and also I refuse to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman is in historical terms a dehumanized and marginalized being. "</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I like to join groupings, which also absorb me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to bring white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectionale feminism was established in order to give women from different homes, and from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself entirely by feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which has been called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that interferality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres which are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author's author Africana up: Reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which represent the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectionale feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion when they read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, which is affected by the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a privileged environment I can uplift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I think.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am acknowledged because of my dark skin and due to my being as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither passed, nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," says Musa. "</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and processed version of article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by curity. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weightinoxen) who reported on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez, that they have nothing against Luis Balbuena, their ex-partner who had become non-violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time has passed and the police said, their statement would be placed to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"a further woman Balbuena due to failure, useful also the actenant display of Ada Báez nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved back their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women do not even refund, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, sign up at all at the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 blows and Statistical 2 Unvisible Missions and a legal system that nothing undermmt3 Paraguay is laws: good approach, lack of strokes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women really are misused, Myrian González, researcher for Genderask at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socialist research institution in Paraguay." there are various indications and reports, but not even ansatto show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Court of 9600 ads went out for domestic violence against domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the adverts at the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads based on domestic violence in the peacemakers. even here 86% of the ads of women were killed.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women told that they were physically handicapped, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayischen women's Minister in Ana Baiardi are actually displayed only few of these crimes." on any woman, which will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychic failure, come 9 women who do not. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman who refunded due to physical distraction, come two women who do not do this," they declared at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide in Paraguay have no own criminal offense, the law enforcement authorities may not be appropriately documented, as many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 journalists were at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2531">"the original design of the law considers that to explain to an independent criminal record, and to punish tougher as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia."</seg>
<seg id="2532">"so the legislative text was changed in some points to also win the MEPs for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions are outlawed, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished for up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill had planned to carry out the majority of (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which have to wear the victims of violence even if they just want to report and maintain a secure accommodation, to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>

<seg id="2589">"for the need on-site medical research there are two reasons: for the lack of global health care, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have grown far more serious effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there is no basic research here. we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always be able to remain the beneficiary instead of being creators."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are differently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>

<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe us the advantages and drawbacks of life as scientists in Africa towards Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine, about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton have already studied the salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astronauts in Space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was made only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salads can get, borders."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salaries were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents tend not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resilience to diseases, a special red or green ton or bent leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants like grain or cartels. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia, Morton still calls the salad, but he now needs no longer, because his work is continued by more and more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if in a river there is a rock broeck, to which I pumped."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go far in salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new sala variety because all the features are already patented. so he is doing as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and strives to use no material being protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name is rather sound like the movement from the IT area, and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the open source Seed initiative (initiative for" open source "seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched into life to ensure that some plant species and -gens are not protected as intellectual property and are usable permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, in short Ossi, US breeder is able to commit themselves that others are ready to use seeds free of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and they can only buy others who buy their seeds, to breed such own varieties, and it does not immediately spell - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patente."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeal professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member, Jack Kloppenburg are control over seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seeds, according to seeds, plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by taking seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement did not work with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer which are already announced in August and September 2016." who is offered good, locally and sustainable producing vegetables in August or September 2016, should also know that the way that vegetables are cultivated, is threatened. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "dietary sovereign without seed sovereign is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the open source Seed initiative pledge to make others their seed available free of charge. thus, their approach is opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argue that the future of the food supply is endangered since the available pool, due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights to plant material, which therefore is always reduced, unnegligible."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all cartels characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates, but experts like Luby suspect that massaging plants like wheat are patented in a large scale than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they targeted features - of such, through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to those they thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patrons on plant characteristics indicate that the available pesticides for breeders are decreasing by more and more patents. genetic diversity is at present however necessary than ever, as the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predicted."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email, Monsanto spokesin Cearly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monsantos. with a total of four genomics and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company considers the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property rights restricts other breeders as" patents and the protection of pesticides innovations. "" a patent is basically taken on a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes innovation by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, there is certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for so long, to breed on plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources were always been a general public and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what assists us, and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"a total of Morton annoyed at the concept of itself, plant features:" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea of how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi forboard member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" "those who cultivate a variety, also calls his own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large courts and monokulturists, for whose cultivation it is required for cultivation, the breeding-breeding is in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (those that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents manage to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile, or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garten salates.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders were innovative by the Avoid of plant patrons:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something stronger, stronger than companies. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years," he says. "with a patent it is only 20 years ahead of competition, with which one of my opinion is very nice."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be leading in the" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading quickly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a" open source "seed program, working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties, meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" open source "seed, and sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the Deutsche Bank Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission, asserted that conventional plants should not be patentable. by this she speaks against the current practice of the European patent pending, the patents on conventional crops are cultivated."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; it is now in the governments of the Member States to put this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference to" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and seeds from all over East Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>

<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that hopes to be recognized by the Luby from Ossi to see him more people soon."</seg>

<seg id="2721">Still the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">"this time, it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend around 5 August the Egyptian government reports the website of the regional Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"August released the network an opinion on Facebook, in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the" "Network for Human Rights Information" "despite this attack and the contestation of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities to defend their aim to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these objectives. ANHRI has never been so important to overcome these objectives and do not exist. we insist on fulfilling our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities concerned more than two months of 21 web sites, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-speaking edition of Huffington Post and that from Qatar's network of Al Jazeera due to alleged 'support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columnists and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity, after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video, such as the police force physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada was voiced by the government and reflected in what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to block blogs is very old, however, has been a priority in the era of Abdeluah al-Sisi; and even if the block of blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been able to give me the sense of a siege executive; a arrest, a tried killing, projection on the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proved that I did not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to the post of articles to handle the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th we noticed how the block of web pages that VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content, to the Egyptian users could have access."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is in addition worsen that the censored decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis so that they can proceed to trial against these actions."</seg>
