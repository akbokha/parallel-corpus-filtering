this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize for the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
&quot; long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular , that the NSA was illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , in which the CIA had literally dra@@ gged dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter was not coinci@@ ded ?
the U.S. government .
almost 10 years the government has been determined against corruption and urged him to name its alleged sources .
&quot; in this train , he became the symbol of the pattern of government , wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ te that they do .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked out with R@@ isen , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters already did before him , he refused , and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen living in prison by the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; however , just days before the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had years of details that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government in R@@ isen were dropped . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide themselves less . &quot;
&quot; instead of having to fail and bring R@@ isen to the statements , that also could do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators will be concerned without his consent , his phone references . &quot;
&quot; just as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its loans , and even travel letters , with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to denoun@@ ce Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ked source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect against his attack , wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much stu@@ ffed up from her work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ gging to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ ade all . &quot;
&quot; but just like the technology of the government is allowed to use the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they are able to contact the moment in which they are in contact , rather than in the after@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that has not yet been written as a book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source system for wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet of famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , which has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation when I &apos;m working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there , you can upload or send documents to you , just like any regular contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , that only the particular news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ y technologies that threaten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to make sure that not only technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to give distr@@ action . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the lack of abuse about the supply of soldiers knows and reported from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm goes to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a pilgri@@ m in@@ sider warned that we warned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ak of history was published &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers , &quot; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness about one explanation . &#93; this week we have been found by messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Bar Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosel Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
also there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s stamp in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of richer people and others who are nervous on the next release , and on the next un@@ veiled documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of a agency &apos;s P@@ lot or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems crying out of you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tackle this ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by a few minutes to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appearing this whole world very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ ker .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports of this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far , in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle after which this tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ Bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data center of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to have connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states you need less information to give less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian . &quot;
&quot; this kind of in@@ transpar@@ ence in the United States allows employees of bor@@ ough@@ s to aver@@ t school children . &quot;
it has sc@@ amm@@ ers allowed to cut off especially suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does that actually work ?
&quot; so , we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself the African minister to buy the suspected money in the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked ourselves , that all of them made on an attorney to our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all happ@@ enings . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has made suggestions of our inter@@ woven investig@@ ators .
&quot; it is not about a single top @-@ political , involved in sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to overcome this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound all very comfor@@ ting as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing has ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency towards greater transparency in the past few years , as regards the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU is captured in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people , who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ companies . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which get up and say , &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ence is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians to recognise the problem and use them , by laws this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally end the lack of transparency , which now allow this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
this is the story as I had almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and had landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ bow . &quot;
a guy in red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my belon@@ gings .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and made a road trip through all the land . after that , he would go on to the peace of peace . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it became late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where are you asleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says , he would go to peac@@ eb@@ or@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to get kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ ar . &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; I have an air conditioner . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; Come , how to please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I started at the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I make a broken ? &quot;
a wild alien in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I was such a fear that I got out of bed , on toe @-@ pointed to the door , and my sleep @-@ room door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he bought from me is hanging in his classroom . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accom@@ o@@ date people on my air mattress , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; do we make a time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ted , my room@@ mates , and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can make it possible to turn fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I persu@@ aded how we could earn something about it . our apartment is going to be a designer bed and a desk including , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we asked a website and so @-@ called &quot; air @-@ rats and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happ@@ i@@ est guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars .
&quot; they found it super , and we also found . &quot;
I &apos;m sure our cheese mar@@ ham O@@ mel@@ ts totally different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all the city . as we farewell our last guest and fell the door to the castle , Brian and I went to the castle . &quot;
we have just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent at the same time ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website based on people public pictures of their private spaces , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind rooms , whose doors are closed when you visit . &quot;
over the Internet they can then invite wild@@ ly people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still in comfort , would invest in a shop , the stranger is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; when you have a problem , one thinks on the things that one can be well . we could design . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
&quot; we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create trust by design immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a precious tasting , which degree can we care . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ sper@@ sed cell phone to your left seat of seat .
panic that you feel right now -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door first time .
&quot; for the only thing , which is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the horri@@ fying cell phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so do most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just once , who now has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ? &quot;
could you pro@@ claim on Twitter that he dict@@ ates to the Office of the President ?
you can now return the cell@@ phones now .
you now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail at this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would have imagined with his name , if he would have told where he is coming , like his dog or children ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 Be@@ ur@@ als who all say : &quot; he can really hold very well cl@@ ed phones !
how would you feel when you need to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ trained feedback system strengthens the confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to throw up negative assessments .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their findings before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have done with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are at age and residence . &quot;
little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most like most .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
exciting happens when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three ratings , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , it changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation sti@@ ckers com@@ mon@@ alities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we found that trust is dependent on how much you get there . &quot;
here you see the reaction to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you have too little told how for example &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; tell you a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- - the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; king art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create design with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give advice on which subjects you should write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
&quot; with what we had not reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these prejudices . &quot;
here you see how many people will take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second : the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that was not covered before . &quot;
for us the business is just very good .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate parties or homes .
host have guests in the rain stand .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing more lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it already hur@@ ts when I think only about it .
&quot; the disappointment that one h@@ ears in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , there had only a fraction of the 123 million made nights only a fraction per problem . &quot;
for people entrusted each other to law .
&quot; when trust works , it can be Wonder@@ ful . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
it even ended blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , which tend to be heart @-@ coloured due to sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guards who save life , even though they do not know each other . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can even stay longer without paying the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay will run .
but these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is here about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just to mention &quot; the lease &quot; , the thing is not justified . &quot;
&quot; share Economy describes a trade , the human relationships promises . &quot;
&quot; people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when one travels nowadays , this is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would be , however , if travelling a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you visit , a group there would wait to wait a group there to show a thoroughly rin@@ se and to show a pub in a pub that one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to shape apartments from ground up to co @-@ sharing ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would take up the thought of a joint share ?
I imagine cities that allow ourselves to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places that belonged to the government , &quot;
&quot; were now offered by residents . students who were looking for a place , &quot;
were taught to people whose children were taken out . there were In@@ cub@@ ator programs .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , there will be € 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries with a stranger or even host . &quot;
the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there have been similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we see that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
I find the start@@ ling
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we of course know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you see me ?
a believer ? a Exper@@ t@@ ess ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or sup@@ pressed , a brain @-@ la@@ undering , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay on the check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media shows people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
presumably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Moslems , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ er @-@ Fitness fan@@ atics
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , for , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose to bear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you think you yourself ?
&quot; the L@@ ily was : at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence , and with the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tainable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought after , exhibited in question , doub@@ ted and thought ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication based on every reading of the grain .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I recognize myself in this . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever had the feeling that someone you truly perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understand , and yet somehow love ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I later had , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had at the end , looked at the screen and looked the word &quot; E@@ il@@ message . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ un out of the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into rebellion .
why should we do something ?
&quot; I moved to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked my country , but in the N@@ u , the works of others converted me from another of citizenship into a susp@@ icious one . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove in silence -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; ble@@ w in well lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ eth not you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then there was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims gather for prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; do not go to this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims , went outside and struck . &quot;
there was really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because the people who were attacked this country , attacked our country . &quot;
I have fu@@ elled the anger of people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations which are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to connect Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the United States .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only available under review .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first aid and Olympi@@ as . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques in America make more secure ?
&quot; it may keep a few parking available , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit to a mosque leads to consider people of other faith tolerant , and to show greater citizenship . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington D.C. , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , you have noticed that he starts online . as a first , the person from her community is cut off , even from her family , so that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ears their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to avoid radic@@ alization , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; after all , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as man , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u frac@@ ture with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when you cast a look at it , it is not driving what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is its brut@@ ality that they can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had imagined to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke she brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given its anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extremis@@ ts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m turned the connection to God and its community again .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept it to join the IS . &quot;
that was an insight as the Islam@@ ophobia and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show when we fear , pass at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian governance system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if one reports out testing messages , which is negative about Muslims , they agreed to rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look , when the mood against Muslims sh@@ ook up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to mosquito @-@ terror as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has sensible and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early War@@ n@@ sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear ow@@ es us all .
&quot; with the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ation , it is not just about having to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athle@@ te .
&quot; he was attended by the dental surgery , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her life . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is of my quarry have become such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne &apos;s brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had visited the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with an execution after he posted expressions against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he oss eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we loved it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove in silence , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went to prayer sh@@ alle , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m did an announcement , thank you and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers , and non @-@ believers who have come to attack us , but to stand with us . &quot;
at this moment I am broken .
these people were there because they have gone courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what do you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to make sure ?
or will you join those that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks nice !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who may perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a den@@ ker@@ in with deep @-@ access are , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dec@@ eive you . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my history is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever carried out study to Moslems all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am not an exception in any respect .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then the rule is often broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , it is about to become a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air parcel entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France live in front of audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
through inter@@ connecting passengers high speed and acceleration in the narrow space .
you can also build self @-@ constantly bur@@ dened structures .
they have learned to carry bur@@ dens to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system of autonomous , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , one of our laboratories . &quot;
there is no external cameras .
each air@@ machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external orders are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a flight device , that tries to beat two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ ators , it is efficient in advance @-@ moving efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ lets , it can float , and therefore has a great benefit at the start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a downside . &quot;
a limitation of m@@ illing @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind@@ bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance through practice can be improved .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts that work together to inj@@ ure you .
&quot; several decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly TV @-@ controlled flight devices , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; long ago , we discovered that flies with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote machine . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ ap , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ruin , no further actu@@ ator or controversi@@ es , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , there happens very much in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the likelihood to throw it exactly when to see me all , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the Mon@@ bu@@ inner is an exercise in recovery time , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ants , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only sy@@ mmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; thus , he receives the proper skill ; &quot;
&quot; moving in space to all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight leaders . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest is learned directly at flying . &quot;
see you this .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers machines .
this is in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
if you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by doing a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration was investigated synthetic shock .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard Micro Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one dart bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alisation and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room she is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine is there to practice on Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us the reward is in the development and the creation .
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , is the icing on the cake . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago surrounded by a very distant galaxy two black holes each other ever faster , they turned so the mass of thre@@ es in a ten@@ ths in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , they lit brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the whole of us known universe . &quot;
it was a very big boy .
&quot; but their energy put them free , but not in the form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was drawn into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; in order , we arrange the events first . &quot;
1,3 billion years ago has just been the most holy life on the earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ ces , humans and -- God stand for us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly mut@@ ed -- R@@ ai Weiss of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to seek a huge Laser@@ det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves that arise by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them held them crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , design and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer and gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ law observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LIG@@ O could be significantly increased , which increased the performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O has launched a last test run by some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting from my deadly sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all this , for which I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical Physi@@ cians on MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their by observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ us@@ ation in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when temporary , the wave turns into the room and its whole content is stretched into one direction and stretched into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ating lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses on the rel@@ ativity theory , often a really bad dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; for example , for example , each one of us was stretched and gest@@ ed by us during the advent of the waves . the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , you said the LIG@@ O employees for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers of laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length should be measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear power . that is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physic@@ ists are Finnish and with the support of the public , certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to LIG@@ O . Scott claims to LIG@@ O is more of a ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite handy . for example , you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points . &quot;
with sounds it is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much : &quot;
face the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain characteristics such as clay and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now he is talking just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob cras@@ hes them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ ous Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make easy pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by considering changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for LIG@@ O are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we transform wave pattern in all , we can hear the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity to listen , can tell us about much about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been employed for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , not rotating holes , cir@@ pen simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turning the two bodies very quickly and you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . this sounds like : Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu !
&quot; it is a kind of movement , engra@@ ined in the wave form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard the LIG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ al sound &#93; somebody , who knows what he must hear , recognizes this as sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ f@@ acher solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let us think of what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 teeth , the other with a mass of 36 others , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the ab@@ iding meaning of LIG@@ O .
&quot; LIG@@ O has paved a completely new way to study the universe , as it was never possible before . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not seen .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ h stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical operations occur however at the core , hidden behind thousand kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see there as these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the ur@@ ch@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; with the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible , to look back to the beginning . &quot;
and the most important : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening .
&quot; in fact , LIG@@ O found equal in the first attempt of things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : Me : the kind of stars , the black holes come forth , like LIG@@ O them , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the sau@@ er@@ ers for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O gives us a completely different view of the events of the universe , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we left out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now consists of being as brave as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; that I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; it happened , and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , I feared my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep speeches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg . &quot;
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , on an un@@ expec@@ tedly . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons all &quot;
as if it were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once , if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
that yes was the beginning
&quot; a new living setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to always play with them whenever you go about it . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I understood the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out of we@@ ave you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ire TV . I produce TV .
&quot; I make TV , in grand style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for spreading 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV broad@@ cast@@ el can lie between three and six million dollars .
say we say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days at four shows , thus all nine days 20 million dollars television , four broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production , 4 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my television series will run each other on Thursday evening .
all over the world are running my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not just produced , so still ob@@ endless . I have to take time , really sti@@ cking creative time to gather my fans for camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who that still makes ?
&quot; no one , that is why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just on the computer ro@@ b and imagin@@ able , and it is true if I say , I understand it &apos;s not about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set troops up , when painted I on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so as if you have a high note , lying a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me if the work is running well .
&quot; a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the buzz sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume that I declare to them the sums of writing , that I do not speak writing , that the writing is filled with me . &quot;
&quot; do not understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the buzz -- when I started with television production , when I began working and working , build and work together , I discovered this thing , this buzz , this energy . &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a buzz , then you can not strive to be different from size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not to be different than asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the buzz .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only , that I did not make for the failure , and I know only that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more ship@@ ments , the more transi@@ tions , the more work there are , the more things are simultaneously , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land I have frightened , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this buzz . I love the sums .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I just this buzz ?
and then stopped the buzz .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ crowded , exaggerated . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there but you can write my N@@ anny .
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are a baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the buzz stopped . &quot;
the sums of the engine ri@@ pped .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , through worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ ing , a tit@@ anium not , there is not up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; ha@@ y you out , bl@@ ö@@ der author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do it , you are doing , you are doing a teacher to be a mother , a painter who knows the sums , and knows how the sums you know , when the sums stopped , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I imagine my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way out to go late , and she says : &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I already want to say no more than I will be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when is that happening ?
&quot; I don &apos;t miss it when I am Titan , and my sums are sad , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is excellent because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the Sum@@ mary , I can do nothing , except to ascend . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quietly .
&quot; the land I have frightened , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xing sti@@ cking and the song in which it &apos;s getting rid of , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Eis@@ sac &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me solve itself .
a mental door goes up and a energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a buzz . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the buzz , the working environment , the tit@@ anium environment , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe me using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how it is capable of my brain , then I forgot what the real sums . &quot;
the sums have no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real buzz depends on the love .
&quot; the buzz is the current , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums have ignored the pressure of history , the waiting tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ per God the false words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice , unless I want to hear the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; to play , do not play ans@@ at@@ bil@@ ise like working . &quot;
&quot; the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I am always working , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at work as at home .
&quot; this entry is painful , because what kind of person would prefer to be as a home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , is none of it . &quot;
&quot; we walk around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we crum@@ bs Sei@@ fen@@ bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always feel according to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped working with the game ?
you can also tell it ! tell you always yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for naive , for a day@@ dreaming . &quot;
you probably have right but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , up to them that they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a pupp@@ et is replacing me or Ke@@ ks .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ y @-@ daughter all 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not require . &quot;
&quot; each can bring 15 minutes to the piece , even at a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes a bit !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish . &quot;
but 15 minutes are there !
&quot; my children are my kindness , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with their own children . it is about pleasure , &quot;
around the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and save it yourself .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I would love and I was able to meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
want to play ? &quot; stands shortly for everything I had given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the apprenticeship as I wanted to make myself more and more .
15 minutes in the piece : why not give you full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months it opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear a UFO melody , she meets me and my soul . she guides me into new ideas . I util@@ ise it to the ful@@ lest and love my job . &quot;
I like the buzz but I do not love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sums that sums it ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my buzz .
the sums of life .
the buzz of Love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is schn@@ u@@ b that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in hand . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the more happier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I am working . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the country I &apos;m frightened to the marathon I run , the tro@@ d , the buzz , the sums , the sums , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel that sums , the more this unusual , be@@ aming , naked and new feeling of living in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things out , I get up to life . &quot;
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans do not have a chance .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke , or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was surgical Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tried to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
&quot; sure they have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep @-@ enh@@ n@@ stimulation &quot; . thereby , one im@@ pl@@ uses a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that neurological function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson which suffered under fierce tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
&quot; Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior wa@@ iter @-@ doctor and worked every day and night in the emergency .
often I was eager to treat patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain flo@@ ats and the skull @-@ touch increases .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull @-@ ends . &quot;
sometimes one has to remove part of a wol@@ f@@ ading brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the shaken brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to leave cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; the cells of a tissue play will grow , comparable to very small children that can be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to flour@@ ish . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it got Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you are still aware of the bi@@ ologi@@ an education that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the body .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are im@@ mortal . &quot;
but these cells were talking differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our great @-@ stags cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they are involved in healing the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we are standing in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then to cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François did
and they then tick colour in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step we cut it off at the same level of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ l@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we cut these cells into normal brain tissues cut off ? and what will happen when we cut the same cells in damaged brain fabric ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkey . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we pl@@ ung@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched that they disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken back home , they go back home . the space is already occupied , so they will not disappear , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we found an injury to and cher@@ ished exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been cut .
&quot; the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells we have colored in vit@@ ro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we set monkeys with a manual skills . &quot;
they had to take for@@ pel@@ lets of a tra@@ y .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they had achieved a stable skill level , we injured the wr@@ apping area in the mot@@ ic Cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree exactly as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . they recover in a certain degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side they see the monkey , which spontaneously recovered . &quot;
he can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now let &apos;s see when we pl@@ ain@@ ted the cells , the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were also for us very exciting outcomes .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Par@@ kinson . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ it@@ ate them in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who might need that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you begin clinical studies on the human being . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future as many years it will last until someone can get into hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it has a long time to select patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
&quot; first , one really must prove that it is useful before someone can offer this treatment to everyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit with TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
&quot; we tend to consider them as un@@ changing poetry . &quot;
we believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have doub@@ tless proven that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impres@@ sing growth , while policy remains completely non @-@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance ministers in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not affect the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my officers , told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished when it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe in it with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are painted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which today threatens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit paradox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize its Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash which , however , belongs to being anxious to invest it there , where it would be productive and income , with which to wear the debt mountain and also all of the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months in the US , in England and in the euro area , 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons of US dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , casting , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars sounds a lot of money until one compares it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time have been around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which are not the same due to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in an end @-@ loop the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors resulting from fear , the prophecy of the ov@@ ulation could be true , that his son will kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ wanted the circumstances to bring about the circumstances that lead him k@@ ills .
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely dev@@ onian art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and to particularly finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue , what do we understand among democracy ? &quot;
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the form of society , in which the free and the poor and the poor control the government . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they were the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of speech , but more important and decisive that they are entitled to them into political participation with equal vo@@ icing in questions of the state of state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy had concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete division of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been limited to politics , while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democracies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , and the economy gradually hi@@ ked politics and deprived them . &quot;
wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to the degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because that one can be in the government today , and not in power , because the power of politics is emig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ed so lasting the animals of which they are nourished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving in the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy , which has become so far @-@ balanced with the economy that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations growing , political estates is increasing , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; distri@@ butes of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; reserves the control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea about 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t work very well .
&quot; the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only recover by a miracle like in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it by being replaced with low tide of automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the tw@@ ins summit will be higher , the extravag@@ ance and the social conflicts deeper , just as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we are able to re@@ united the unified area , otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive . &quot;
&quot; the interest@@ ingly question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar in &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve the human being and people put their energy into resear@@ ching the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it look like , how could it look like these &quot; &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; utop@@ ia instead of &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar di@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all brief , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : ask a capital market in which you earn money while you work and where your capital is next to you , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all incomes come from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who do not belong there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting tw@@ ins summit . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : please briefly suggest that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the whole world trade in this currency is being tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the sales of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investments are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically suggested that John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe to you is a liber@@ alisation at the same time , in which it is privileged people preferred , and Marxist , because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ boards , global key@@ boards . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we aw@@ aken to such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratically . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the reunion of politics and the economy is ... do we do this , the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mer was referred to as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in democratic democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; also like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely in@@ hospitable . &quot;
BG : actually and now we are at ease .
&quot; Y@@ V : if one is not in@@ hospitable , one does not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you said clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the impression of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of the economy is , -- the area of the economy - a completely democratic area . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I must say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; -- -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China , resembles very much the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now , China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experience as the Greek finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I was saying that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to adopt us from self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous denial of denial was ag@@ grav@@ ated by the Eurozone and continues to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was that the denial revealed . &quot;
&quot; it is right to do it . unfortunately , the forces within the eurozone , within the European group , continues to deny the denial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what is coming . &quot;
this is the experience from the Soviet Union .
&quot; if one tries to maintain a business system that is not viable , cannot delay through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , but if the changes occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or something that exists in office after 6 months , especially in such a tense situation , he made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the pages of the don@@ or , to find a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the los@@ som@@ ing , which exp@@ elled through the euro zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika of the creditors , who imposed on these policies , and one : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of conversations , you seem to be still fairly pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the acqu@@ itted tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we allow ourselves to hit the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be just as retro@@ fit for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of Roy has never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 @-@ average minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for much of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is leit@@ motif at Amazon Studios
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ pin and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for making the shows and the content of publishing the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are at the right side of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ one , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ted to where you looked a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you what at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I believe you already need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean explo@@ iting , the average television -- shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , therefore Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk Roy Price . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he does not need guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and elect eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can see everyone free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon has come out for nothing , it is attacking , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are looking at these episodes .
&quot; however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team to take up everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you over@@ jumps and look again . &quot;
collect millions of data to determine with these data then what show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they gather the data , process these and resulting in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Re@@ public@@ s . &quot;
you made this show .
do anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yeah , &quot; alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that many of them can remember this show , because they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House landed at 7,5 - thus slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for the design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to find out these small details about the viewer : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had put together all the parts , they went a wagon and decided to do not make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series on a sen@@ ator . &quot;
know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards will get a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; it has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision that one meets , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you can optimize it through very powerful computer .
&quot; the Min@@ des@@ te , what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working so , then this is somewhat scary because we are living in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
know someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , this is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data . &quot;
also the data exp@@ ired companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can be predicted by data analytics out@@ breaks from flu , the terrible way -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big message sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year round year until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publishing in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data exp@@ ired companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows in decisions of life - at the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather make sure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ thin@@ kable many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; if you dis@@ miss this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the parts you need ; as a wide set the items put together again to summar@@ ise a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to break a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to sit down the parts again and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it , our brain . &quot;
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , there is parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to be able to write a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would not have been able to do . but the decision , how to put all these parts , then put together a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a big personal risk with that decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they we@@ ather@@ ed TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a secure decision , because they always could say : &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things will go wrong when data will start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool and not to forget it , this device is fairly useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before it gave data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no , you have to shake only the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly probable &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will start it later with a pilot demo .
&quot; I met some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ spect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you of course know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more pronounced like data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I think this is very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays , decisions to meet , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks of which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
