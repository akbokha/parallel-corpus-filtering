<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize for the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular, that the NSA was illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, in which the CIA had literally dragged drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter was not coincided?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost 10 years the government has been determined against corruption and urged him to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became the symbol of the pattern of government, whistle-blowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mute that they do.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked out with Risen, he did something that many brave reporters already did before him, he refused, and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"so from 2007 to 2015, Risen living in prison by the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, just days before the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had years of details that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government in Risen were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the period of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide themselves less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of having to fail and bring Risen to the statements, that also could do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators will be concerned without his consent, his phone references."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its loans, and even travel letters, with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to denounce Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and risked source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect against his attack, whistle-blowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much stuffed up from her work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blogging to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more and more possibilities to spade all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just like the technology of the government is allowed to use the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in fact, they are able to contact the moment in which they are in contact, rather than in the afterward."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that has not yet been written as a book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source system for whistle-blowers, which was originally developed by the Internet of famous Aaron Swartz, which has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation when I'm working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there, you can upload or send documents to you, just like any regular contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, that only the particular news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that threaten us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to make sure that not only technology, such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to give distraction. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the lack of abuse about the supply of soldiers knows and reported from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm goes to the contaminated water of Flint. or a pilgrim insider warned that we warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data leak of history was published [the" Panama Papers, "[what does that mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer of Global Witness about one explanation.] this week we have been found by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the Bar Mosbag Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosel Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's stamp in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people and others who are nervous on the next release, and on the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a agency's Plot or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying out of you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by a few minutes to hide and conceal their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people appearing this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a matrjoker.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports of this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far, in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle after which this tax havens work, MosBag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data center of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to have connections in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states you need less information to give less information to create a company than to get a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this kind of intransparence in the United States allows employees of boroughs to avert school children."</seg>
<seg id="69">It has scammers allowed to cut off especially susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself the African minister to buy the suspected money in the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked ourselves, that all of them made on an attorney to our investigators how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all happenings. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has made suggestions of our interwoven investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top-political, involved in scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to overcome this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very comforting as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing has ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite well that things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen more transparency towards greater transparency in the past few years, as regards the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people, who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headcompanies."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which get up and say," Intransparence is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians to recognise the problem and use them, by laws this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally end the lack of transparency, which now allow this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I had almost abducted and had landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backbow."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in red Mazda remained and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and made a road trip through all the land. after that, he would go on to the peace of peace."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It became late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where are you asleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know it yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says, he would go to peaceborps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to get kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazar."</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard myself saying," I have an air conditioner. you can sleep in my living room. "</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," Come, how to please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I started at the ceiling and thought:" "Oh man! what did I make a broken?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I was such a fear that I got out of bed, on toe-pointed to the door, and my sleep-room door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he bought from me is hanging in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accomodate people on my air mattress, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"do we make a time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleted, my roommates, and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can make it possible to turn fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I persuaded how we could earn something about it. our apartment is going to be a designer bed and a desk including, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We asked a website and so-called "air-rats and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happiest guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we also found."</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese marham Omelts totally different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all the city. as we farewell our last guest and fell the door to the castle, Brian and I went to the castle."</seg>
<seg id="134">We have just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors:" we want to create a website based on people public pictures of their private spaces, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind rooms, whose doors are closed when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can then invite wildly people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in comfort, would invest in a shop, the stranger is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"when you have a problem, one thinks on the things that one can be well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create trust by design immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a precious tasting, which degree can we care."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unspersed cell phone to your left seat of seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">Panic that you feel right now -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing, which is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the horrifying cell phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So do most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just once, who now has Al Gores cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim on Twitter that he dictates to the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cellphones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have imagined with his name, if he would have told where he is coming, like his dog or children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 Beurals who all say: "he can really hold very well cled phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you need to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-trained feedback system strengthens the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to throw up negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their findings before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have done with Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are at age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most like most.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting happens when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three ratings, nothing changes. "</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, it changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stickers commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we found that trust is dependent on how much you get there."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reaction to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you have too little told how for example" "hi!", "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"tell you a lot, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- - the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "king artworks in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create design with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give advice on which subjects you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we had not reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than ready to lay down these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people will take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate parties or homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Host have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing more limmerit than these calls. it already hurts when I think only about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, there had only a fraction of the 123 million made nights only a fraction per problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people entrusted each other to law.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, it can be Wonderful."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">It even ended blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, which tend to be heart-coloured due to sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guards who save life, even though they do not know each other."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without paying the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay will run.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just to mention" the lease ", the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">"share Economy describes a trade, the human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">"people put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when one travels nowadays, this is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would be, however, if travelling a rich buffet of local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visit, a group there would wait to wait a group there to show a thoroughly rinse and to show a pub in a pub that one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from ground up to co-sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take up the thought of a joint share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow ourselves to society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"were now offered by residents. students who were looking for a place,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were taken out. there were Incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, there will be €785 000 people in 191 countries with a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we see that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the startling</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a Expertess?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain-laundering, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay on the check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media shows people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Moslems, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchteer-Fitness fanatics</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslimin."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, for, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I chose to bear the hijab, my head."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you think you yourself?</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lily was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, and with the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought after, exhibited in question, doubted and thought ultimately."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication based on every reading of the grain.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in this. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever had the feeling that someone you truly perceives you fully understand, and yet somehow love?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I later had, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream "." "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had at the end, looked at the screen and looked the word" Eilmessage. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spun out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved to the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked my country, but in the Nu, the works of others converted me from another of citizenship into a suspicious one."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove in silence -- as deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," Be watchful, "" Seid careful, "" blew in well lighted areas, "" Versammmeth not you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then there was Friday in that week -- the day, where Muslims gather for prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go to this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held for Muslims, went outside and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people who were attacked this country, attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have fuelled the anger of people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say people:" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to connect Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor as a whole and a benign tumor is only available under review.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first aid and Olympias."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques in America make more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it may keep a few parking available, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit to a mosque leads to consider people of other faith tolerant, and to show greater citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the Washington D.C., DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, you have noticed that he starts online. as a first, the person from her community is cut off, even from her family, so that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhears their behavior and ideology is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to avoid radicalization, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"after all, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as man, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku fracture with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you cast a look at it, it is not driving what they are in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brutality that they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she had imagined to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke she brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given its anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and its community again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept it to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show when we fear, pass at least three things. "</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian governance system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if one reports out testing messages, which is negative about Muslims, they agreed to rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look, when the mood against Muslims shook up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to mosquito-terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has sensible and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early Warnsign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear owes us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collectivation, it is not just about having to explain themselves."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>

<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous person, whom she knew."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we loved it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove in silence, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, my shoes went out, went to prayer shalle, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam did an announcement, thank you and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who have come to attack us, but to stand with us."</seg>

<seg id="407">"as a platform for hobbyists, it is about to become a billion business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for professional drones. it is made possible in research institutions around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air parcel entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Frac Centre in France live in front of audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">Through interconnecting passengers high speed and acceleration in the narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-constantly burdened structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens to deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system of autonomous, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, one of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There is no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each airmachine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external orders are available at the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called Heckstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, that tries to beat two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrators, it is efficient in advance-moving efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starlets, it can float, and therefore has a great benefit at the start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of milling-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as windbows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air device doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance through practice can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, such a question would be: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts that work together to injure you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"several decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly TV-controlled flight devices, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailoring."</seg>
<seg id="435">"long ago, we discovered that flies with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote machine. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clap, hinges and cross-ruin, no further actuator or controversies, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, there happens very much in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it exactly when to see me all, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the Monbuinner is an exercise in recovery time, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellants, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the proper skill;"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space to all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even as it rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight leaders."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest is learned directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">See you this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propellers machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If you build them together they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by doing a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was investigated synthetic shock.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one dart bread -- and equip them with localisation and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room she is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine is there to practice on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the reward is in the development and the creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">"the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, is the icing on the cake."</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">"but their energy put them free, but not in the form of light --"</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was drawn into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"in order, we arrange the events first."</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago has just been the most holy life on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, sauces, humans and -- God stand for us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly muted -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to seek a huge Laserdetector to search for gravitational-waves that arise by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized them as crazy geniuses, so the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed its idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, design and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometer and gravitational-law observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could be significantly increased, which increased the performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"beginning of September 2015, LIGO has launched a last test run by some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collious black holes through the earth."</seg>

<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting from my deadly sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all this, for which I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical Physicians on MIT. he studied gravitational-waves from black holes and their by observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crousation in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when temporary, the wave turns into the room and its whole content is stretched into one direction and stretched into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrating lecturers in courses on the relativity theory, often a really bad dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"for example, for example, each one of us was stretched and gested by us during the advent of the waves. the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 Nulls after the comma, followed by a 1st Darum, you said the LIGO employees for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers of laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length should be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear power. that is grotesque."</seg>

<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are Finnish and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims to LIGO is more of a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your cell phone. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite handy. for example, you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">Face the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain characteristics such as clay and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now he is talking just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob crashes them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"duous Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make easy pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by considering changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO are the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we transform wave pattern in all, we can hear the universe literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity to listen, can tell us about much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been employed for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, cirpen simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly and you hear the same circus with an additional key change. this sounds like: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, engrained in the wave form."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard the LIGO: [Surrenal sound] somebody, who knows what he must hear, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with the 30-facher solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think of what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 teeth, the other with a mass of 36 others, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO has paved a completely new way to study the universe, as it was never possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not seen.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why mash stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical operations occur however at the core, hidden behind thousand kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see there as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the urchang is covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the gravitational-waves it should be possible, to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found equal in the first attempt of things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: Me: the kind of stars, the black holes come forth, like LIGO them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sauerers for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO gives us a completely different view of the events of the universe, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we left out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"it happened, and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, I feared my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, to keep speeches, my social fear -- Puff, weg."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, on an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplainable reasons all"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if it were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once, if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said," Yes. "</seg>
<seg id="573">That yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new living setting in my family. from there I swear to always play with them whenever you go about it. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a startling side effect: only recently I understood the" "Yes" "to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out of weave you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make TV, in grand style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV-season, I am responsible for spreading 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV broadcastel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Say we say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days at four shows, thus all nine days 20 million dollars television, four broadcasts that are simultaneously in production, 4 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world are running my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not just produced, so still obendless. I have to take time, really sticking creative time to gather my fans for campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that is why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I'm talking about work, so you understand that I'm not just on the computer rob and imaginable, and it is true if I say, I understand it's not about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deep into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set troops up, when painted I on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so as if you have a high note, lying a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume that I declare to them the sums of writing, that I do not speak writing, that the writing is filled with me."</seg>
<seg id="616">"do not understand me wrong, that does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I started with television production, when I began working and working, build and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you can not strive to be different from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not to be different than aspire to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only, that I did not make for the failure, and I know only that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more shipments, the more transitions, the more work there are, the more things are simultaneously, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I have frightened, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stopped the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overcrowded, exaggerated."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there but you can write my Nanny.</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "estimation, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzz stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine ripped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, through worked weekends, no remoring, a titanium not, there is not up, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I had no more fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "hay you out, blöder author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you do it, you are doing, you are doing a teacher to be a mother, a painter who knows the sums, and knows how the sums you know, when the sums stopped, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I imagine my "southern states waitress" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out to go late, and she says:" Mom, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no more than I will be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I don't miss it when I am Titan, and my sums are sad, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mom, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is excellent because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the Summary, I can do nothing, except to ascend."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I have frightened, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, waxing sticking and the song in which it's getting rid of, or whatever the girl in" "The Eissac". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solve itself.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and a energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working environment, the titanium environment, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe me using broadcasts and TV hours and how it is capable of my brain, then I forgot what the real sums."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums have no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the buzz is the current, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums have ignored the pressure of history, the waiting tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whisper God the false words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice, unless I want to hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"to play, do not play ansatbilise like working."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth does hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I am always working, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entry is painful, because what kind of person would prefer to be as a home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, is none of it."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we walk around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crumbs Seifenbubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always feel according to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we stopped working with the game?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also tell it! tell you always yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naive, for a daydreaming."</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, up to them that they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a puppet is replacing me or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teeny-daughter all 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs it not require."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring 15 minutes to the piece, even at a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a bit!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are there!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my kindness, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with their own children. it is about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and save it yourself.</seg>

<seg id="765">15 minutes in the piece: why not give you full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months it opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear a UFO melody, she meets me and my soul. she guides me into new ideas. I utilise it to the fullest and love my job."</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums that sums it... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends. "</seg>

<seg id="778">"it is schnub that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in hand. my brain is still functional. my bonfires still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>

<seg id="788">"I am author. I think things out, I get up to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans do not have a chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke, or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was surgical Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tried to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"sure they have heard of one of the best known, the" deep-enhnstimulation ". thereby, one impluses a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons so that neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered under fierce trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior waiter-doctor and worked every day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I was eager to treat patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at Schädel-Hirn-Traumata the brain floats and the skull-touch increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the skull-ends."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes one has to remove part of a wolfading brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the shaken brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to leave cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"the cells of a tissue play will grow, comparable to very small children that can be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it got Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biologian education that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the body.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were talking differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our great-stags cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are involved in healing the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are standing in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then to cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then tick colour in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we cut it off at the same level of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotlant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we cut these cells into normal brain tissues cut off? and what will happen when we cut the same cells in damaged brain fabric?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkey."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we plunged the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that they disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken back home, they go back home. the space is already occupied, so they will not disappear, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we found an injury to and cherished exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been cut.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells we have colored in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we set monkeys with a manual skills."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take forpellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had achieved a stable skill level, we injured the wrapping area in the motic Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree exactly as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of sculptural brain mechanisms. they recover in a certain degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left hand side they see the monkey, which spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">He can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now let's see when we plainted the cells, the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also for us very exciting outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who might need that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you begin clinical studies on the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc. "</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future as many years it will last until someone can get into hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it has a long time to select patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, one really must prove that it is useful before someone can offer this treatment to everyone."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">"we tend to consider them as unchanging poetry."</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have doubtless proven that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressing growth, while policy remains completely non-democratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is waning with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as finance ministers in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not affect the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my officers, told me that democracy would be abolished when it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in it with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are painted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which today threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash which, however, belongs to being anxious to invest it there, where it would be productive and income, with which to wear the debt mountain and also all of the things that humanity urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months in the US, in England and in the euro area, 3.4 Billions of US dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, casting, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billions US dollars sounds a lot of money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time have been around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which are not the same due to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 year olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in an end-loop the pessimism of investors resulting from fear, the prophecy of the ovulation could be true, that his son will kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted the circumstances to bring about the circumstances that lead him kills.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely devonian art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and to particularly finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue, what do we understand among democracy? "</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society, in which the free and the poor and the poor control the government."</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenic democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the Athenic democracy was and is that they were the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of speech, but more important and decisive that they are entitled to them into political participation with equal voicing in questions of the state of state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy had concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for mistress."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete division of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been limited to politics, while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, and the economy gradually hiked politics and deprived them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to the degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because that one can be in the government today, and not in power, because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about like a flock of carnivores that sustained so lasting the animals of which they are nourished, decimated that they are starving in the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy, which has become so far-balanced with the economy that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations growing, political estates is increasing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism the" Demos "[the people] distributes of democracy, the higher the twins summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back and it would be better if the" Demos "reserves the control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea about 100 years ago and it didn't work very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only recover by a miracle like in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by being replaced with low tide of automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twins summit will be higher, the extravagance and the social conflicts deeper, just as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reorganize the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we are able to reunited the unified area, otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance hyperautocracy that makes the film" "Matrix" "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interestingly question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar in" "matrix", "in which machines serve the human being and people put their energy into researching the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it look like, how could it look like these" "star Trek" "utopia instead of" "matrix" "similar diystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, in all brief, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: ask a capital market in which you earn money while you work and where your capital is next to you, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes come from capital and redeeming and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it, and employees who do not belong there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twins summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy: please briefly suggest that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the whole world trade in this currency is being traded -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the sales of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investments are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically suggested that John Maynard Keynes had suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe to you is a liberalisation at the same time, in which it is privileged people preferred, and Marxist, because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keyboards, global keyboards."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken to such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunion of politics and the economy is... do we do this, the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand that Larry Summer was referred to as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in democratic democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"also like Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am also completely inhospitable."</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually and now we are at ease.</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if one is not inhospitable, one does not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers, you said clearly what you think of the West's view on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the impression of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of the economy is, -- the area of the economy - a completely democratic area."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I must say this provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"-- -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, like John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China, resembles very much the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now, China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the Greek finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I was saying that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to adopt us from self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial of denial was aggravated by the Eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was that the denial revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is right to do it. unfortunately, the forces within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what is coming."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to maintain a business system that is not viable, cannot delay through political will and authoritarianism in life, but if the changes occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you looking ahead?</seg>

<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or something that exists in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an honest interest in the pages of the donor, to find a common solution."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of Roy has never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22-average minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for much of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leitmotif at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hairpin and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for making the shows and the content of publishing the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are at the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Throne, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that addicted to where you looked a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you what at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I believe you already need special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the mean exploiting, the average television -- shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, therefore Roy Price doesn't want to risk Roy Price."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he does not need guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and elect eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can see everyone free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon has come out for nothing, it is attacking, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are looking at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they don't know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team to take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you overjumps and look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">Collect millions of data to determine with these data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they gather the data, process these and resulting in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republics. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yeah," alpha House "," but it seems that many of them can remember this show, because they were not so good. "</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landed at 7,5 - thus slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for the design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to find out these small details about the viewer: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had put together all the parts, they went a wagon and decided to do not make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series on a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards "." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons. "</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards will get a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very competitive, data sealed."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data for a decision that one meets, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can optimize it through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the Mindeste, what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working so, then this is somewhat scary because we are living in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Know someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data expired companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can be predicted by data analytics outbreaks from flu, the terrible way -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big message sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year round year until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publishing in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data expired companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows in decisions of life - at the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather make sure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people unthinkable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"if you dismiss this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the parts you need; as a wide set the items put together again to summarise a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to sit down the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it, our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, there is parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to be able to write a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would not have been able to do. but the decision, how to put all these parts, then put together a show like" House of Cards "which was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a big personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they weathered TV ideas, then as they chose" alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a secure decision, because they always could say:" "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things will go wrong when data will start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool and not to forget it, this device is fairly useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before it gave data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no, you have to shake only the ball to get an answer." highly probable "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will start it later with a pilot demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I met some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more pronounced like data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I think this is very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays, decisions to meet, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks of which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
