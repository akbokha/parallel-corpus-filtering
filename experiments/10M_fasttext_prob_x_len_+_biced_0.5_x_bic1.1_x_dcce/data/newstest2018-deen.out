Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt is to meet young people today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ elle where is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn Tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ser manage the ru@@ sty ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch encourages exciting stories to day .
it &apos;s nervous when land@@ cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; this knows everyone who had to be exciting at this time , because the car Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow instead of a crossing road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but it is very conclu@@ sive . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; then it becomes clear , as cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ werk , which one does not recognise as such . &quot;
&quot; the big coverage map were shown for cities and villages for detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets . &quot;
these arose according to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Ver@@ sur@@ ing administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ski@@ pping the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your clients : Napoleon .
the French military leaders occupied Bavaria since the Spring of 1800 during the Second World War Cri@@ mean war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic record in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops went out with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February 18@@ 01 : they were the contemporary neighbors , which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ ve@@ ying government . &quot;
the pri@@ posi@@ tional leaf for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the other to find on the website of the Bav@@ arian National Library .
the comparison morning / Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; Send@@ ling was incorporated 21 years after the map of the map , so 1877 , as a Munich district . &quot;
today sub@@ ver@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses shelter around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named only 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the western park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the Hin@@ denburg , a small@@ ish map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written number@@ ing out of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; small par@@ c@@ els today occupy no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; country in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green space is characterised by the north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese since 18@@ 10 on the October of the October Revolution , was in the 19th century in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the gene@@ alogy page one reads in the area of today &apos;s district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street name &quot; &quot; on Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or by the &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fiel@@ straße we once saved people with madness . &quot;
there in 18@@ 58 / 59 was the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to King Ludwig &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the strings of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; he is also forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has employed himself for an exhibition with the prison . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been first place , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity does not have enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ cle in hair of 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East since 2006 , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people are now meeting in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth @-@ home with training .
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in architec@@ turally view on the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , was destroyed during the Second World War in bombar@@ d@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the purchase street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 are many holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where this day was the pre @-@ working day , and on 5 April 2017 , the groundbreaking ceremony took place for the second S @-@ Bahn platform . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared to the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the national union to promote color has issued a warning for colored people based on discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks by the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should come into force up to 28 August 2017 , while travelling through the state demands special attention and be expressed with extreme caution , since a number of frag@@ mented , en@@ force@@ ful incidents in recent times occur in the entire state and here is noted , &quot; says it in the opinion of the Group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to attract Dis@@ crimin@@ ality , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that dis@@ proportionate to minorities , the group , the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have wounds of civil rights , men pass . &quot;
&quot; they are kept together because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency , which we have not yet heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the quoted incidents like rac@@ ist Ver@@ go against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no gasoline by the state and taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in custody without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report of the office of the General Pro@@ secutor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state will be more common in the state 75 per cent more frequently than White . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring interest money or to know the relatives that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate speech in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ breaking report of the F@@ BI , which lays the state regarding the number of such violations in the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law , which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Society ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration law enforcement , which will contribute to local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to further margins . &quot;
&quot; travel openings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
past@@ ure project is elementary
the F@@ ai@@ bach Wei@@ de@@ fence @-@ Project is a success project and continues in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Group by Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have gained a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the Sanc@@ tuary of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the fishing bacher CD@@ U @-@ town met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann continued to gain insights into its operation , in which he generates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows kis@@ ses and as well as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the ageing market@@ able path for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este exclusively region@@ ally .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ H@@ V chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the Wei@@ dec@@ eler@@ ate project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I can not be profitable on such steep areas .
&quot; the green space for a lot of work , much has to be dealt with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the eleventh operation , and managed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ isers , even if he has no bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune recognised the importance of the un@@ dec@@ eit project , and is happy with the leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
we hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the land could be pulled out quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; stressed the Mayor . &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure space is about 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter carried the church fishing . &quot;
&quot; thus , they love the farmer 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ de@@ fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; stated Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac continued : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land women . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss stood firm : &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ ure @-@ Care ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the government promotion of past@@ ure care .
the goal is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ alds .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ signed conveyor belts .
&quot; in addition , the un@@ covering area must not be in@@ conceivable ( H@@ ang@@ a@@ version over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dec@@ eler@@ ate project , the application of eight participants currently runs with 24 plots , which would like to have almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the lower cost is more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime transfer is it if they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic A@@ xt in a hit@@ ch dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of Presidents for the dras@@ tic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller attacked not the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty ators would have denied him if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid their importance , and in particular the importance that you have been attributed as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go here to a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom to enligh@@ ten the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formed himself it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary resonance to the emerging words of Lazarus , the only one where a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; your needy , your poor , / Your be@@ ards masses , who are longing for free to breathe free , to the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus and their friends , who set themselves to place their words after their death on the basis - did very well that they have accomplished a highly political action . &quot;
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a un@@ used classical representation .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminine cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly like Lazarus , the meaning of the statue changed , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of John Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not a call , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conservative that the American flame is moving into the world : &quot; lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
she is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh met here on something .
the significance of the statue is entirely and at all a matter of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative fact of Lazarus consisted in it to see them as they were seen by the exhaustive , but hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the true sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome , which they have to hear . &quot;
&quot; and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump have ever to recognize . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black Stor@@ ks Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two pi@@ ers belonged to the team of Great Britain .
&quot; the Director of the L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 member of the world will perform a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that will start on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; in Scotland &quot; &quot; something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to continue until we find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is ; it is absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected to the team member team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they were living or exercising , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth Silver Medal , who will compete in her fifth world Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 she@@ ers are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid@@ range of Mu@@ ir is on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5.000 m of the runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another shepherd , which one should be observed after a great season , which included the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembers their first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the Mann@@ it@@ ner &apos;s capitals says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special about to be team @-@ capitals that was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chosen to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all those who belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise on Po@@ dia . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there .
blocking Facebook : Be@@ ast yourself not to be a public office if you do not tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something from a bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers smote him because of all , from domestic policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sha@@ ved in the review , safely . &quot;
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we will be led like sheep to the slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work to be more like Washington .
ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and er@@ ased their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Society compl@@ ained him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the stat@@ ab of the governor left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a Republi@@ can Governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the two @-@ ranking approval of the 50 governors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with its voters and to debate his hair @-@ loose head after chemotherapy on its side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that will be officially designated as officially and by co @-@ workers who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the acts of the governor and argued that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moderation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people , who vibr@@ ate the wh@@ ip online . &quot;
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are just real people who speak with their chosen guides : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a parish , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
they all told that their comments are respectful and thoughtful and not prof@@ essors .
the pastor showed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled Ho@@ gan &apos;s faith .
&quot; Lac@@ sh@@ mi Lak@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ tive but she asked for hate @-@ hate . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and gave other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are used by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employee of the governor as &quot; concentrated &quot; spam attack , &quot; would others probably be &quot; inter@@ rog@@ ation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critics or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one could have done the same that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical cor@@ als , to burn or to burning demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but this is precisely what happened just digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S.@@ S. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a vot@@ er by their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky governor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at the moment , Washington had a similar impact on the Internet at affordable Por@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ ly between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous envelope to his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous Tro@@ ll .
&quot; the people who used pseudon@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and the shipping sector with the UK , expressed his office , according to historical documents submitted by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have them sil@@ enced .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are part of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days in local comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field left until the En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue , and acts as a tournament leader in the name of the club @-@ founder and the CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he laid this place .
he is a eager@@ ly fi@@ ery of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to having a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Challenge tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was in the year after I won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on the home page . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf game .
&quot; I am glad , as far as it has gone . &quot;
&quot; with the trio on the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sister in the field , the others are Andrew Classic , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ros@@ s Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive exposure
in the past two decades fewer people have died due to pas@@ sions of lung cancer .
this result is the scientists of the university hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lung cancer are due to passive exposure to passive exposure , he said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved up an own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
at that time there have been also 400 lung cancer cases because of pas@@ pas@@ sions per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections are proving to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in the time , &quot; &quot; says the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of home closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which hin@@ ders the construction again and again , represents a big problem for the construction up@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists from red lights and un@@ locks is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the street was locked and only the bus buses are entitled to travel .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p are employed for weeks with the works on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; fortunately we were greeted by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i does the dinner cooks they do not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ iment in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually lays a sweet potato - locally as &apos; not@@ a &apos; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the res@@ cin@@ ded tu@@ ber is taken with eager , troubled hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay side , she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of their man , they were not assigned to fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is here common .
&quot; of course , it can be too dangerous : the majority of the village are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one w@@ ned it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia than just 1,0@@ 26 elders by a public H@@ ander@@ ft@@ ment before the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that stir@@ red up for the independence of the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal observing . &quot;
in 2003 the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ brown , and out of shaft roofs , which were converted by r@@ ust into several yellow brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indones@@ ians have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans came to a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indonesia of the poorest province , where 28 % of the population lives under the poverty line and some of the worst im@@ mortal and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia have . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia of the Gold Land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gol@@ d@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ shop@@ per , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
in 2015 Free@@ port was built in the value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indones@@ ian milit@@ ants remain a suff@@ oc@@ ated presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ bian demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden gar@@ ans and are treated gn@@ it@@ less .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 papers have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military . &quot;
Mass@@ ent@@ ations in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal @-@ hoch@@ land in the 1970 @-@ er years were arrested in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission to commit genocide .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police in the past took over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we commerci@@ alize all means , in a report from the Arch@@ diocese Bris@@ bane taken from 2016 , in the reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical attacks are especially popular among another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since each week &apos;s incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia and researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the bol@@ ts have been reinforced because Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is of 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , since Muslim economic immigrants come from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ inen sell @-@ rats chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ice cream . &quot;
local people are fighting for taking part here .
&quot; the migrants started to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ hei@@ mix@@ er who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama M@@ om , the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - tasted its market . &quot;
&quot; Indones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , in the popular masses and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address inequalities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election struggle 2014 . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betrayed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai has suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October a deep point . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas at a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indones@@ ian soldiers jour@@ ne@@ yed on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frightened children told them they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers participated in her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who drank , had conquered , and hit the group with their defen@@ ders , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard beaten that he fell into the Com@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission set in fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch in front of the local police council and the military commander in order to demand justice . &quot;
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle permanently and im@@ im@@ itate a bird of bird - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones at police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ oping danger , and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his multic@@ ol@@ oured wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , lots of shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; I ran@@ ged to him and studied his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears a name as many Indones@@ ians , the TI@@ ME in gri@@ mmer mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the Che@@ er@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters , that his officers wanted their station to &quot; secure &quot; because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we have to defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many other wounded . &quot;
the messages about the kill@@ ings occurred only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Com@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and to tackle the historical abnorm@@ alities of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he entered an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical violations of human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most violations have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat than he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said he did not set any plans in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
&quot; instead , all is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; accused , charged by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been put together , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such allegations with gri@@ mm@@ ed unbelie@@ ving .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ic repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ wer@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood di@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the inhabitants and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others have been injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he conf@@ is@@ oned in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
Ascen@@ ded villagers prot@@ ested before the sit@@ ing office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the villagers were cast stones at officers , which reacted to it by fired war@@ ts . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and killed a killer .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness , as the injured here was quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house .
the Dei@@ y@@ ai @-@ Parliament has called to hold the participating officers to account and to withdraw the police bri@@ g@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ g@@ us@@ d for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of sensual development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal groups Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , claiming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by increasing the spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pretext of securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dies again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place &quot; . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the bit rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for local people . &quot;
bread is just as far as range .
&quot; the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot;
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , which can be able to process four or five fields of the potato potato . &quot;
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian r@@ up@@ ien ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants grew , since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger number . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary ability to perform their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ l and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given rare permission for filming . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indones@@ ian un@@ tranquil east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ phal@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights accidents . &quot;
local governments want to take note of more foreign governments .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , attended by the leadership of the human right @-@ messenger Ke@@ es Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 visited , erup@@ ted their silence and sup@@ pressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; in Indonesia , 2019 , has a further presidential election , but Pap@@ ua would say they will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in impover@@ ished education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , see her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ offering led a last symbolic act of the rut : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never come to justice , but at least let them not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with ges@@ ic head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residence towers of the world in Dubai , its bol@@ ts and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is swe@@ pt in just two years through the high @-@ house , which one calls in random the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alert and when writing the people .
&quot; we ran@@ ged the stairs downhill , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; told a residents who called his name as George , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 clock local time ( 00@@ .00 hours GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building disp@@ osed . &quot;
&quot; the government said , they work in the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be re @-@ rev@@ ital@@ ise questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ homes throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage was made from clothing , external clothing to decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a meeting in June , with about 80 people died . &quot;
neither Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen out with his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the A@@ GM .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single @-@ single was only supported to play two winning rates , Hau@@ ck is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although it is often very long , but even so much appreci@@ ative five @-@ set classics will remain in the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore just under suspicion . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the assessment .
&quot; at all , not only for the vote was before the proposal reached the finals on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only relatively smaller details : so , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host &apos;s right in the first round in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements in terms of training places , etc , and the players will have to have less official media time before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 million travellers brings un@@ finished items to the aircraft , finding a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among fli@@ pass@@ codes yiel@@ ded that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously injured items to the check@@ points of U.S. Transportation Security Administration are over @-@ apply , including at least 6 percent that the plane stood , while they accidentally bore a b@@ anded knife or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed , they have bel@@ ated bel@@ ated that they were in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous with bul@@ lets , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted in more than 1,000 people , which was conducted by a Jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers would rather dis@@ respect the rules . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ quired , the en@@ cor@@ es that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
the most common objects that were inten@@ tionally captured by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent gave up knowing items with blades by means of security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respondents said , and 3.@@ 7 per cent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had un@@ inten@@ tionally brought drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have questioned travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smug@@ gling would have been brought through the airport security and how many it had done so much . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people , the most likely smug@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly @-@ accidentally - due to the safety wear , those were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
the people are often unsure which fluids are allowed to take them or how much of it .
&quot; so , it is no surprise that the largest amount of fluids that are conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; a while thought the people , the T@@ SA could see books as smug@@ gling ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel
&quot; electric @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k is available with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot;
he has so far failed to make a part of the clients withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers of revenue increases and even a gigantic sales aim , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ y a different , less gl@@ oss number : those of the cancell@@ ations on the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months Mus@@ k was often applied to the new car over 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k a : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders have been withdrawn 6@@ 3,000 already . &quot;
critics had always pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations in front of the analy@@ st Mus@@ k at a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; that the cancellation of so far approximately twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 cars delivered .
&quot; in 2018 it is intended to assemble all models - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , a total of 1800 reservations are currently coming . &quot;
&quot; who now orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be expected early in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la it creates , its brand new , never in practice tested production lines without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilisation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to larger delays , then the dis@@ connection of the reservations for Tes@@ la could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent the satisfied customers to run away in Sch@@ aren . &quot;
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves away from the rules of the Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he was compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the boss of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ causing aviation . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented changes when his agency proved to be the needs of the state environmental authorities in response to response faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his prior position in a federal government court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for bot@@ her@@ es o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he will delay compliance with a year in order to study the Plan and avoid the plan to interfere with local decisions or to impe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of sec@@ uting environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed , blocking or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ed regulatory rolling agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal tribunal in Washington has decided that the EPA has exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ anol . &quot;
&quot; in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt decided that his military @-@ turn with o@@ zone standards simply proposed the willingness of EPA in cooperation with the countries through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards pre@@ amplifier . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often kept the deadlines for carrying out and then waited for the execution of activists and others , and in an agreement struck the appointment for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who rejected the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority that it gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless the statement of EPA approved that P@@ ru@@ itt becomes his &quot; &quot; authority to delay &quot; &quot; and any other legally available &quot; &quot; made &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a broader reform of the o@@ zone .

Tum@@ lings celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 year of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery @-@ area will be invited to tum@@ ours on Sunday , 16 July at 16.@@ 30 to a Seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is a popular town of St. Hil@@ arius , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth charity seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and Pat@@ rons .
&quot; Walter Martin@@ i empha@@ sizes : &quot; &quot; it is a unique village @-@ village Klein@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg . Count Hermann by Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to tum@@ ors with the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and to his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the certificate of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the ru@@ sty parish church , there was also a splendid courtyard to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ym was part of it and not the other way round . &quot;
so there was also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the town of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the famous settlement of the village . &quot;
old cards from time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ym was born from the early medieval Fe@@ kir@@ k law .
&quot; one Lord who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also ent@@ ail this church . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a pastor or propose a new parish . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ est at Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell then , for the first time in 16@@ 92 , had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were introduced and the steep@@ ed parts were stolen .
the roof was in@@ tight .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church lifts and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from listening .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the cher@@ cht@@ ur@@ m were allowed to stand .
in the new year @-@ eight 18@@ 34 a storm dra@@ gged a storm the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent an accident , the tower has been abandoned . &quot;
only today &apos;s still available turbul@@ ence remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em by the &quot; Schaff@@ ant Rent@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
&quot; as an organizer invite the friends and sponsors on Sunday , 16 July , the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the contributions of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matte@@ is .

the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 15 : 30 PM .
the seren@@ ade is held in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows toward the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers set out the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade is only held at dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and listening . &quot;
the friends and Pat@@ rons tum@@ ours feel particularly oblig@@ ated to the home care as the Seren@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Martin@@ i .
association wants to test approval of Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ ders
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ather@@ ed itself &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ ors .
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ dri@@ es &quot; &quot; has prompted land Council Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen only on the border to swal@@ low the wind @-@ concentration camp exists .
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city . &quot;
der@@ lei zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; although the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind turbine power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but that had not approved the district government Düsseldorf , because of a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; by the lack of planned legal conditions , the authorized approval is un@@ lawful and therefore also rec@@ eded , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
current state of the things : the City Council decided once again on the summer break the wind@@ zentr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still emerging .
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding writing have been entered into the circle since last week , explained a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes her on the occasion to check the issue again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view of current proceedings at the administration Court , the circle was not intended to express themselves in terms of the arg@@ umentation of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NE@@ W re , a subsidiary of NE@@ W , plans to build on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high winds . &quot;
&quot; last year the company had participated in which the city of Vier@@ sen participates , with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large terrain . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this is approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirements of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer there were four four wind turbines for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cras@@ hing together : Frau dies with a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal .
two other people were easily injured .
the Landes@@ straße remained un@@ locked over hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch went out with her car under the accompanying car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an esc@@ ort person 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ ls and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September . &quot;
the Trade Center and the Municipal Institu@@ tions want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 of September to attract the inhabitants for the shopping go into the city center .
&quot; as the president of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; Home Shopp@@ e &quot; weekend is to sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers for this , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; the market is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite to &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ nights &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only related to residents of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation were commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the acquisition weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
city administration and trade unions cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; this means that the trade unions and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; day @-@ day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ selling Sunday , discussions with all commercial operators and hosts , to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the renoun@@ cement on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als are to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals have lost the city centre when shopping out of sight .
&quot; in the end , all of them must contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city centre - up to landlords , the businesses of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it was to overcome using a network the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which took partly wider , had said king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared that on the nationwide third &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; day , five Th@@ ür@@ inger cities will participate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ cre@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ ves &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and promote its importance to the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot;
the promotion of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence its sales behaviour itself .
two dead and several wounded after an explosion at US school
while construction came to a gas station in the school building .
new other people have been injured .
&quot; there are two people killed at a gas cus@@ hion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , some of them have been wounded , some of them are difficult . &quot;
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a hur@@ t@@ ful in critici@@ zed state .
a man died as part of a school building in the explosion .
a first mixed lot was later also dead .
the dead were the employees of the school .

&quot; at the holiday season only a few people stopped in the building of the shores of Minne@@ haha . &quot;
Tr@@ ump headed by telep@@ hon@@ ed tran@@ scription by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border .
tran@@ scription by phone calls from US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone line with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to to quit , publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President sh@@ utt@@ led him because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; &quot; This can not tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump compet@@ ed his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first attack with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ ist , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence of the trade , who was sent by the government Obama to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban to the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ ist , &quot; that is the most uncomfortable phone call for all day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists conduct rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice back
&quot; one 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ inks to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ b - a man middle aged in a pin@@ ching strip - took a long move on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ isk of the man .
&quot; ho@@ l it from the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ams , the silence , when a young black man was torn away from the passenger &apos;s seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on 22 July , was only a post . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown , nearly all in the audience enjoyed very real epide@@ m@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizenship to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was ever indicted because of the murder .
&quot; it really is in@@ tangible that the only person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt road on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year former congress of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
&quot; for him , the post @-@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that it has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want the ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get into healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot;
a court of medical practitioner places a beg@@ gar on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI @-@ A@@ ts , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Bow@@ men were susp@@ icious in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody ever was charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects stay at an open foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made a decision for the first time in Georgia for the first time to give their voice to the op@@ tionally in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as choosing st@@ ach , according to the details of the F@@ BI of the black bul@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white base owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said , the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby who carried her not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free mal@@ com from prison , thus the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they went away from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , around a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b &apos;s car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a comm@@ oti@@ ons between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , expressed evidence and dec@@ eived the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks have been formulated even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a franchise massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual desc@@ endant of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their portra@@ yal is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the mo@@ ver , because we will be confronted with whose her@@ al@@ ness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build up a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen or hear , what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day there were nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of the Black - into a room and lou@@ dly , as Gre@@ ene got a well @-@ played overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief Executive Officer for many years , but he said the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester &apos;s cry and pus@@ hes it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- , swal@@ lowed by my property ! &quot;
sha@@ cona wi@@ gs the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , Gre@@ ene said , always cold . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- &apos; .
&quot; but , funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and this is exactly where the energy in space , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everybody is busy doing this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends non @-@ violent and fast .
&quot; there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a funeral dress , stands out about the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays sad &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks down on every second word .
about one hundred metres behind it there is a group of about four dozen viewers and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come just down the road . &quot;
they have experienced all almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ pressing moisture when Broo@@ ks will carry them on a pilgrimage to the excav@@ ators of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands on the same land where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air felt like a table . &quot;
&quot; as the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ects the body . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken at their heads , record the fake blood and the breastfeeding body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , when he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and wi@@ ping its tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ mt two of his fellow players and then breaks in her arms we@@ eping together the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , whis@@ pering one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience gets together with actors for dinner together .
sitting at a table a white pair from Atlanta excited about the post@@ ures with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski strug@@ gled to find words which left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the mo@@ b still goes on , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today the only Police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks yard in his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ position is inspiring in some ways , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we do not learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own story , is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Arma@@ ged@@ don &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental works , director Frank Cast@@ or@@ f is set up on a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e performance in front of a gigantic , six @-@ storey backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the rotating stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) op@@ tionally displays a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from DDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ classic car park in which the R@@ hen@@ ish was more pos@@ e@@ er than rock , or alternatively a I@@ sett@@ a . &quot;
stu@@ d oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that runs through his &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ tz@@ e - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise like in the &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ ered the Sie@@ g@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , sh@@ attered in Hollywood Man@@ ier a body in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the splendid fi@@ ery Ha@@ gen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ wheel box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he pl@@ ung@@ ed Sie@@ g@@ fried .
later even Gun@@ ther ( Mark Ei@@ che ) must believe .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; stor@@ my celebrated is Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , which is modest and laid hands on the Merkel &apos;s rob@@ bery . &quot;
&quot; the great applause for the festival , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in le@@ ased recreational clothing . &quot;
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ or@@ f and his director .
&quot; if he had to leave a hill @-@ concert concert in 2013 , there were five years later great Ju@@ bel , in which the single &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; were under@@ went . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said briefly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ or@@ f , but also an understanding of its perspective . &quot;
I draw a positive res@@ ignation .
Max crowd works as a volunteer
you are working in their volunte@@ ering year at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture store , once a week I hel@@ per here in Gre@@ ats in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I worked on the school already in the open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; you are now 26 years , so a late @-@ appointed volunteer . &quot;
how does it happen ?
quantity : I have done ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineering studies , we say very successfully . &quot;
I have known for me that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked me what you do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight there you can see how it can be on site , in the focal point maybe too . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social welfare in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study , I will probably do in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker and studi@@ ere at Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not uncommon to have several different locations during the Volun@@ te@@ er ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always comes to where to make his FS@@ J .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim to youth @-@ work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could see and see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
unlike in the engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about reck@@ oning . &quot;
one always has other people in front of each other &apos;s head who have a very different story behind them .

&quot; a self @-@ filled att@@ un@@ ner has attacked a military con@@ voy at the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , one soldiers of Nato killed and several others hurt . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured and shared an explanation of Nato .
&quot; un@@ confirmed local reports , according to the incident of Q@@ arab@@ h , were also three civilians . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan made this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a self @-@ rep@@ ell@@ ent two people were killed near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is said to happen the explosion on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; by persons &quot; impro@@ vised sprin@@ ting . &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable state are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital at the Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group that is known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations figures , there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;

EPA returns decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule according to suits .
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , what the states are oblig@@ ated to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states for@@ ge the Agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ers 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to work with countries . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our governmental partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which a part of the country must be measured to specify where inc@@ isions must be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , ran@@ ged on Tuesday and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drop a wide range of environmental issues that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of Democrats and reserves that concern themselves about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA says that the creation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; the lung function &quot; , &quot; and the atoms can be strengthened &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants Community space
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : with two counterparts of the council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a common area in the future residence of the residence . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing piece was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it will still last until the part of the church belonging to the church belonging to the church , but there is now no planning event for the project from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion concerning a common area . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the municipality . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living area of approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council of the council in front of such a common room should not only be seen as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent living area , but openly in the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision will be decided by the provision of funding for the current household already last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction lies in the re@@ development area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal is to sign@@ alize the investor that you don &apos;t want to throw him in this respect , that both Satt@@ el@@ - - what has been inspired by a saddle - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach , which makes the pitch @-@ height and makes the construction of economic power - become possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so not only Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously does it happen to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of its own buildings , with which you do not come quite right now , but now they rest in the common room from the window , says : &quot; I do not make myself hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is not interested in the community room - but absolutely against a municipal stake .
it sees behind it a covered sub @-@ invention in any already being &apos;s high @-@ bearing or even foreign investors .
&quot; that is not that way , because with the acquisition of the area , one does not give a grant , but get a real , in doubt of the doubt , the contrary is the contrary . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers application , proposed for the proposed classification , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; with two counterparts in the original program , Stefan H@@ aller follows : &quot; &quot; if we grasp the decision , we make a huge step to close a giant @-@ gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

emig@@ rate in Har@@ z from Stern
in Har@@ z the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; is created .
this is planning the Association Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; an &quot; star path &quot; come to the needy of many hard@@ ships , was called it . &quot;
&quot; it combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set up the scheduled route along the planned route and inform on stars and star pictures .
&quot; in a first phase till 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; I would ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
&quot; therefore , at the location of choice of choice , a good mobile network reception plays a role . &quot;
also Acces@@ sibility is an criterion .
later the star@@ ch path is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ch path the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , even though he is far further away . &quot;
&quot; in which constellation can be convey@@ ed , in which constellation can be found out of a chosen star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been operating in the Swiss town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 .
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the federal government &apos;s specifications for the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy can be seen with naked eye .
in the Un@@ i @-@ city there has been at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen something similar to the planned star - the planetary path .
&quot; beginning before Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extrater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ ards ( community equ@@ als ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the st@@ amping with the individual planets - including the ti@@ d@@ warf @-@ based Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink so on a bul@@ let of 6.5 mil@@ lim@@ etres in diameter while the exact 75 meters removes the sun at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light is required from sun to the planet of Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would last a half year .

&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I went up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to shut down on light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
that is for the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko voted .
&quot; bo@@ xing needs this struggle . &quot;
&quot; climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ by @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko will fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year in order to make the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ weight @-@ introduction in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ by @-@ view mode , because all fans after him have asked , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed later openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he treasures Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the Tri@@ angle champion from River@@ side see &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry for me ... you would like the co @-@ Aus . &quot;

&quot; this is the struggle , which must be carried out . &quot;
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters and this is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured to tire
with an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were badly injured .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost their control over his vehicle until 16.@@ 30 , shortly before the connecting market . &quot;
&quot; the car turned to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he was over@@ thrown and then left on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four races - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured due to the rescue service , A7 was locked in the direction north for about one hour , then the traffic could be passed on to the left lane at the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triangle chain works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optim@@ isation of def@@ ences into Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first seasonal game , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , because not the two oppos@@ ites at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit into Au@@ e yet better , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triangle has to be further optimized .
and one door after a Fre@@ ist@@ o@@ ß want the continu@@ ances also no longer .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ dimensional chain , than with the four @-@ dimensional chain . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ hel@@ m Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we just have in the triple @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build well &quot; , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; it is the prerequisite , however , that we do even better harmon@@ ise and we do not do so much error in building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot speak after an accident , it does not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly speak of a decent season . &quot;
of that his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season assessed only after six to eight game days , &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Fun@@ kel , who would not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abandoned prematurely because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can virtually begin the season with a home game , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her , since they had no he@@ avier and complete game such as Fort@@ una against a Ascension fav@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Interior Defense of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; while guests from the Rhein@@ land leave the Rhein@@ land as an easy favourite on Sunday , at last ( almost ) the stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ pt away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ alism , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose record in only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second division that one has to hit from the outset , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Chief . &quot;
&quot; such a statement to meet would be arrogan@@ t and adul@@ ter@@ ous . &quot;
and so he wants to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ application tests
&quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzle medic@@ in@@ al@@ res@@ et ) has started performing the tests last year .
&quot; they should make the assessment of the age more precisely during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( migrant res@@ ellers ) was critici@@ zed because of errors in assessing the correct ages of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , the Migr@@ ations has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person &apos; may be 18 years or older .
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person may be aged under 18 years old .
the tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan id@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistently resistant in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person was assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has been over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the study was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det published the 5@@ 81 findings , it stated that in 243 these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical retirement assessment , in the x @-@ ray @-@ rays of We@@ ar @-@ teeth and MR@@ I have been analysed by knee arthritis , which are then analyzed by dental implants and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
skep@@ tical is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ olin@@ ska @-@ Institut whose work encompasses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say the risk of judging a child as adults un@@ correct . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of emphasis was placed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ ights , Building at the department of road freight and traffic in the governing board of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three public bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the construction is planned for October , and it is certain that the timing is respected . &quot;
&quot; coming to the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aults bridge from concrete , which is cloth@@ ed with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stone and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now circul@@ ated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on Wednesday morning a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ücken@@ cap .
&quot; this is a boundary , which is also used as an operating track . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meters wide bridge can be inserted on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian prec@@ edes then .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patent @-@ magne@@ ts .
special finger@@ tips has the embarrass@@ ment of wir@@ es by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires .
because there is also a fibre cable that are connected to many companies .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ note about the project .
&quot; in addition , we had to leave fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first . &quot;
for the bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ Buil@@ dings and the collective @-@ consecr@@ ation in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic lights .
&quot; for construction work on the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road is fully locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ ge@@ es is between 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ d in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
&quot; it does not happen so often that parties prefer to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ d ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , Left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows on this day peace@@ full flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ at the loud poster &quot; &quot; great election campaign &quot; &quot; invites . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , will form the top directors of the Bundestag on 24 September , and the Deputy Prime Minister of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on @-@ site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ d , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place in the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of those who come to the Af@@ d event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that is there .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum One World and one of the main organizers , was really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad &quot; , &quot; which could also eat the Af@@ d , &quot; says the woman having brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have moved many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ d come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes tells of the Af@@ gan@@ ean volcanoes , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but a cancellation received because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there is not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; therefore the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 20 o &apos;clock there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , including the Rhine @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall , approximately 200 list@@ eners who are waiting to wait for the leaders of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is also short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police cannot move - no special incidents .

&quot; a re @-@ heard with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ lists Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there are in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea to Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Bal@@ can@@ folklore &quot; &quot; hits a classic German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both Sol@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European excellence .
this is so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ ks the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire to cross not only the boundaries on their instruments , but to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach at the two like in a new format , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ trav@@ eller , Classi@@ cal , jazz , and free games to a fascinating total of art . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ itt wrote it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with its special acousti@@ cs is deliberately included in the concert .
Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I would like to try out everything , &quot; says Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart quite openly about their bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I play in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next to the next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ au@@ stars was that of her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who was ultimately bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this ass@@ ures the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine &quot; &quot; I was in every serious love , whom I was done . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten was too that she bis@@ exual said : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism and seriously believed it . &quot;
so it has never been confused or ham@@ pered .
I only liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; particularly below , they suffered loud &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but at school times when they prefer to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really makes me very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven the children said to me , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I was really attacked and ashamed .
&quot; now I look back and think of me , &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they do not like to share their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and upset me .
&quot; and perhaps I refer to some as und@@ ank@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the general public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and thinking about thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic Governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously spoke a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice made not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was voted in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal mining in five states , and inherited from his father a coal @-@ shop . &quot;
he is about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation , in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democracy party which would be more likely to be working as a great deal to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice just the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance , and unable to find a positive , little message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement the CB@@ S News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the worldwide leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as revealed excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ h said during the IA@@ AF Congress , on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments agreed at the IA@@ AF Congress to maintain the ban , which in November 2015 was app@@ ended , after a report of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( W@@ ada ) had found references to state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ president Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for himself , that they experienced some pretty hot times and do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; he said that Russia also enjoys &quot; &quot; joy &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; ninete@@ en Russian athletes are at the athle@@ tics world Championships , which begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria than neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; there are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said Re@@ por@@ ters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral pact for Mali cras@@ hed soldiers
&quot; during a funeral celebration in the north@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two have taken into a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral under high security precautions .
&quot; yet , the Minister of Defense Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; they referred to the two inver@@ ters , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are accused of this highest sacrifice that they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come alive on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
her S@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and was accompanied by a mur@@ derer by the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
&quot; at mid@@ day , only the relatives were in the church goodbye . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral party began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
&quot; trau@@ matic ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the loved ones kept his arm in arm to the S@@ är@@ gen . &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen awarded the reverse soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and en@@ rolled .
the rod cat@@ er@@ mann have built the flight operation of the batt@@ ling helicop@@ ters tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with and be one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his Reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not aver@@ t the crash , then it would not have missed . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed Minister of the Le@@ yen not : the use was dangerous .
&quot; but it is also of high significance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the spar@@ row were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr took no information . &quot;
prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried in his wife because of his wife . &quot;
he shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish king@@ ship is placed in the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard was already a sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
&quot; the Queen was in agreement with the decision of her husband , meant it further in the message . &quot;
where prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be not yet unclear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French home .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he went into retirement , and he also lays the title &quot; prin@@ t@@ ma@@ hl . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - also not after death , said L@@ ene Ballet , the boss of the Danish royal house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be placed in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; the Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Thames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , the prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 years . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography vo@@ iced Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ aps instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked in instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and that in this country , the reputation had the reputation of soci@@ o@@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for you . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed happy to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to re@@ election rapid new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; precip@@ itation Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red green government multi@@ tudes for a quick re@@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to withdraw . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Greens members from their agricultural survey in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce A @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the old Greens dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests established its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election of 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ hat@@ ch ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to take it up .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new land@@ day will be reg@@ ained regulatory on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to reign in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l keeps it indispensable for the landing day as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U @-@ group is expected to decide on further action on Tuesday .
the Landes@@ bank also sees the possibility that the parliament &apos;s Day draws the confidence of the Prime Minister and choose a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be legally checked and tested , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said . &quot;
they will be deb@@ ated in silence all questions when they are legally checked .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ wes@@ ens step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os .
the policy @-@ erin itself said : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it referred to as a tag of black @-@ green .
the Green called for the ab@@ omin@@ ous dep@@ uties for the return of their country convention .
&quot; of course , we assume that they have received their country house , which they receive over the green state list , with immediate effect returns , &quot; the Landes@@ presidents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the presidents of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
they have deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; also against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot track this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the crossing of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green parliament@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behavior of the former Greens members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red green , &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to let the country day quickly re @-@ vote . &quot;
the leaving T@@ wes@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in its last van@@ ity and in her frustration , her personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue , and tries to propose political capital . &quot;
&quot; low @-@ fac@@ eted CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members , El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , drafted T@@ v@@ ests , with personal career think the result of the Sunday &apos;s election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the SPD strongest force , SPD and Greens in the country , but a hau@@ led majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; agriculture ministers in an interview - How can we protect ourselves against g@@ ills , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed over poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
&quot; in the interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial department . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect against poll@@ uted eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer goods and consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp printing .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ den .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the latest information on the eggs Char@@ ge concerned . &quot;
the affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we currently know , a health danger is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di is taking the best possible crisis campaign - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tening of the Federal Minister , is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and is based on the war@@ dness of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade also has the same as the manufacturer to bear care that the products sold traffic @-@ capable and health are harmless .
&quot; if in case of eggs the resi@@ dual levels of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not accessible . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the companies to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the line of knowledge the production facilities apply no immediate fault .
&quot; rather , on the basis of mut@@ in@@ compar@@ ably illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little controversi@@ es in the harvest case .
is there only a lack of personnel or also in conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
but it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; for truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent clarification of such events and the transfer to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in cases where crimes can exist , are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made a clear understanding of the responsible authorities in charge of the responsible authorities .
is the regular alar@@ mis@@ m at food labels really necessary ?
consumer goods and consumers have the right to only get safe and sustainable foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ operation insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food economy , consumer goods and consumers are entitled to law . &quot;
&quot; due to the pan@@ demic means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are advised to get into a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ cides in the attitude of food delivery means is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; this has to be done on all levels , and be working with high pressure . &quot;
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is quickly and incomplete .
how the financial rules of the pedestrian on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not disturbing . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will still come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power , teams of access to the prestigious champi@@ ons league tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair @-@ play rules , which were launched in 2011 from the UEF@@ A , mean that P@@ SG will eventually prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without large losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million Euros ( 26@@ 2 million Euros ) to redeem the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; P@@ SG can make sure the money is loose , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar signs and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy of wealthy rulers of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to use a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be subject to legitimate sources of revenue which allow them to take off the Bre@@ ak @-@ Even in their on the football business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Pl@@ ini after his election as the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ki@@ fied to ruin , if banks or owners returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debts of clubs for the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel demo@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then strongly invested in order to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , its UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander will continue to dis@@ miss the Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in to do so . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared with The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the P@@ SG paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat bowl , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sol@@ ub@@ ility can be submitted for the next five years in the amount of € 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the P@@ SG together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
the P@@ SG received a penalty of EUR 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players of the otherwise normal 25 players .
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ list its financial supervision by selling their revenue by companies , who are linked to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could exceed the P@@ SG when the value of the sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rate , the UEF@@ A would not apply as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of the P@@ SA was b@@ anded by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the P@@ SG @-@ payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar could come .
but P@@ SG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will become and such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could simply find out .
&quot; the previous sanctions against P@@ SG means that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , every attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with P@@ SG about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke at the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the P@@ SG situation . &quot;
the last published reports indicate that P@@ SG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
&quot; P@@ SG expected that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrive a bo@@ on for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot . &quot;
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly mistaken to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s departure by claiming that P@@ SG would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financing dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the Club and the State , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of the latter owner of P@@ SG . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the funding Fair@@ play , because one can find different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is on the lookout for a new trial supplier

&quot; however , more important is the advertising effect : for a gun manufacturer , it is a prestigious order . &quot;
&quot; how many applicants are in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to reveal . &quot;
but only Swiss producers come in question .
&quot; according to the report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
for the S@@ DA the largest Swiss Cho@@ colate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .

&quot; this repetition of history is also nostal@@ g@@ ically due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge era ( as the pre@@ acher David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age the Sk@@ et@@ ch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ten ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as an cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally an o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
but as a franchise it feels like the time would fall short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd Hum@@ or ( it contained a original history for a promising pants , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by taking on the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle ages play dirty children that will grow , nevertheless they still attract the im@@ possibility to return the last part of the weather . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the plumage principle , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker @-@ Films of the 90 @-@ he years as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point st@@ bert a character through a Apple Power@@ Book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gracious Coop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy &apos; mal@@ ign@@ ant p@@ lot that is included in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well known impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the courses of the best part of franchise .
&quot; it makes especially much fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ avi@@ lions Gate by &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy looks like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of random madness that could cause this franchise like a type of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reached what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; the last scene will show the gang of &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , on Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ West ring @-@ icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two poli@@ c@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main wheels - a hard @-@ fed Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced to English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police spends the time to watch chess on TV , how Americans might do it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out . &quot;
&quot; but Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer which carries a Re@@ agan @-@ mask , is involved - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it takes place , and the com@@ edy is not fast or common enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , who has been re@@ funded to a lower length , could deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re better , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef still visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ oured a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the psych@@ ic communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for for@@ age for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian Creator was not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Black @-@ Forest @-@ B@@ aar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched out , as the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office Convention on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 15 , 15 accus@@ ation were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and en@@ acted against this . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials presented larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , black@@ weapons , and several hundreds of thousands of thousands . &quot;
at the same time swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there was German arrest warrant .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 poli@@ c@@ emen were deployed . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia is organised crime criminal , heavy violence , trying murder as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office was determined against organised drug trafficking in the South German region . &quot;
&quot; between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the great use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
the investigations of the investigations declined mainly Italian nationality with a close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account . &quot;
wor@@ ris@@ king large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data of citizens who should not arise . &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner shows considerable shortcomings in Germany . &quot;
the lead to partly grave failures in asylum proceedings .
&quot; for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jur@@ gen , a media report is repor@@ tedly attentive to large gaps in the Aus@@ centric register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the registered data might result in asylum proceedings and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; partly gra@@ zing wrong decisions , &quot; they warned in an analysis that the &quot; South German Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , according to ten million people with foreign nation@@ als , there are about 5.4 million people from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found &quot; &quot; of people who have long since become more of life , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data retention can be retri@@ ev@@ ed back @-@ returns processes greatly , &quot; says the report after . &quot;
statistics on incoming people are covered by EU citizens who would not have to leave .
&quot; but such false rules , however , led to a distorted debate about how to deal with the trav@@ eller , &quot; says therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government has apparently begun to return to Italy for refugee @-@ families with the 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this brings forth from an internal paper of the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , the BAM@@ F lead to such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and infants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , the paper was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; following the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach it first . &quot;
&quot; when a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the travelling country . &quot;
&quot; for the reason the office now write : &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy increased significantly . &quot;
Italy gave for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) have kept these promises for sufficient .
other EU states would also return to refugees in the framework of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internally political speaker in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children threatened because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system deserted un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to the child &apos;s child . &quot;
two @-@ way results achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood of in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people were already available for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; in all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 50 lit@@ res of blood with its now 100 contributions . &quot;
traditionally appreci@@ ates the community in the meeting of the council the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is genius , how our body is laid out for it , and we appl@@ aud the donations that provide their blood for strangers , even more un@@ selfish , &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood don@@ ating helps several men , &quot; explained the governor of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preserves are de@@ composed into their components . &quot;
so many people could benefit from a blood don@@ or .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported on the actions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 donations , the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ Kreis@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in the theatre &apos;s change led to higher number of years ago . &quot;
&quot; earlier , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer for the multi@@ fac@@ en@@ dar@@ s and were awarded for 50 employees . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , during Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mmer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefan@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter ten times per 500 milli@@ liters of their life @-@ juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates of 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will probably be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation would have absorbed the spec@@ ulations of an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; when the interest rates on family income fall in the middle of one intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 in 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary budget would continue , while the inflation in the fall is likely to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that over the next few years , Zin@@ ser@@ tation would need to grow inflation and she said that the credit costs may need to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic package , which was issued a year after Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for finance plan to provide financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the real income of households will continue to be charged the consumption . &quot;
&quot; interest rates reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be required for cooling down inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; extent than the markets expected . &quot;
markets predicted the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank stressed however , that increases are &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year , compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % . &quot;
she has maintained its growth forecasts on 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint growth rates have absorbed the rising expectations of interest @-@ making , and GDP increased in the second quarter of 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth will be expected to be 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by a rising inflation and low @-@ day salary , since the tigh@@ tening is still worse , before it will improve . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy may not prevent the income in the next few years &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds resulting from lower consumption expendi@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the failure . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for Zin@@ ser@@ tion was increased , since inflation increased the pressure on hard and increased budgets , with three political decision makers in July increased a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the inflation has declined from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected and put it on in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the crossing in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; to the weak pound weight . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent set@@ back of the s@@ wap racks , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders are strongly seeking businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly well for those where the existing de@@ als run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against financing of the medicine in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformation &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ risk pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk from high risk pro@@ phyla@@ xis by around 86 percent , is now delivered from healthcare service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he is prepared to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice , that the N@@ HS had authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP in spite of the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the Chess Federation announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health hospitals in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to make the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in all of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV supplements which will be taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP is significantly reduced HIV transmission during infection types .
taking Pr@@ EP in front of sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so already two hours before intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question are gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified appropriate participants who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gres@@ sions and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
people who live in England and registered at a household physician can also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the program will be signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs during this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP in evaluating clinical evidence on how it is targeted on a large scale , implemented and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and exceed the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to preventing HIV .
&quot; it is another milestone in which more than three decades of continuing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted on appropriate and dangerous people , the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; in September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority has to be held that the study will quickly be performed throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk to HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP test medicine was introduced , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delays and hesit@@ ant implementation through the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence show how transforming this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention can be and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is done as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people that are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the end of spreading HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the great life living : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court flat in a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a great house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack their bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my prize .
&quot; I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I have fallen in love with her and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square feet large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a one bedroom property with a closed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add yo@@ anne storage space and a mezz@@ anine to use the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill that 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms at one another , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to solve the record .
&quot; the steel construction is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so we were over@@ ed , without having to drop us . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to attach the steel so that he had the right height for the function or below . &quot;
this arrangement allowed it Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezz@@ anine a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illum@@ ination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to let him work longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ rors feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units for all cut@@ ler@@ s and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; by perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering started inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so it is when you slide the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base surface - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a rudi@@ mentary form a real estate agent will occur , and a calculation based on the size size will perform . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to enlarge the floor space , while using high quality materials , which gives the room its luxury advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself into the electric plu@@ gs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square footage of some standard into something very special .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US @-@ dollar property .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a debate due to one of the biggest property imperial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as valued at more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to retreat from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation finds in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers spent 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family in 1973 bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - was described by Paul as the main operator and the dominating personality in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court record that this means that Col@@ in ownership is owned by 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has been proven for Paul as a problem .
&quot; those proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him with what I held for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , after several failed plac@@ ings took place , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , like Paul claims to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues this is not true , but raises Paul mainly to manage some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to set the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage is writing that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy of the late 1950 @-@ er years and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early seven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ load of the family opened . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me , that he never wanted to end the brothers to trial , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that Mark were paid for 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , Paul &quot; said about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back although he was a former AF@@ L Executive Board and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really cannot say much , &quot; &quot; because the case was before the dishes . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to mo@@ urn and to pull our family name through the dishes &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in writing to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our Father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he will still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
&quot; tri@@ umps of new staff , plans to restrict the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President . &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
Poli@@ tico reports that the new staff member of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on an equ@@ itable course .
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new leader of the White House , met with leading employees , he set up a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wants to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brie@@ f@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to count tr@@ ump by monitoring its media coverage . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship with television last decades back - and now , where it is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Candi@@ date was angry because of a unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were persu@@ aded , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam Nun@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise price . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridiculous . &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets would have even more ig@@ nition .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
&quot; if his staff made it a couple of times , to hold trouble from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump controversi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that the people in a white house consists of competing parties , repeatedly try to move their own agenda by using tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world . &quot;
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to inform the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example which was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press pages , especially such with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks and to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that happened at the end of February , when someone accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ vocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy rod in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile to be of Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was ban@@ ished permanently from Twitter because of Schi@@ kan@@ en , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then rod Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ ers still strive to influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make cell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ searched criminals get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hoped . &quot;
the police in whole Europe sent to this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crime on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the searched sword @-@ bre@@ cher is not known , according to the population , they will up@@ lift and pray information from the population . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , following the &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; Adv@@ entures of the winter on the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many addic@@ ts to holiday destinations were hidden , it meant by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries have put together .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ asis has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online gest@@ ures could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic owners of the West Mid@@ lands come again with some determined travellers on war @-@ foot which took part of the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch to rep@@ el a field in front of their manor houses .
&quot; the travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; million@@ aire @-@ series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , having been thrown out until May , without being de@@ tained by one of the council of excav@@ ation to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tactical group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their cars through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said that it is &quot; useless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are drawn on Monday night after they were sent on from Bentley He@@ ath where they were cast stones on the pedest@@ rians . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , moved further and are now back again . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; The Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common dest@@ ress , if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a inhabitants who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridiculous we just have seen the last round of these travelers , just to lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; said a spokes@@ person on Soli@@ h@@ ull &apos;s coun@@ sel : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a dirt camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling on 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is born .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the hotel bir@@ ch , the ambience of the hotel bir@@ ch was lost for 13 April 2014 and was lost about 30 000 nights per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , a dramatic increase in the numbers of refugees who came to the country , provided the hotel building as a collection of accommodation , provided for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ outs has acquired the former Hotel bir@@ ch in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers and one in Bad Con@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel bir@@ ch has been standing in front of the entrance for a longer period of time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were ri@@ pped out , blankets to the part disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do in March .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is converted , there will be new windows installed . &quot;
&quot; all sol@@ le later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; will express like Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , empha@@ sizes ev@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms wants to set up broadly , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million Euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; even the outside facilities are brought on the front of the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace which is accessed by the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
&quot; Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Representative , Grand Jury &quot;
&quot; in Russia &apos;s affair , by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Representative Robert Mu@@ eller is to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report . &quot;
&quot; in the past few weeks , the panel received work in the last few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; among the calling for trusted persons . &quot;
the paper analyses the step as a sign that mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigation .
&quot; the transm@@ itter CN@@ N reported , there were already the first pre@@ lad@@ le of the Gre@@ mi@@ um related to a meeting between Tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; US intelligence services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin since longer , targeted in the presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were evenings between the m@@ umps of the campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special er@@ ers Tr@@ ump was personally involved in the centre and seek the accus@@ ation , whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide the evidence in possible dispute cases , and decide whether it should be charged . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called acc@@ using .
mostly they are switched on when it deals with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office to pre @-@ charge people for use under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the channel CN@@ N , pre @-@ Lad@@ in were already issued to rot@@ ate the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to be asked to give a statement on the report called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also tr@@ umps advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort on the interview .
&quot; experts said on Thursday evening on Thursday , that the installation show that Mu@@ eller will not be intimid@@ ated in his work and that he should be necessary to act fast . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the acquisition of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he does not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work also usually in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House advocate any actions that accelerated the work of the special supplier in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey have told three times that not to be determined against the president .
&quot; you have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this cast , allegations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he would like to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; he said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump made him an attitude of investigations against the former national security advis@@ ors Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure for the investigation .
&quot; according to the representation of U.S. media , the White House material gathered against the Special Off@@ ers and its employees . &quot;
&quot; the extingu@@ ished spec@@ ulations about it , whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was released . &quot;
&quot; unlike an independent manufacturer of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , around the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position where he could be fired at the D@@ ur@@ ging of the President of the Minister of Justice . &quot;
several transm@@ issions of both parties want to bow to such a step however .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented law@@ suits on Thursday , according to those who could not be dis@@ missed so easily . &quot;
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg is driving in the Antarc@@ tic
&quot; in the west Antarc@@ tic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has solved itself from the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for polar@@ isation and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large pist@@ on is now up north and will probably take two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the biggest ice cream , the researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ice@@ berg , is unclear according to researchers . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there has been a series of unusual inter@@ break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be combined with heating . &quot;
the broken col@@ os@@ sus had so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it thus grows further into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this swe@@ ar was the balance of wa@@ xes and abor@@ tion a few years ago .
&quot; a complete sh@@ ele@@ e is to be broken there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to do so that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the present@@ ers have never withdrawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate is under tension and could fall down , if at a key point a piece dis@@ bur@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ swe@@ is and ice@@ berg not raises the level of sea , as it is floating on the water and pus@@ hes ice so much water as it results after the melt itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the swe@@ ar leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers are able to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level of sea , but only in the slight dimensions , writes the British research project for watching the Antarc@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is after AW@@ I @-@ Information with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the four @-@ largest swe@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antarc@@ tic .
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the king@@ sign comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the widest withdrawal from the beginning of records , he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i will now grow back or put together in the long run , and possibly summar@@ ize , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researchers did not lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ice@@ berg not to climate change , so in recent decades many of the ice @-@ gl@@ aring of the Antarc@@ tic . &quot;
this long tail of the Antarc@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the polar region of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has gone back around 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
the temperature has been contributed to the decline .
&quot; over the past 50 years , the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus among the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ rigi@@ if at staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy clear positions , the CD@@ U calls to step out of the employer , to become more attractive . &quot;
only just before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has spar@@ ked 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the government administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind him . &quot;
the teachers at the circle are apparently very popular .
approximately 6@@ 20 applications were to be noted for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is lacking further personnel to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 registered positions at the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of the general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to put the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G to take the initiative and face the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; according to the request of the parties , the management should develop &quot; a concept for recruitment and recruitment development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but towards future @-@ oriented of the applicants , it is said . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a balance sheet , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has to do with staff problems , which you did not know earlier . &quot;
other cities advertise good officials and employees and provide more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a down@@ right &quot; contest of public employers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age difference from the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time to action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; yet , Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond his party with his party . &quot;
he did not have long since in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a worth@@ less surprise when he was publicly available to the personnel of personnel and the remaining parties per@@ ple@@ te .
&quot; peoples wants that all possibilities are checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employer . &quot;
&quot; if we do not arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the government administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - must strive towards a Hau@@ rigi@@ if . &quot;
&quot; with this , the CD@@ U attempts to pay better the employees and officials as it is the collective bar@@ gain for public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently required , increases , or more money is only if you change into a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees are concerned about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes . &quot;
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers have Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ kultur@@ tor Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the sound to NGO @-@ migrants b@@ ail@@ out
&quot; Italy , NGOs , b@@ ail@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they are not allowed to continue , if they do not stop new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ority &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized the German aid organisation &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had collabor@@ ated effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express themselves to comprehensive allegations of the Italian pro@@ secutor of Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we cannot estimate any accus@@ ations , which are currently being collected , after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had surv@@ eyed the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ tet , &quot; which monitors I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that smug@@ gler can drive them up , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such an encounter found only 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Public Pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected to over@@ take over the authority of the Italian coastal , b@@ ail@@ out in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motiv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first have an Italian police officers on board who supervis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; to their life@@ times . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti said now that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , in recent weeks that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with the local citizens are fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives , with Ch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that can leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine cros@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin State posts &quot; and two host@@ ers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Palat@@ inate , to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , one of which one could look far over the Palat@@ ine forest and the anter@@ ior plains . &quot;
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long Tri@@ als .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the popular saus@@ age market .
&quot; again , lookout point at the lookout point , connected by &quot; flo@@ cks &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
over the last two days there were many high altitude metres earlier .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refreshment are welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker in the open @-@ free con@@ dol@@ ences of cur@@ ative Sole .
also new town was controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 al@@ timeter , the group had known the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest of its best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundesliga gears up for e @-@ sport
&quot; sport @-@ stars will be sitting in the future of computer consoles , instead of fighting for wind and weather through the stadium ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high passages . &quot;
they have also recognized the first federal government to become increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport @-@ Department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game of FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that there are still several clubs on this train .
&quot; the next weekend of the World Cup , FIFA in London organizes the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs are competing against each other . &quot;
&quot; for example , besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven are qualified . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advising a Agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract you could be present online by far more often on these markets than once in the year to send to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; play computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the soccer simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport also , Li@@ gen established , where the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in 2006 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a right sport @-@ art ?
for many people the idea is safe .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bers has long been dealing with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is funny and many biological and physical reactions show that one can also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress levels , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive abilities need , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction ability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , f@@ rob@@ ats also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult through online play , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport l@@ acked . &quot;
the scientist highlights the high @-@ inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; the players are internationally on the way , this is like a great global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural events . &quot;
a study of the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Enter@@ t@@ ein@@ ment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in this way , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
sales will be 130 million in three years .
&quot; indeed , against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundesliga . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far away from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already further .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ bases Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ sport competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot in Europe .
&quot; in a Norwegian school it was introduced e @-@ sport as a teaching , he says F@@ rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France the soccer league associations , according to D@@ utt , are now oblig@@ ated to set up an E @-@ Sport @-@ Department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Management Board of Rö@@ tt@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to fall into nostal@@ gia and clear the old days , today is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but the company will be able to focus on the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; says also D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can not stick to it , that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics to push Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ icide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend with texts and calls for su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction under G@@ it@@ ters and five years were exposed to currency . &quot;
Carter was condemned in June due to an experienced kill@@ ings of Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is non @-@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free of charge .
&quot; it had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both it and Mr Roy has suffered from a mental disease . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cre@@ tan bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down , when it was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the pro@@ secutor of the court . &quot;
they ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no re@@ mor@@ als shown . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said , it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circumstance , which she is totally regre@@ tt@@ able . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is &quot; &quot; no day &quot; &quot; at which I don &apos;t be@@ wil@@ dered the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I handle it all . I try , despite all my sor@@ eness that we are carrying for eternity with us , for his sisters there is to be there . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , told that she will never be persecuted by the recognition , &quot; she will never be attending the wedding of her brother or who would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep on my life for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to call up a man to commit su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy has been found dead by a coal @-@ oxid@@ ation in one vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters &apos;s text releases , revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging around , spring of a building , first e@@ che yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many paths , &quot; she said in several messages that she sent during the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide wrote her : &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; and &quot; All what you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter is looking for the death of Roy and arranged that they would benefit by any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; for the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 because of the murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserve sympathy and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ing : learning about the new mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run as captain for me at the Audi Cup as captain is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern Trust the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation was not ashamed .
&quot; what was different in his place in the cabin , which Joshua saw me immediately , even if the extra piece of garments was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi crash , no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neu@@ er was seen , he made himself the list@@ ings to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as a Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
well the one could have been able to run better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of coach could also suggest Kim@@ ber@@ ley .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen by you@@ th@@ ers , deb@@ tors and just from vacation to the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader . &quot;
&quot; in the dearest one , the sugar is distributed to those who want to be a lot that you want to keep in the mood . &quot;
&quot; who , who are chosen to compete the legacy of L@@ ame , a small extra motivation can only use good . &quot;
Kim@@ olos confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility .
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ L@@ ame over the field .
&quot; right behind , this is his position , the white as@@ de at the arm did its rest . &quot;
and at all the Kim@@ olos appeared to me as the one who can take the rod also at the best .
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ folded tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
&quot; V@@ idal this , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ te hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches put out on the performances of Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ te also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
all of them were quite good .
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ le , Ru@@ dy was standing in front of the ri@@ f@@ le , both besie@@ ged sovereig@@ n@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the well occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and they tried also successfully in the game building a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy said that the result was &quot; &quot; not so , as we hoped that . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , Tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how un@@ lives this Bavaria world still lives for the re@@ orientation , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for instance gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ bach passed a few cr@@ acking statements on his back to his new fellow @-@ player .
&quot; there he heard a interesting sentence from the South of South America : &quot; &quot; what is happening here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; with Bavaria , you simply have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one . &quot;

company satisfied with the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ onian minister : economy pra@@ ises the Fi@@ xed pace
&quot; it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , has been an economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this shows itself after more than one year , in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
&quot; chambers and businesses from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy , while keeping the old secretary at the same time . &quot;
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy to which Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the largest rever@@ ence for Nat@@ us in infra@@ structural politics : the bridge of highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on top of the country &apos;s primary list .
&quot; again this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 should be the building right . &quot;
&quot; it also plays a role in the country &apos;s plans , it is also playing the West@@ phal@@ ia Tri@@ er , which stands in the pre @-@ urgent need for the retail plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Secretary of Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; with this , Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er seeks to increase the sales of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to start a firm , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Industry . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ skammer Tri@@ er sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is a premium of 1000 Euro for the constitu@@ ent master exam and 2,500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ evident in ten years after the mastery . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country stays long .
&quot; in the planned road building were quick facts to create , at the same time , there was no need for the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan bell , main business leaders of the Chamber of Industry Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust the Wis@@ sing to the State of Mobility , so far only 29 places have been occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Group vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the calcul@@ ator , the country would invest more than 20 million euros in the receipt of country roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band construction is in the country . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey , only 3.4 . &quot;
it makes up @-@ level Internet connections and break@@ downs .
&quot; in contrast , Ex @-@ Economic Affairs in E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group for@@ s@@ ook Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she had already returned the field to four months . &quot;
&quot; Audi is supposed to change 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chairman said , the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; it gives smar@@ ter options as riding restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limiting . &quot;
&quot; Daimler issued on Tuesday , that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described our operations as recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ e@@ mit diesel engines , are considered to be car@@ cin@@ ogenic , and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment for the neutr@@ alisation of the diesel @-@ powered exhaust gases , also take whatever makes it difficult to hold the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with the powerful auto@@ firms to fund and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called shut@@ ters devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules if a car was tested , but at normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees have been charged with Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics were arrested in Germany in the engine development of Audi .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen after the authorities have been accused of dealing with the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request which focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation might strain Volkswagen difficult to load : the luxury car manufacturer contributes proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was temporarily one of the most published Carto@@ on @-@ dra@@ wer , the l@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still remarkable , and works at a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ it@@ Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he proposed himself among other things as an artist for congrat@@ ulation cards by - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris have succeeded in breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris match &quot; and then also in &quot; &quot; Stern &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o found many fans .
ever again the artists of cities inspire .

lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; lavender is due to the lack of remin@@ ding conditions and due to disease @-@ borne insects , which is causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , big head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agri@@ cultural Institute of CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the lifes@@ pan of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ cades , and with very dry weather there are a lot of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lavender oil is not only available for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very important for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of very long vegetable drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered , include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ ing out of soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to drought . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce meet normally in to examine their plans for reporting on recent chaos in the state of Zin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists will discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gran@@ ates , or let them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words to a table on the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the re@@ porter to propose name for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and abs . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smug@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are susp@@ ects on the salary list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of violence , and while in the whole country the bodies cor@@ p@@ ses are am@@ assed : at least 25 , President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to in December 2012 gave his office . 5@@ 89 are on attacks and threats under Bundes@@ schutz and until now there was at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , their editor and the inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep even though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its medi@@ ator with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; hanging at the façade of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the three @-@ thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which seem to be smiling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their nightmare , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 , a probe of journalists was established in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of kill@@ ings that are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the murder@@ ers of journalists are only rarely put in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ east and even though the terrain is now even more disgu@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; without information about the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety requires little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know that , mis@@ trust we all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive it just a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - who was translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ d river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius ran away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to be freely around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ hal@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival@@ ing fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ hal@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of promised , two @-@ story Maus@@ s for drug reg@@ isters , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; remember for a minute that there is a state of &apos; peace &apos; , if only a box control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States has . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought every copy of the output , as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez in it , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country at its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its kill@@ ings will be seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced porter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journalism without b@@ ump into the smoking problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and revenues and publicity . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters , they loved to publish hard pun@@ ching examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &apos; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead . &quot;
he gave himself up that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task of playing as a journalist , either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in view of so many things ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team merged Val@@ dez , the spa @-@ bird , who was like a harbour @-@ bird , the friend who knew generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trusted us on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El C@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there on the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , they wonder : was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also forced them to ask her own assumptions on how they do work best , and they can stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home@@ work and cross @-@ railways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , do not apply in Zin@@ alo@@ a , as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside we searched two poli@@ c@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the poli@@ c@@ emen , who referred to the governor themselves as not trustworthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago since the re@@ porter have gone to the mountain landscape , where drugs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has grown to three main stories .
there was the assassination of brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the State expendi@@ tures and focused on the hometown of the governor .
&quot; there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local drug and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ters from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost the whole century of all political levels . &quot;
several Pr@@ i governors have been accused of criminal off@@ ences for high @-@ quality cases .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the repor@@ ters to write about previous incidents in this Local , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; before we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers who protest against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
Re@@ por@@ mate Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ ap a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Pro@@ secutor .
&quot; in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an , the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an were killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country journalists have become vocal in organized protests in the &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; on sal@@ aries and buildings . &quot;
this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
&quot; at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ hal@@ a , a day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities , repor@@ tedly elect and bring them , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has been asked for the fact that she is re@@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico of organised crime , involved in government officials and a united society . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug companies , but also on the command of politicians and security forces working with the organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you think , because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
&quot; nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as , at the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ ellip@@ as six years ago . &quot;
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas de Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer ta@@ stat@@ ur and ear@@ phones stood next to their separated head .
&quot; some branches have voted to close , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te at the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua for the assassination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach , in March . &quot;
others continue to do as it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do after the assassination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly set up the drug press with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists are fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and are looking for danger . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered by four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the escape of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives up that the drug store him scar@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and that is why I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; by midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and drank of beer , than once all of their phones began . &quot;
a series of shooting with band reefs and security guards near the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a number of cart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge they released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ els near to - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who held the guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose cent@@ er@@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ hal@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its mark . &quot;
&quot; how can you just keep thinking about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when the same day was murdered by Javier , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
dinosau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his sk@@ inn@@ ed skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said , she could have had something of a &quot; &quot; rest@@ ful past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; referred to it as &quot; the possessed @-@ made dinosau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbelie@@ v@@ ably good preserv@@ ative condition has researchers , who describe it as &apos; really remarkable &apos; , start@@ led &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil fuel of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to see more precisely . &quot;
this was discovered by him Fossi@@ l was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animals within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you are only a little with the eyes blin@@ king , you might almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creation is visible . &quot;
&quot; it is going to be in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa , the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this plant e@@ ater is covered , although it is covered with arm@@ aments and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat eating dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , and used par@@ ach@@ ute technology , which is used as a counter@@ balance , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to devi@@ ate its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family made the head@@ lines in May and is now visible in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli named after the Museum@@ ste@@ er Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours . &quot;
&quot; the ast@@ ounding preservation of the specimen made available to Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ ors to document his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ atti@@ res , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature is darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ coloring is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the animals living today is over@@ flowing . &quot;
&quot; it points out that the dinosau@@ rs has enough pressure from meat eating eating dinosau@@ rs , that evolution was fav@@ ored by wearing the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use counter @-@ atti@@ res - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or gir@@ dles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ ors behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs predat@@ ors have to have been &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r red was red .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including its Con@@ ser@@ mon Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the dinosau@@ r , when he died , went out into a river and turned into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ ser@@ ed skin , but also in three dimensions remains intact and the original form of the beast retains &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost as much as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r , which stood on two legs , passed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs became hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons he@@ avier monsters . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology seem to believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been vers@@ had@@ owed by the sea in the sea and in mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the bes@@ ter@@ ess dinosau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops that ra@@ ked by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ aters have been scrat@@ ched by Western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater order of the dinosau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ umpy cor@@ ted plates along the dinosau@@ r cover
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lottery . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ use it . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied res@@ te of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy cor@@ ds that carry the skull of the beast .
&quot; his right front @-@ foot is on his side , his five fingers is pointed upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
fierce accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , long @-@ term st@@ one@@ - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon for about 20 people were injured .
&quot; after the first details of the police were between 5.@@ 00 p.m. and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County of A@@ ich@@ ach Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm of almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks . &quot;
&quot; first , no information about the exact number of injured was first mentioned . &quot;
it is about light to medium @-@ severe injuries , said a Poli@@ ze@@ al @-@ pre@@ cher . &quot;
a great deal of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident point .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
in the direction of driving in Munich there was a few kilometres long relap@@ se .
&quot; as a AZ repor@@ ters , it also came on the bac@@ kl@@ ink to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade is listed , the signs of the vehicles , which have now reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , then a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between an automobile sports and a car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tested &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or it is deep in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
does the creator come and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ us@@ hing or irrit@@ ates the g@@ ast in the middle of the work@@ flow .
postcard control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are passed soon .
the German railways currently test@@ es the creation @-@ free ticket control .
just confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken its place and de@@ values with it the ticket .
currently there is a test run on two routes .
&quot; if the offer comes , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will be available for many more remote routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train the ticket value without any creativity . &quot;
&quot; to use this , however some conditions have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and one must have booked an online ticket - what already do most passengers do .
&quot; you have to also buy it over the rail , the DB Navigator software , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket receipt . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one gets into the train , calling your ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test customer will then appear a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the traction companion get on their mobile devices a message that V@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y Y .
&quot; comes the train companion in the ticket card control at Square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ worth@@ less online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to work . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train , which is to take advantage of passengers . &quot;
&quot; who would like to go relaxed without a ticket check through our train accompanying , check in the DB Navigator simply yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB television . &quot;
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs .
&quot; who often drives rail , knows that besides un@@ obstruc@@ tions and pass@@ able trains , the ticket checks should be among the most nu@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , but one of the fellow travelers will not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either is missing the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document , which you must prove . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companion and chassis , which leads to bad mood in the section or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and take the creativity at the end the time takes care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only available at the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart meal .
further traction numbers on the same track are not yet released .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to their core .
&quot; just one day after they arrived in New York City , the one sitting in St. Louis , on the bed of an air@@ b@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the street , called it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , since no one otherwise posted the information on her Fe@@ ed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continuously saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white poli@@ c@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , M@@ on . , killed live . &quot;
he po@@ unded a picture of brow@@ n@@ out body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at itself . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone starting to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on people at the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the in@@ scription saying : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live Fe@@ ed with which a poli@@ cem@@ an stood before a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ishing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , uncovered another poli@@ cem@@ an his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded of their statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have used to us and which we can name typical .
at this moment I felt sc@@ rolling .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 pm , she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance force , which consists of the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter who carried a cau@@ dal dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on drove , the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; do you remember , how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she reminded of what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it &quot; , &quot; Fer@@ rell told later . &quot;
that which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
&quot; it must know , and it will see and be raised . &quot;
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I have the luck to give you an experience where they personally do not experience any e@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was built to a camp@@ ground as the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags in front and helped to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to take a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the Co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to only document &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came Fer@@ rell into the meaning : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot;
&quot; these skep@@ ticism was nourished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community who prof@@ ited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an explained recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism rum . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell &apos;s project , together with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in recent years after browsing . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to focus on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is the movement &quot; &quot; not about a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most evident participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ ells life , as she loves and mar@@ ry her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the ready product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability during this work and the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the broader black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice , that &quot; the movement is really kept alive by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it exists , however , that &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which the Fer@@ rell has been chosen as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the forefront because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which she calls for her home : &quot; &quot; a mess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they cl@@ oned on a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on to the streets three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; &quot; scale &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery &quot;
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although they are not yet built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been divi@@ ding the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold leaves the subject hardly any one .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Pop@@ fre@@ and Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic will be discussed .
&quot; while one can say to the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole sw@@ inging ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; do not need man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ s ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; W@@ hi@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents have built that a gallery pul@@ ls more customers into the city , of which also the rest of the business will benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian street . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the local market hall is , in which 13 direct market share their products . &quot;
with the start of construction work will be concluded .
&quot; the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely , to the Be@@ da square with possibility to sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Room : &quot; we have been shopping almost every week in the local market hall for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always very happy . &quot;
even the but@@ cher was discovered for us too .
we would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery a chance is to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; above all , the small @-@ market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether you are interested in a market hall in the gallery directly onto the height of the rent .
but this might not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; where@@ ar@@ omas of the Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dr@@ ones or supermarkets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
one can see how many shop@@ keepers are empty here - some have been standing for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that at least keep us the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is also reasonably priced . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , Lad@@ en@@ shops in a shopping centre can be found only by larger companies , as the dor@@ m rents are often not viable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special transactions are almost no more and what still remains , will probably even disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping centre with a Mark@@ thalle fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the farmers market place during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit @-@ gallery actually comes . &quot;
or does it bring the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit @-@ gallery to exp@@ el all the shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market there is no place for a peasant market - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
&quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ compar@@ ably identical - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from Wan@@ gen @-@ T@@ up@@ side and hair pieces created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the cuts out of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st was given a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they publicly declared as ge@@ heim diplomatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline un@@ iting their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and groundbreaking dis@@ member@@ ed , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted from the algorithms analysis of DNA , which could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these genom@@ ic data could look like how they can be interpreted and the har@@ ness determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing that was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been openly spoken about the identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , including 20 charges against the sp@@ y Act , computer was and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison its picture was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ary , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly uncomfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ el@@ blonde - with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has just returned from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in it the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette sle@@ eves and che@@ wing g@@ um , extraction the DNA out of waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her de@@ tained M@@ use were sent to un@@ equal letters , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of the Sho@@ ili Can@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Sup@@ pressed Images , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which the President Chel@@ ation verdict would change and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat low and star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump introduces a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ eter ways to fix the rigid spl@@ its that he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange timing was asked by all these things , she told that &quot; things happen to happen for a specific reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the Gallery written scrip@@ tural statement , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature , including the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is sex , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequences - a thou@@ sand@@ wich of Cs and Gs and As , in pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , how amazing similarly , at least in biological ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring to me is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell such a lot of different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in an own room , is a page from the above com@@ ic No@@ vel@@ le mentioned above . &quot;
she shows teams as they appear with a free @-@ free microphone in the hand of the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ barracks of the United States like king @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get geese , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was predicted in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ulations which collap@@ sed as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where its genetic h@@ ap@@ sack are written with pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea like the movement , which also hidden behind its liberation . &quot;
North@@ western and a cler@@ k at the University of Oxford for kill@@ ings
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest War@@ riors on the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau were exhibited , such as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority of Chicago published collaborative warning system , that the Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was declared dead on the place of events for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives study the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ dies has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ es , the Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be assessed in evaluated and exp@@ elled from the subject of the Campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair , which is studied by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates during this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ics . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators to any conceivable way . &quot;
&quot; the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens were shocked by colleagues , and want him to be . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he calls on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 was something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ dies and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic advantage . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the W@@ ada map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ Re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a specific stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada map is updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could give an concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list assumed that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the results obtained by the W@@ ada authorized investigation by the Canadian lawyer , Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren entitled dop@@ ing dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system had gotten an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; talking to the Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov was added to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has added to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; S@@ mir@@ nov was added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main artist of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Manager Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA explained in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

start @-@ ups which will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers do not do the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply no consistency and objectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has led people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it enables companies to address surveys , special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow the C @-@ Suite managers to handle and directly turn right to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the pursuit of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure employees . &quot;
she told me that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys by specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill up , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you must not be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ als since then a former employee has published a blog post who have spoken a blog post by those who have spoken , were punished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and see , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convertible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , enables Conver@@ cent company to send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real @-@ time and view the warmth of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline , with which staff can report the bad behaviour . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leaders are included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of public opinion has recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that its employees treated poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it may be costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employees @-@ fluctu@@ ation and pl@@ agues , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has been utilized for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intimid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company convertible supports , problems , which were previously placed by managers that were previously hidden in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or uns@@ afe practitioner - faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ level view of the experience with employment &quot; , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who heads the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment , li@@ tigation . &quot;
&quot; companies started to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their fil@@ thy laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and load the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that supports the approval of venture capital investors , which have supported both star@@ tu@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; convertible received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ern assured of $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , bringing its entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are barely surprising , given the connected nature of businesses , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are more expecting from their workplaces than before . &quot;
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bets .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work you are doing , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In that uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ der@@ ten when their portfolio companies are running well . companies are running well when employees work and are committed .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment according to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , it can have an anticipation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can breed and employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen how to rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow workers themselves , &quot; &quot; do you really hear me ? &quot;
take care of it ?
and who do not worry about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly collaborators , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so salvation . &quot;
&quot; by collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees it was possible to re@@ organise the decision @-@ making and quality of communication , able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always get new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in one industry which is known for high revolutions . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man &quot; , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you lose also customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customer , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood .
it is going to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ads are on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot pieces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer courses will return to their final examination , after the three @-@ hour exercise will return to their final examination , before starting the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday was closed . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and she actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training of U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 should start to meet the already packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the brood moved nearly a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six play @-@ times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are to hold out over the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal toys for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the rule @-@ change of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point to the multi@@ fac@@ eted routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they have simply crossed it out , they plac@@ es themselves further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really magnificent . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end up their practices as soon as the camp is completed , which in view of the clear view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been thrown with foot@@ b@@ fo@@ es , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task will be . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not so much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterf@@ eit registr@@ ations by third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to identify possible counterf@@ eit applications , and to send them to fac@@ t@@ lement , which may display results from the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main points points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News and many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
&quot; the issue has also become a major political issue in Europe whereby the French voters have been flooded with false stories in May with false stories , and Germany should not be punished for a plan , according to social media networks , if they do not succeed , h@@ asser@@ tive post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in English that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories of fac@@ t@@ apping third parties are challenged , people want more context to make sure decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Produc@@ man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to &quot; &quot; in conjunction with this article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news @-@ feed to reduce wrong news . &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a blind hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy seat at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says miserable . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; moved the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos;@@ Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpected . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 @-@ er years that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
&quot; and letters always smell to smoke , because at that time they had a fire on the light because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself were there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest &quot; ) , it seems all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
Rhodes spent his days spent his days spent the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; New &quot; Castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle like about the mon@@ te hy@@ ena heads at the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
&quot; he mig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscap@@ ing , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key , &quot; and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as Rhodes became a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ es it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards , those who possessed , &quot; &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought two families . &quot;
guys , let everything leave his course ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on bre@@ w basis into the English history , including &quot; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to close up the farm of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a turmoil that came into the castle 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Day of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farm began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jesu@@ it &apos;s Jesu@@ it &apos; family for seven years during the English re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ als presented from the 18th century to staged his own funeral by filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than its coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , always doing debts and spend money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men solve their debt crises by putting rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote vom@@ iting . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is searching for another unique write experience
&quot; he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ b@@ agu@@ as , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has been back since then by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
&quot; with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef launched her campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Lausitzer Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot;
yet until Thursday Lord Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to hold Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August there should be a highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ id@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; write them on their own website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that we as a bath comp@@ atri@@ cal citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in action it is about more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all@@ all@@ est promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique character . &quot;
&quot; after all , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; for a medium @-@ digit amount , the town of Bad Honnef can cost their new umbrella brand and the campaign . &quot;
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , he advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on retirement and demonstrations in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so this week also .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the minister@@ ial seat of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; during the presidency of the Heads of Government , the five vice @-@ deputy director , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Ex@@ ternal Action . &quot;
so the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the number .
the government moves the re@@ ins to the military .
&quot; General Staff General Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar will remain in office , but the com@@ man@@ ure of the He@@ eres , of the air forces and the n@@ avy were eliminated . &quot;
since the failed Cou@@ p President Erdo@@ gan in 16@@ 9 the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als rejected .
&quot; more than 10.000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire har@@ ming of the coup . &quot;
&quot; for 4@@ 86 people who should have been involved in the coup attempt immediately , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had given the upheav@@ al of the &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to complete the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan the army really in hand ?
&quot; at the end of February published the &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; published an article with the title &quot; Un@@ its in the Military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in general , there are concerns of an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which among other things are manifested in the abolition of the head@@ tu@@ ban for soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
the big cleaner in the army and the security forces goes on any rate .
&quot; in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan provided a decree of more 7@@ 3@@ 95 leaders , including 2@@ 30@@ 3 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan is t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly known as the actual lords of the country .
three times they put on calling on their role as a guardian of the world &apos;s state .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan forced the power of the military step by step , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted by the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; a particular not so @-@ called officers , who sought after the coup attempt by fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges have doubts about the deployment of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said Nato diplomats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , more stringent regulations for issuing vis@@ as for a refres@@ hed working permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that are coming to our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to san@@ e track for racing
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months , over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les have been denied - now it should go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , the route is to be built on which the tourist train leaves . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les over the long term , according to the transport of the Ministry of Finance nor this year work will begin on the track . &quot;
&quot; by making the decision to order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au race , the country has become important for the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; declared traffic secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the maintenance of the circuit , it amounted to about 2.5 million euros . &quot;
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , will now be finally tuned , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South @-@ Thur@@ in@@ gia as an operator can already agree on the technical details .
&quot; thus the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this makes the race sti@@ ff @-@ shuttle to be ordered by December 2017 .
the racing sti@@ ff shuttle is particularly popular among tourists popular rail connections between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ au@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation , the route was used by sufficient many people to order it again in the future . &quot;
the track is also very small in parts .
the rise of Sex @-@ Robot@@ ern is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it may not be any crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots comes . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big issue .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ sed professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make them funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key when the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ s have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions to be achieved by the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot through the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still more disturbing , as many robots possess the &quot; personalities &quot; that would look a step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ s have developed to robots with a sili@@ cone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot makes it possible for example to adjust its users , their robots to the properties that are appealing to them like for example . &quot;
and then there is still the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; who provides the impression of relap@@ se and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an adventurous personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the website of True companion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc . &quot;
during the day she also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ ages female properties , the swelling on rape , when one enters one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah goes , im@@ quiet one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True : Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; says it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ eder or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their origins and their increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will naturally keep no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R notices their rising popularity , they nevertheless remain in the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what can be perme@@ ated from the boundary zones , in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , are very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market gives permission to do so .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly evolved sex robots arise at a time in which the rights of women are threatened in the world , in which there is a president in the White House , who have ha@@ iled to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures that ent@@ win@@ ed body and the extinct eyes but how realistic this vision acts .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
&quot; the goal behind these sex robots consists of creating a physical resem@@ blan@@ ce to real women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) . &quot;
&quot; their heritage want them to feel humane , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
&quot; you do not have a mediation or a background history , nothing , which could distur@@ b on independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
expressed differently : they are counterf@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
umps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human body
&quot; it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ ty of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US voters , even families in the small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest , there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump elected relatives . &quot;
we are all supposed to take up all of us to put our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power Tr@@ umps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented conductor , who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family for a long time , I visited this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House every one she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she fought for decades , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to make the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this will also pose considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the app@@ end@@ ent effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ ur@@ ry way that one day does not show us any more . &quot;
&quot; there is however a long @-@ time @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appears in comparison with his standards suddenly as the term of denial . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the fall - the dog on Aut@@ od@@ ach , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - the two compared to Tr@@ ump in fact occur one as very mild crimes . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Republi@@ can only be mental to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my c@@ ousin in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the biggest of the Car@@ us@@ ell of the New York City Department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you do not need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ red and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climatic music convey@@ ed this on a notable way . &quot;
&quot; so many clubs of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not entirely across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the topics @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ years can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked them afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before making my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to aver@@ t the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping money - this in order to buy something over the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ usable while I get tired of experience , having my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us will be transferred to hospital with breast pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us has the second time to leave the prison for a hospital visit .
&quot; last year he was raised to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wr@@ ists , which he suffered from prison agencies according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to an appeal for pro@@ secut@@ ors for the first death sentence because of Mor@@ es after an appeal of the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he sle@@ w Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by playing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der , who hid in the c@@ ab . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , from which they say they may be too late . &quot;
&quot; the national law enforcement authority said that they will raise the objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard in this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold found a strange egg
&quot; as the last of Bul@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ acks were dischar@@ ged from F@@ TT and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen to the holidays and into the further schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students in the future proceed to a high school , four to the real school . &quot;
school guides an@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the home @-@ house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; as a symbol of school@@ ing , the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des , who is growing in the Ch@@ n@@ erhof , but then release in freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ t@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Ch@@ n@@ erhof . &quot; &quot;
&quot; peasant Arnold found a strange egg , and he caused it to broo@@ ds from his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken and a little eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , the eagle lifted up his wings on a high mountain of his wings . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the students of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken office . &quot;
&quot; h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder carried to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ agli@@ der Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other kit@@ es ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonging to it . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
wished for every quadru@@ pe@@ to that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; they followed Dan@@ kes@@ word to his colleagues , the former school@@ chief Michael Müller , who is always jumping again at teaching ho@@ ur@@ ry , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is now over , I explained class assistant Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students for two years of lessons only very odd , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the quad@@ rup@@ s@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all the students had a song of summer@@ time and holiday season . &quot;
and with the children a great pleasure broke out .
&quot; for the new school year , eight first records are already registered . &quot;
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned in Greece because of illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia , the police was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while there is currently an inquiry running . &quot;
the Department of Foreign Affairs was reported that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camps and place each one who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for that purpose , significant money funds . &quot;
controls will be continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can hang out a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what needs to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; there are BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the gas@@ eous rate of cars in the emission classes between 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE car Club Europe are estim@@ ations :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the binding updates previously apply only to vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their re@@ armament has arranged the multi @-@ drive office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months but not yet an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if anyway an inspection is required , this will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long should the re@@ armament be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the att@@ achments from the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntary act the car manufacturers on the subject of the environment so far not . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be it to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE reveals to the wait .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would be pulling out , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared this .
&quot; but in the regions , where driving har@@ es . &quot;
in rural areas there are so far no valu@@ ing losses for older diesel .
the ACE reveals to wait with a sale still .
ll C@@ ool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll C@@ ool J ( 49 ) is one of the cov@@ eted prizes of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; like the Kul@@ tu@@ re@@ direction on Thursday , this year also singers Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ o@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be handed over to the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the pri@@ eve prize winner of the Le@@ ar series , which , with progressive TV series , announced that it already announced to take part in the gala . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them the means - and that charged me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the interview with Tr@@ ump to clarify their view . &quot;

we do the city li@@ vable
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker , goes in R@@ ent in the coming year . &quot;
the place is already written - most suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker City bau@@ et@@ aker .
and the work is still great fun as he gives a talk to the press .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
at the same time mirac@@ ulous him that so far no application is fulfilling the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or engineer at the next time .
this is how to be - under consideration of the regular period of notice - still enough time for a review .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach is responsible for the administrative community as a sub@@ e construction law , the applicant has to pre@@ dict the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they cannot fill them out any more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg up to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; citizens &apos; proximity to the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere , as well as good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
in more than 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker .
&quot; we make the city life @-@ worth &quot; , &quot; he is confident about the country and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ park @-@ park are approximately met .
&quot; the cruci@@ fied bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
creative is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker of great scope .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction yard and gar@@ dener could be responded to quite flexi@@ bly .

&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; one eye for it , &quot; &quot; if new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the schei@@ d Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is Bau@@ tiful , &quot; in the end everything works here over my table . &quot;
&quot; for years of support and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing business for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ building ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to be identified and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company atmosphere , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , should in accordance with the City of Has@@ l@@ ach , should be submitted to a completed study as a diploma engineer or Bachelor &apos;s architecture in the fields of construction and building standards . &quot;

bike on wir@@ es : south @-@ train line closed
&quot; according to police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway leadership in the field of Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and look for night @-@ hours after them .
near the scene we have been witnessed a ros@@ ary Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bicycle driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ke , &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the A@@ PA . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator had brought himself to great danger and also jeop@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant as well as the delays and the costs of the rail traffic , we also have subscri@@ bing the train to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; in total , be out of a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage had been fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south line could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten persons have fallen on Friday morning , two of them see the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not turn out , but they were delayed . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres of over@@ lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; but a new study claimed the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes ga@@ stri@@ fe and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the person affected is usually advised to allevi@@ ate meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner Artenschutzüberein@@ top@@ han of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the food , do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to remove inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result from a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
experim@@ entation has been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found on mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a link between a bacter@@ i@@ art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one at Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet tolerant , less infl@@ amed intestinal cr@@ aters , when the same system is wir@@ h with people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that enhances the tolerance as she found out that a group of study tastes such cells had , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the wir@@ es of the mice were used DNA sequ@@ en@@ ades and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing on mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ ful environment so that they were missing a intestinal micro@@ bial and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria ign@@ ited on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were growing in a liquid , and then circul@@ ated small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
&quot; as an active component of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased about half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us can protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ adren@@ al products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i can develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relationship to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells inflammation over the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead to an extension of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius . &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , a &quot; genius , &quot; believe Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut of S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia had . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup starts on Tuesday and impres@@ sing in the Hal@@ ter &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira , after exposure . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ TIC was however excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia @-@ Tour of Blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was given that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later ready .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va &apos;s stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI to the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted to wish three more new obligations , but he insisted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four priority . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , but thanks to the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft @-@ maker Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
to be the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo has been painted in the sky .
new deep @-@ stop for Martin Schulz - Hannover - we have a problem
&quot; but as the wind turns : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel &apos;s SPD boss , saw the Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no stor@@ ks from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important desire of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz has led the party , it has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff from the Willy Brandt @-@ House has been watching the events in the SPD ruling state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind . &quot;
there were h@@ ubs .
and one after another .
&quot; after the end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Green . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably governed , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tions of a Greens dep@@ uties has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the election @-@ election the red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green CEO Michael wa@@ iter has prompted the ab@@ omin@@ ous Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Greens to El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to return their mandate .
the over@@ comes to the CD@@ U means a clear di@@ fication of the voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return to its mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal CEO and Elec@@ toral Council of the Greens to the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; that may not be true at all , &quot; &quot; sigh@@ s an SPD vote , as on Friday morning the new hi@@ ft message reached the Party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ President of Nieder@@ sachsen , is standing after the crossing of the Green parliament@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to CD@@ U with no own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ sions began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ ms down the comrades . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then also - and it was all considerably worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute the Party . &quot;
&quot; te@@ dious r@@ app@@ y , the comrades in the weeks later went up again . &quot;
&quot; then when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next stop .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member , lost his Nim@@ bus on this weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while burned his city . &quot;
&quot; and because he did so pretty much wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights his political survival . &quot;
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ car@@ bure@@ tor and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a longer time . &quot;
micro @-@ values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just so , Wei@@ l tried to put stronger in the past weeks more and stronger in the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained un@@ conce@@ aled by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they allowed him to grant him because they rejected a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l in the party &apos;s internal constraints is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz was not at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades try to close their own ranks . &quot;
&quot; their anger will focus on the green , and here above all on the ab@@ omin@@ ous parliament@@ arians &apos; v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Ms Cher@@ ry presents their own careers on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , chief of the Party @-@ left in the SPD &apos;s Bundestag , the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ life@@ jacket has not been elected as direct candidate , but has been elected to the parliament on the country list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Greens . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they res@@ igned their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD &apos;s Treaty , laments a &quot; &quot; democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische SPD to the Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career think of a future CD@@ U MEPs denoun@@ ced the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he urged the backgrounds to be un@@ resolved .
I want to know if there have been more or given the ple@@ dges of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for Or@@ ders III
those who want to join in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative of St@@ eg Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in received . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a look back to what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in sensitive san@@ itation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment of I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding fee . &quot;
&quot; at least 60 percent in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , subsidies were at least 60 per cent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous re@@ group@@ ings are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only to tap into new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information given by the Government of Karlsruhe on April 4 , that there will be a san@@ itation area . &quot;
&quot; the funding sum total 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which accounts for 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community received . &quot;
how is a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; you will continue to study so sh@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; real old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role whether in the planned area to be in interest to san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory borders could then move again . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ty occurred on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; in which the san@@ itation would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of internal cities , improving the living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be subject to object @-@ related , that is done per property . &quot;
the rehabilitation area then would eventually be defined as stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , the inventory of events would not be carried out once , within the framework of which we can fill out a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , I shall proceed as the pro@@ posi@@ tional process to begin with the sanctions in the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every Commune had to be carried out by the predic@@ ate pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; it is the reason to evaluate and decide the urban abnorm@@ alities , and decide when it is sandy , and to what extent . &quot;
for the particular property there will be also a san@@ itation in the base book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after you , and get a picture of the situation she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and plot rainbow &quot; , &quot; in which among other things , it is about the construc@@ tional state and san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary and housing &quot; , &quot; can be made details of size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; Firmware &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , in mind , Got@@ zel pointed out that a negotiated questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not con@@ ve@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ ist principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , you will be sure first . &quot;
&quot; you cannot reserve funding for &quot; &quot; later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; Or@@ ders II &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors also sets up a micro@@ chip to come up with a movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a towel . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ pl@@ ated the tiny chip between thum@@ b and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory team in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure that the implant process is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a supplement of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father from one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the promotional costs of the White House cost tax@@ payers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy helicopter to fly to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing last month , tax@@ payers have left to leave the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was produced in Connecticut , beside a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn in accordance with the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of this because it &apos;s an unusual event with high visibility , wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the deputy Mar@@ ine@@ kom@@ commander for aer@@ ospace . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn in the morning at 7 p.m. on the occasion of the South La@@ wn in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening was cleared . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the flight should be delayed from the White House , due to the restriction of the hours a second team would require a flight back . &quot;
&quot; the original air@@ strikes was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the period . &quot;
&quot; out of the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act provides federal states to use public ownership for political purposes .
datas@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event might inj@@ ure the determination .
&quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a impetus for the reform of the health reform , which was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ tainment the government &apos;s regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is of politically beneficial purposes and is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; in February Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation into the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages related to the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws are often leading training trips in the Washington area around Washington and in South La@@ wn , in order to set the US President in the White House with precise centimeters . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led at the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event with the training requirement for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ payers have not presented the burden for any of the other prec@@ is@@ ations , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company had not been involved with the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget labels for the Presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D result for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
record of unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far under this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ payers are based on estimates of the provision of equipment is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 the revenues for DO@@ D does not contain the personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ an , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate , to be emphas@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of fire fighters . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to the representative of Si@@ kor@@ sky and cher@@ ished with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky task
top @-@ ranking of the second tennis Bundesliga occurs in the table in the third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will be on tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the table of the third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite his five games still un@@ flaw@@ less balance sheet , the leader of the second tennis Bundesliga has received the sense of the reality . &quot;
team propriet@@ or Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has no respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
straight on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V especially the imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their insulation and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets on the Davis Cup . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give max@@ im four .
&quot; at the moment the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not manage the Bundesliga game , the tournament in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will come to his first use in this season . &quot;
the Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo yesterday was with the White P@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky yesterday with the AT@@ P @-@ tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; it should be in Kiel but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ri@@ p , N@@ iels Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;

role back@@ wards : the town provides 46 kitchen subsidies
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ noon table itself .
with firm contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban nur@@ series the clock is turned back .
&quot; on September 1 , the City of Kre@@ feld is taking over the food provision in the urban children &apos;s facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in O@@ reg@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director at the Department of Youth Aid , this is a good message : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooked will continue to be out of house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh @-@ cooked , cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the creative fields of 46 kinder@@ garten sites , in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year &apos;s year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; by now , not only children who are taken care of 45 vo@@ irs , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 sub @-@ professionals have from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the Anglo @-@ wide dishes , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the meal individually , give away the food , rooms , rin@@ se , and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ca@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups of group @-@ group facilities - decided on the fold .
&quot; the kitchen staff are now part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved and it is simpler for the genital war@@ time , more ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because this is why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help the food prepare .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is as reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen forces - is carried out in the future by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , it also has the charm that it has turned out in the cost @-@ effective between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign loan for the city as the most economical means it is from the press office . &quot;
and that even though 46 sub @-@ time forces will be re@@ arranged .
&quot; but these hours fall by around 750 people in the education area not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women .
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ om , acting Head of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are going to thri@@ ve in the provinces of the provinces . three women are edge @-@ president for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credible when women are fully involved and included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 .
the Taliban have published threats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international batt@@ lements to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be held peace@@ fully from a democratically elected government to the next one . &quot;
Hay@@ om said a strong role for women will continue to strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reports that 1,2 million women are registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot;

GM@@ B concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to sc@@ rub themselves at the managers of the bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in the Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company has to weigh about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which is beside other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ kings owners Pla@@ dis said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and union officials would experience &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; , &quot; if their activities change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; &quot; concerns about the financing for the modernisation of production lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus on the local community and the large space of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person on Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p at T@@ oll@@ cross did not receive a letter from GM@@ B Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this , as we estimate the continuous engagement with employees and trade union officials . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , in which some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we operate like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate , our business constantly checked - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a producer of production . we should change our operations in the location , the employees and their union officials will be the first to learn this . &quot;
has the P@@ SG Barcelona warned three years prior to Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not dimin@@ ish in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after they release a fee of £ 18@@ 9 million , but they have warned Barcelona three years before the world crash ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has gr@@ aced the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after the end , Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become the most expensive player in the world and for the most paid professional sports@@ men of the world . P@@ SG offers wages of more than 500,000 GB@@ P per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way out there , although a source located near the Catal@@ ans pre@@ diction that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but three years ago the football world was warned of the P@@ SG @-@ president in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of P@@ SG . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line with the Spanish Association at the beginning of this summer interest in the P@@ SG @-@ Mittel@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
&quot; P@@ SG made clear that they wouldn &apos;t allow the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;
sco@@ oters cast and damaged
&quot; during the night of Friday on Saturday there has been a well @-@ known perpetr@@ ator one in the Royal fields street in front of the estate number 30 &quot; &quot; sco@@ oter &quot; &quot; and thus directed at the cl@@ adding of the vehicle rather than 200 Euros . &quot;

&quot; because he got a car on his driving track , the driver had to so@@ ften the driver of a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ ched the lad@@ ders . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au coming in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the upheav@@ al of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came out on his driving track so that he had to turn right after the right . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report de@@ contamination Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the rain@@ s@@ burgs Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report to the abnorm@@ alities of the pop@@ e pop@@ e Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report to the dis@@ appearing sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ er , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church &quot; , &quot; explained by the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the Benedi@@ ct XVI I. &quot;
&quot; it would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have expressed deep regret on their own om@@ issions , or at that time , false evaluation of the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen will be measured with &quot; two levels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt no one doubt that it would have to be prevented &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; , &quot; but the &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; &quot; historians and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the all @-@ day experience and is preparing the public opinion that is normal for normal &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; one would like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co@@ es .
&quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply current standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
in connection with the reports on the abnorm@@ alities often emerged also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who dealt with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder band &quot; My Br@@ other of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take in protection in Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with educ@@ ating attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were made in between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; victims of assault , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , the report says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment of the students could also be intense . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other def@@ endants in contrast to numerous other def@@ endants , many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases they even connect positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann , why the final report about dis@@ ruption to the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; &quot; incidents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence in Prot@@ ective &quot; &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a one , many students lift his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist , which was tangible , when a domain name musi@@ cally won &apos;t be a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as a bio@@ grapher ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when one makes the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather why the name George R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all in it . &quot;
he is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspicion of the abet@@ tor or co @-@ knowing of the terrible instances of sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school event@@ ful outside its impact . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to take it at the moment , to find out of it too late , or take the first hint not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school , in which he worked , was perceived by practically all those - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincerely &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; and always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfection and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to whale @-@ broo@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; that he didn &apos;t only cast out with chairs and cast the key@@ word on the ground , but also ear @-@ pe@@ ars were divided and too fre@@ che guys in the hair or ears , he has been deeply regre@@ ts for years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honorary ret@@ ali@@ ce must be said that such educ@@ ating methods in the questionable time , the 1960s and seven@@ ties , were widespread , in parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us , who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced that in a secular school , a state @-@ g@@ ymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , are the dre@@ d@@ ging of dre@@ d@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; if one wonders if it is not more likely to do with its familiarity and role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , many media has just gone on him . &quot;
&quot; on Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him to be still eager . &quot;
the truth is : the report de@@ contamination Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also being put into account or co @-@ knowing in regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : quite clearly no .
&quot; no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault , claims to become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister . &quot;
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; a du@@ ped deputy for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing for me . &quot;
the true issue in education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are not silent .
&quot; if they trusted not even parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abnorm@@ alities ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a de@@ frag@@ mented pup@@ il : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... any case in which he would have had timely findings and could have stopped the relevant perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , accepting that there &apos;s more urgent and more clear or more opened than against their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leaders , confidence teachers etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that in advance the student and / or their environment entrusted him , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; so , what sexual abuse concerns , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to share with each co @-@ knowing . &quot;
&quot; thus , he cannot be accused of dis@@ car@@ ded him or have brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , there was a lot of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown away in the report .
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; but that is , in turn , is a misuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , it is clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the g@@ ymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other allegations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir leaders . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which l@@ ad of sa@@ w@@ ns teachers are rec@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ited and mal@@ ign@@ ited , occurred all at the pre @-@ school in Eth@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states must have existed . &quot;
&quot; but with whom the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the young only to face when they were already on the domain of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , like most witnesses emphas@@ ise the topic &quot; &quot; Pre @-@ School &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
&quot; one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; states . &quot;
what was different from the domain ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was already discipline , but just no sa@@ wing of violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; many victims estimates the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , they even connect positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , at the most left of the accus@@ ation , we have seen . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish themselves and from the events at a school , at which he had not worked and responsible , ( such a witness ) was nothing to hear , and then again at 1993 . &quot;
only Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently fails the ears ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ inger director , which was even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out this to that , that in the pre @-@ school he will continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity was , as the audi@@ tors were also banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before this , they have occurred in a legal grey area , as everyone of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; there was hard to estimate for him , where the sufferers may perhaps exaggerated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permitted limit was crossed . &quot;
&quot; but one cannot say , but he had always looked at . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the testing of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis , yes , it was unfair to apply the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the then time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we historian talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , coming to today &apos;s moral principles . &quot;
the princess has already quite right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse that was vile at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against inno@@ cent children , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
&quot; this is all quite aw@@ ful , and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take protection to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ ths and to pull in the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment then , it has also been strictly held to it . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his Regen@@ sburger &apos;s time has returned to you in discussions with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the topic testing also about the language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI of his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ ade played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I didn &apos;t believe that he led a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but that must also be said : without these perfection , without saying un@@ related discipline , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ ts , the true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not even make a big singer and stand before every success , right in which territory , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
&quot; as what a human being , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really quite well and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep unbelie@@ ving and sav@@ ory people from which one could not imagine that he could not do anything of a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get along with how many former dom@@ es still exists today , 23 years after its em@@ eri@@ ation , regularly contact him , to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , was therefore strictly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , this may be - but also a lovely respect person , to which they still look up today and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you advance , are tut@@ orials , which were at that time on the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long overcome these times .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is a prominent and has an even more prominent brother , to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent , that is behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been released , dischar@@ ged him . &quot;
&quot; now , the an@@ ig@@ saw areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year old man who has acquired great service and without which outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally in peace . &quot;
