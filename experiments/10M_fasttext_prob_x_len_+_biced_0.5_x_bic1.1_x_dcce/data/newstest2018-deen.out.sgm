<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards to change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren Anstalt is to meet young people today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftelle where is now excavated for the S-Bahn Tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardenser manage the rusty ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münch encourages exciting stories to day.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's nervous when landcards are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this knows everyone who had to be exciting at this time, because the car Navi took place in a green meadow instead of a crossing road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the geoportals of Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but it is very conclusive."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it becomes clear, as cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickwerk, which one does not recognise as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the big coverage map were shown for cities and villages for detailed maps, so-called urine sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These arose according to the Bayerischer Versuring administration between 1810 and 1864 and skipping the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your clients: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leaders occupied Bavaria since the Spring of 1800 during the Second World War Crimean war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic record in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops went out with the peace of Lunéville, from 9 February 1801: they were the contemporary neighbors, which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the" topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische Verveying government."</seg>
<seg id="19">The pripositional leaf for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all the other to find on the website of the Bavarian National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map of the map, so 1877, as a Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today subverdling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses shelter around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named only 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the western park, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in the Hindenburg, a smallish map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbering out of the so-called" "Urge", "from which the basic tax was derived from the so-called" "Urge". ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"small parcels today occupy no farmers more - but small gardeners of the plant" "country in Sun." "</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is characterised by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese since 1810 on the October of the October Revolution, was in the 19th century in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the genealogy page one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, not only the street name" "on Gasteig" "or by the" "On the ventilation" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt "." "</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfielstraße we once saved people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There in 1858 / 59 was the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt on the Auer Lüften. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought to King Ludwig's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig's II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the strings of so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he is also forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen, who has employed himself for an exhibition with the prison. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had been first place, later it was expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity does not have enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisircle in hair of 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there has been the Isar-Ampikum Munich-East since 2006, one of Germany's largest psychiatry."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth-home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the Children's House" Casa Don Bosco "- in architecturally view on the country of origin of the Irrenanstalt, was destroyed during the Second World War in bombardment."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in 1856 as" main square "," the purchase street was called "Kaufinger alley." "</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 are many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business buildings and a Gruftchapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where this day was the pre-working day, and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony took place for the second S-Bahn platform."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich card can be compared to the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national union to promote color has issued a warning for colored people based on discriminatory policy and racist attacks by the State of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Missouri, which should come into force up to 28 August 2017, while travelling through the state demands special attention and be expressed with extreme caution, since a number of fragmented, enforceful incidents in recent times occur in the entire state and here is noted," says it in the opinion of the Group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to attract Discriminality, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionate to minorities, the group, the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have wounds of civil rights, men pass."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are kept together because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency, which we have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the quoted incidents like racist Vergo against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no gasoline by the state and taken by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report of the office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri, in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will be more common in the state 75 per cent more frequently than White."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring interest money or to know the relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate speech in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate-breaking report of the FBI, which lays the state regarding the number of such violations in the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law, which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Society (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration law enforcement, which will contribute to local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to further margins."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel openings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Pasture project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Faibach Weidefence-Project is a success project and continues in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group by Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have gained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the Sanctuary of the Schwendemann, representatives of the fishing bacher CDU-town met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann continued to gain insights into its operation, in which he generates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows kisses and as well as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feriengaeste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "is for him the ageing marketable path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste exclusively regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of Fisherbach, he described the Weidecelerate project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not be profitable on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for a lot of work, much has to be dealt with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the eleventh operation, and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he has no bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "the Commune recognised the importance of the undeceit project, and is happy with the leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the reforestation of the land could be pulled out quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," "stressed the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure space is about 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter carried the church fishing."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, they love the farmer 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weidefence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," stated Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac continued:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and land women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss stood firm:" "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscure-Care (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the government promotion of pasture care.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR-signed conveyor belts.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the uncovering area must not be inconceivable (Hangaversion over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman Weidecelerate project, the application of eight participants currently runs with 24 plots, which would like to have almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the lower cost is more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is it if they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump-regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic Axt in a hitch dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of Presidents for the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller attacked not the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty ators would have denied him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their importance, and in particular the importance that you have been attributed as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the memorial, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta:" I don't want to go here to a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom to enlighten the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but as he formed himself it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance to the emerging words of Lazarus, the only one where a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your needy, your poor, / Your beards masses, who are longing for free to breathe free, to the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus and their friends, who set themselves to place their words after their death on the basis - did very well that they have accomplished a highly political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a unused classical representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminine coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly like Lazarus, the meaning of the statue changed, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of John Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not a call, but rather an early Neoconservative that the American flame is moving into the world:" lady Liberty goes ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh met here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and at all a matter of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative fact of Lazarus consisted in it to see them as they were seen by the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the true sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome, which they have to hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump have ever to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black Storks Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two piers belonged to the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Director of the Leichtathletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16 member of the world will perform a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that will start on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" in Scotland "" something special "" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it. "</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to continue until we find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is; it is absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eiliie Doyle was elected to the team member team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where they were living or exercising, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eiliie brought quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver Medal, who will compete in her fifth world Championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 sheers are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="146">The midrange of Muir is on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5.000 m of the runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another shepherd, which one should be observed after a great season, which included the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannitner's capitals says that they are" hugely proud "to the fact that many of their countrymen not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about to be team-capitals that was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chosen to make it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all those who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise on Podia."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Facebook: Beast yourself not to be a public office if you do not tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers smote him because of all, from domestic policy to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shaved in the review, safely."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we will be led like sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan who needs to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and erased their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Society complained him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the statab of the governor left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-ranking approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with its voters and to debate his hair-loose head after chemotherapy on its side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that will be officially designated as officially and by co-workers who are paid with public tax-Dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the governor and argued that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasserted people, who vibrate the whip online."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are just real people who speak with their chosen guides: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a parish, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told that their comments are respectful and thoughtful and not professors.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor showed the Bible in his post and appealed Hogan's faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lacshmi Lakma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassertive but she asked for hate-hate."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and gave other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the message "" The Post. "" "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, they are used by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employee of the governor as" concentrated "spam attack," would others probably be "interrogation". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critics or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one could have done the same that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical corals, to burn or to burning demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is precisely what happened just digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to the U.S.S. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they named a voter by their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the moment, Washington had a similar impact on the Internet at affordable Portos."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous envelope to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had an anonymous Troll.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington's decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and the shipping sector with the UK, expressed his office, according to historical documents submitted by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have them silenced.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are part of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former Europeans No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope in the next three days in local comfort, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who lost last year in the Archerfield left until the Endrunde, before he lost against Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue, and acts as a tournament leader in the name of the club-founder and the CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," said Rafferty. "</seg>
<seg id="210">"players will see this course from his best, he is in a great condition."</seg>
<seg id="211">Jerry made a great job when he laid this place.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is a eagerly fiery of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">"the English Eales is looking forward to having a championship for the first time, even though he won the European Challenge tour in his 32-year career."</seg>
<seg id="215">"that feels really special," "said the player in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">"I cannot defend the Extremadura Open as it was in the year after I won them out of the program."</seg>
<seg id="217">Back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon, last year here."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.</seg>

<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you play at home," "Orr, the man of Helensburgh."</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf game.</seg>
<seg id="226">"I am glad, as far as it has gone."</seg>
<seg id="227">"with the trio on the field the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNom."</seg>

<seg id="867">"Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experience in preparation with the three-dimensional chain, than with the four-dimensional chain."</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we just have in the triple-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießmann players who can build well", "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"it is the prerequisite, however, that we do even better harmonise and we do not do so much error in building."</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can virtually begin the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that players from Aue might even be a little fresher, since they had no heavier and complete game such as Fortuna against a Ascension favite. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know so 100% where they are currently standing," says the Interior Defense of the Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"while guests from the Rheinland leave the Rheinland as an easy favourite on Sunday, at last (almost) the stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we swept away, just because we have the claim to come under the first six, is Blödalism," says Funkel, whose record in only one defeat against Aue from nine games is quite positive. "</seg>

<seg id="886">"they should make the assessment of the age more precisely during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish migration authority (migrant resellers) was criticized because of errors in assessing the correct ages of some refugees."</seg>
<seg id="887">"until today, the Migrations has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person 'may be 18 years or older.</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion that the person may be aged under 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan idransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistently resistant in recent months."</seg>

<seg id="1317">The great life living: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court flat in a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a great house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my prize.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I showed this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with her and made an offer on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square feet large apartment was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a one bedroom property with a closed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add yoanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms at one another, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking to solve the record.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel construction is rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so we were overed, without having to drop us."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to attach the steel so that he had the right height for the function or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed it Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold-furniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirrors feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units for all cutlers and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"by perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering started inside," explains Erfan of the stahlreinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so it is when you slide the door very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could win extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base surface - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will occur, and a calculation based on the size size will perform."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they managed to enlarge the floor space, while using high quality materials, which gives the room its luxury advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if yes, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new staff member of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on an equitable course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new leader of the White House, met with leading employees, he set up a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to count trump by monitoring its media coverage. "</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television last decades back - and now, where it is in the White House, his television is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate was angry because of a unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were persuaded," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February against Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets would have even more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff made it a couple of times, to hold trouble from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"however, no one has consistently been able to prevent trump controversies."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that the people in a white house consists of competing parties, repeatedly try to move their own agenda by using trump material that may promote their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to inform the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press pages, especially such with shameful leaks and to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that happened at the end of February, when someone accused the President of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocation Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy rod in Katie Walsh," the source behind a pile to be of Lecks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was banished permanently from Twitter because of Schikanen, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he voiced false accusations in the past."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then rod Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadts Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>

<seg id="1480">"in Russia's affair, by US President Donald Trump, Special Representative Robert Mueller is to have used a so-called Grand Jury for a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in the past few weeks, the panel received work in the last few weeks, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "among the calling for trusted persons."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper analyses the step as a sign that mueller expanded and intensified its investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the transmitter CNN reported, there were already the first preladle of the Gremium related to a meeting between Trumps and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">"US intelligence services accuse the Kremlin since longer, targeted in the presidential election in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigates whether there were evenings between the mumps of the campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of investigations, several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the republicist."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to report, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment under the magnifier."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special erers Trump was personally involved in the centre and seek the accusation, whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jurys is to examine and decide the evidence in possible dispute cases, and decide whether it should be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called accusing.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when it deals with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be switched on by the prosecutor's office to pre-charge people for use under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the channel CNN, pre-Ladin were already issued to rotate the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">Individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to be asked to give a statement on the report called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. were also trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his dam campaign Paul Manafort on the interview.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"experts said on Thursday evening on Thursday, that the installation show that Mueller will not be intimidated in his work and that he should be necessary to act fast."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the acquisition of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present Russia's affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia-story is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion, he does not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this work also usually in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocate any actions that accelerated the work of the special supplier in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI leader James Comey have told three times that not to be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"you have no reason to accept that something has changed, it was in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">"however, Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired."</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this cast, allegations against Trump have become loud, he would like to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"he said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump made him an attitude of investigations against the former national security advisors Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1514">"the extinguished speculations about it, whether Trump Mueller was released."</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent manufacturer of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair, around the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position where he could be fired at the Durging of the President of the Minister of Justice."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers large piston is now up north and will probably take two, three years until he melted."</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, is unclear according to researchers."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there has been a series of unusual interbreakthroughs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be combined with heating."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colossus had so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus grows further into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this swear was the balance of waxes and abortion a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete shelee is to be broken there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to do so that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the presenters have never withdrawn as far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate is under tension and could fall down, if at a key point a piece disburoms."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelsweis and iceberg not raises the level of sea, as it is floating on the water and pushes ice so much water as it results after the melt itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the swear leads to the fact that the glaciers are able to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the level of sea, but only in the slight dimensions, writes the British research project for watching the Antarctica (MIDAS)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is after AWI-Information with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the four-largest sweelfeis of the Antarctic.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"on the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change, the kingsign comes into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the widest withdrawal from the beginning of records, he also confirmed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"under scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfei will now grow back or put together in the long run, and possibly summarize, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if this researchers did not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg not to climate change, so in recent decades many of the ice-glaring of the Antarctic."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce meet normally in to examine their plans for reporting on recent chaos in the state of Zinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists will discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with granates, or let them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words to a table on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporter to propose name for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abs."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspects on the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of violence, and while in the whole country the bodies corpses are amassed: at least 25, President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 gave his office. 589 are on attacks and threats under Bundesschutz and until now there was at least seven dead in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, their editor and the inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep even though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows its mediator with the word" Justice "," hanging at the façade of Riodoce building. two reporters in the three-thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which seem to be smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmare, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010, a probe of journalists was established in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of killings that are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely put in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intreast and even though the terrain is now even more disguised."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety requires little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know that, mistrust we all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive it just a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - who was translated with" Tweld river "." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius ran away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be freely around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinhala has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rivaling factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinhala every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of promised, two-story Mauss for drug registers, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"remember for a minute that there is a state of 'peace', if only a box control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States has."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartons in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangsters bought every copy of the output, as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez in it, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country at its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killings will be seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as an experienced porter for Noroeste when he joined with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without bump into the smoking problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and revenues and publicity."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters, they loved to publish hard punching examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious' Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America. "</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task of playing as a journalist, either that or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in view of so many things... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"Riodoce team merged Valdez, the spa-bird, who was like a harbour-bird, the friend who knew generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted us on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Cabo, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there on the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, they wonder: was his love for routine his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also forced them to ask her own assumptions on how they do work best, and they can stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their homework and cross-railways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, do not apply in Zinaloa, as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before has been known that Spyware was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside we searched two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who referred to the governor themselves as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago since the reporter have gone to the mountain landscape, where drugs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has grown to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the State expenditures and focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the Prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local drug and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporters from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which ruled almost the whole century of all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several Pri governors have been accused of criminal offences for high-quality cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal bat the reporters to write about previous incidents in this Local, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went to a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body statur. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to storage space for signs and stickers who protest against the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Repormate Miriam Ramirez snap a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"in the western state of Michoacan, the western state of Michoacan were killed in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country journalists have become vocal in organized protests in the" SOS Press "" on salaries and buildings. "</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinhala, a day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities, reportedly elect and bring them, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has been asked for the fact that she is redivided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico of organised crime, involved in government officials and a united society." "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism" "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug companies, but also on the command of politicians and security forces working with the organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, Articulo 19 has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you think, because they want you to hold the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias, at the northern border of Tamauellipas six years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas de Kartell:" "I am here because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer tastatur and earphones stood next to their separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have voted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte at the northern border of Chihuahua for the assassination of the correspondents Miroslav Breach, in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as it did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly set up the drug press with an editorial on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and are looking for danger."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered by four women in an apartment in Mexico-City three months after the escape of Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain back and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, gives up that the drug store him scared him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to Hell, and that is why I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"by midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank of beer, than once all of their phones began."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting with band reefs and security guards near the beach Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continues to escalate as it was promised by a number of cartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the on-board edge they released the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heels near to - a further shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who held the guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid of all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose centerfinger was visible for all Sinhala, the employees of Riodoce followed its mark."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just keep thinking about it," said Bojorquez, "when the same day was murdered by Javier, the trainee asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to soften its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying. "</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinoceros of a Canadian miners were so well preserved that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs. "</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his skinned skin was of reddish Braun - and they said, she could have had something of a" "restful past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "referred to it as" the possessed-made dinosaurs, which was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"fossil is a newly discovered kind of Nodosaurs, who lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably good preservative condition has researchers, who describe it as' really remarkable ', startled"</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil fuel of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks at the Platze, and decided to see more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">This was discovered by him Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animals within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy ground."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the ready result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are only a little with the eyes blinking, you might almost believe that it slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation is visible."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is going to be in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa, the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this plant eater is covered, although it is covered with armaments and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from carnivores, and used parachute technology, which is used as a counterbalance, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to deviate its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurs family made the headlines in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Borealopelta markchelli named after the Museumsteer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astounding preservation of the specimen made available to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armors to document his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-attires, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature is darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-coloring is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta by far the animals living today is overflowing."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points out that the dinosaurs has enough pressure from meat eating eating dinosaurs, that evolution was favored by wearing the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use counter-attires - think of deer, zebras, or girdles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predators behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been" said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaur red was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life, including its Consermon Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, went out into a river and turned into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with consered skin, but also in three dimensions remains intact and the original form of the beast retains", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost as much as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is on sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaur, which stood on two legs, passed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the armored dinosaurs became hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons heavier monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology seem to believe that Borealopelta has been vershadowed by the sea in the sea and in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the besteress dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tops that raked by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant eaters have been scratched by Western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater order of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still bumpy corted plates along the dinosaur cover</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confuse it."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified reste of the skin still cover the bumpy cords that carry the skull of the beast.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front-foot is on his side, his five fingers is pointed upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: Group tested "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1990">Does the creator come and arouses an unsushing or irritates the gast in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Postcard control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are passed soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The German railways currently testes the creation-free ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">Just confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken its place and devalues with it the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently there is a test run on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer comes, we expand it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will be available for many more remote routes in Germany in the beginning of next year," "said a train speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort check-in" "calls the train the ticket value without any creativity."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"to use this, however some conditions have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And one must have booked an online ticket - what already do most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you have to also buy it over the rail, the DB Navigator software, which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket receipt."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "Comfort Check-in" "works so: one gets into the train, calling your ticket under" My Tickets "." "</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customer will then appear a button for the electronic devaluation.</seg>

<seg id="2006">"comes the train companion in the ticket card control at Square Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already unworthless online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue to work."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train, which is to take advantage of passengers. "</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who would like to go relaxed without a ticket check through our train accompanying, check in the DB Navigator simply yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Management Board of DB television. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often drives rail, knows that besides unobstructions and passable trains, the ticket checks should be among the most nuances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"because often you have, in any case, but one of the fellow travelers will not have all the documents required for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either is missing the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document, which you must prove."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train companion and chassis, which leads to bad mood in the section or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and take the creativity at the end the time takes care of other concerns."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after they arrived in New York City, the one sitting in St. Louis, on the bed of an airbb apartment, which she rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the street, called it there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since no one otherwise posted the information on her Feed, she completed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was continuously saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mon., killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He pounded a picture of brownout body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," "thought Ferrell at itself."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone starting to return later in the evening to Tweets on people at the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription saying:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live Feed with which a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a bellishing dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, uncovered another policeman his rifle and cried:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell reminded of their statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have used to us and which we can name typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt scrolling.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 pm, she fetched her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson in the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and resistance force, which consists of the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter who carried a caudal dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson drove, the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" over the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"do you remember, how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she reminded of what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are going to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it", "Ferrell told later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it must know, and it will see and be raised."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organization but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I have the luck to give you an experience where they personally do not experience any eatant racism, it is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would give her a bad service to keep them away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was built to a campground as the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags in front and helped to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to take a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after 9 August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the Co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only document" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came Ferrell into the meaning:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community who profited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan explained recently in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism rum."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to Ferrell's project, together with six other natives followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in recent years after browsing."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is the movement" "not about a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan - she proved to be the most evident participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of ferells life, as she loves and marry her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the ready product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability during this work and the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of the black gay women in the broader black-lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media after the killing of the black teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice, that" the movement is really kept alive by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it exists, however, that" "this is not a affirmative type of action," in which the Ferrell has been chosen as the heart of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which she calls for her home:" "a mess." ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, they cloned on a song and she feels committed to this memory, since she went into Ferguson to the streets three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">"from" dream "to" "scale" ": TV-reader discuss about bit-gallery"</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, although they are not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south-end of the pedestrian precinct has been dividing the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Popfreand Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while one can say to the bit-gallery:" this would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real "" (Nicole swinging), comes from the other side: "" do not need man "" (Siggi Bets) or quite simply: "" Whiahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents have built that a gallery pulls more customers into the city, of which also the rest of the business will benefit, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian street."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the local market hall is, in which 13 direct market share their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely, to the Beda square with possibility to sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping almost every week in the local market hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Even the butcher was discovered for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery a chance is to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"above all, the small-market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether you are interested in a market hall in the gallery directly onto the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But this might not be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "wherearomas of the Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drones or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shopkeepers are empty here - some have been standing for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that at least keep us the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is also reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, Ladenshops in a shopping centre can be found only by larger companies, as the dorm rents are often not viable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special transactions are almost no more and what still remains, will probably even disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a Markthalle fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where is the farmers market place during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old EDEKA would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit-gallery actually comes."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it bring the Gespenst bit-gallery to expel all the shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market there is no place for a peasant market - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more place.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost incomparably identical - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupside and hair pieces created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the cuts out of Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst was given a 35-year prison sentence after they publicly declared as geheim diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline uniting their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking dismembered, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted from the algorithms analysis of DNA, which could be extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like how they can be interpreted and the harness determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning that was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been openly spoken about the identification as a woman since their puberty, including 20 charges against the spy Act, computer was and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison its picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granary, black-white selfie, in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable on a driver's seat and carries a platelblonde - with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg has just returned from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in it the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette sleeves and chewing gum, extraction the DNA out of waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her detained Muse were sent to unequal letters, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of the Shoili Canungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "which would foresee a future in which the President Chelation verdict would change and she would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat low and starkes, since Donald Trump introduces a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender-troops to find new, tweeter ways to fix the rigid splits that he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing was asked by all these things, she told that" things happen to happen for a specific reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the Gallery written scriptural statement, Manning with her oversized signature, including the" "i" "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, whose basis is sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequences - a thousandwich of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), how amazing similarly, at least in biological ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring to me is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell such a lot of different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in an own room, is a page from the above comic Novelle mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows teams as they appear with a free-free microphone in the hand of the disciplinarbarracks of the United States like king-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist, who greeted me from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was predicted in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulations which collapsed as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, as everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where its genetic hapsack are written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed with Chelsea like the movement, which also hidden behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it may not be any crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots comes."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big issue.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritised professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make them funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "said Mr. Sharkey when the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpus have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions to be achieved by the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs," and select everything from the eye-color of the robot through the form of nipples to the type or color of its fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still more disturbing, as many robots possess the" personalities "that would look a stepford woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpus have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot makes it possible for example to adjust its users, their robots to the properties that are appealing to them like for example."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah" who provides the impression of relapse and "Wild Wendy" with an adventurous personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the website of True companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or it can be" in mood. ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underages female properties, the swelling on rape, when one enters one step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah goes, imquiet one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True: Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" says it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a feeder or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origins and their increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will naturally keep no sex robot, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they nevertheless remain in the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what can be permeated from the boundary zones, in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, are very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlapping that these highly evolved sex robots arise at a time in which the rights of women are threatened in the world, in which there is a president in the White House, who have hailed to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical pictures that entwined body and the extinct eyes but how realistic this vision acts.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the goal behind these sex robots consists of creating a physical resemblance to real women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions)."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their heritage want them to feel humane, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" personalities, "the robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House every one she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she fought for decades, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"in order to make the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this will also pose considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the appendent effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the grusurry way that one day does not show us any more."</seg>

<seg id="2492">Must diesel drivers participate in the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there are BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5,3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve the gaseous rate of cars in the emission classes between 5 and partially Euro 6.</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammation)."</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claimed the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States, causes gastrife and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the person affected is usually advised to alleviate meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner Artenschutzübereintophan of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the food, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to remove inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result from a inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experimentation has been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found on mice that carry a certain bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a link between a bacteriart - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at Tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflamed intestinal craters, when the same system is wirh with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that enhances the tolerance as she found out that a group of study tastes such cells had, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the wires of the mice were used DNA sequenades and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing on mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterilful environment so that they were missing a intestinal microbial and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria ignited on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were growing in a liquid, and then circulated small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as an active component of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan Metabolism that is known as an indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased about half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us can protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-adrenal products from L. reuteri can develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relationship to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells inflammation over the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues can lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter was produced in Connecticut, beside a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn in accordance with the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit, which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of this because it's an unusual event with high visibility, wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, the deputy Marinekomcommander for aerospace."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn in the morning at 7 p.m. on the occasion of the South Lawn in the morning, and so long stayed until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening was cleared."</seg>

<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave a impetus for the reform of the health reform, which was going on in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to containment the government's regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2886">"according to the disagreement, it may be good that the Mercedesists had not noticed the accident at all."</seg>
<seg id="2887">"the police are now asking for witnesses of the prefom, as well as the driver of the ursors, to get in touch with the commissariat in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060 with the commissariat in Stolzenau."</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report decontamination Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The rainsburgs Domspatzen report to the abnormalities of the pope pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report to the disappearing scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissener, spokesman of the reform movement" We are church "," explained by the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the Benedict XVI I. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would have expressed deep regret on their own omissions, or at that time, false evaluation of the proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that in reporting violence in the Domspatzen will be measured with" two levels "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt no one doubt that it would have to be prevented" "shameful and shameful acts", "but the" "degree of medial manipulation," "said the" "degree of medial manipulation," "says the" "degree medial manipulation," "historians and member of the national Italian bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the all-day experience and is preparing the public opinion that is normal for normal" "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one would like to go to the church and this is a found frescoes.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" "strokes had been a very normal pedagogical means" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply current standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abnormalities often emerged also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who dealt with Ratzinger the reminder band" My Brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take in protection in Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesemann," for all this had nothing to do with him, "" evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the Bistum Regensburg with educating attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were made in between 1945 and early 1990s" "victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, the report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, that from Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment of the students could also be intense."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other defendants in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims are estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases they even connect positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the final report about disruption to the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the" "incidents of Violence of Violence in Protective" "gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a one, many students lift his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which was tangible, when a domain name musically won't be a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when one makes the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather why the name George Ratzinger occurs at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of the abettor or co-knowing of the terrible instances of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the violence of violence at the pre-school eventful outside its impact."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to take it at the moment, to find out of it too late, or take the first hint not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenging school, in which he worked, was perceived by practically all those - as literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent testimony," "sincerely", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent" "and" understanding "," "competent", "" "competent" "and" understanding "and always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about its perfection and its high emotionality, which also led to whale-brooks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he didn't only cast out with chairs and cast the keyword on the ground, but also ear-pears were divided and too freche guys in the hair or ears, he has been deeply regrets for years ago, deeply regrets and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honorary retalice must be said that such educating methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and seventies, were widespread, in parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us, who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced that in a secular school, a state-gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, are the dredging of dreddings."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if one wonders if it is not more likely to do with its familiarity and role as the brother of Benedict XVI, many media has just gone on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him to be still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report decontamination Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also being put into account or co-knowing in regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">"no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault, claims to become familiar to the Domkapellmeister."</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to speak with my father or mother about it," "a duped deputy for the others," It was all very embarrassing for me. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true issue in education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they trusted not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in terms of abnormalities?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a defragmented pupil: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... any case in which he would have had timely findings and could have stopped the relevant perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, accepting that there's more urgent and more clear or more opened than against their parents, internatsleaders, confidence teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report comes to the very clear result:" "that in advance the student and / or their environment entrusted him, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"so, what sexual abuse concerns, Georg Ratzinger is free to share with each co-knowing."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he cannot be accused of discarded him or have brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, there was a lot of" "violence" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown away in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of George Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but that is, in turn, is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is clean separately: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which lad of sawns teachers are recated and malignited and malignited, occurred all at the pre-school in Ethterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states must have existed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the young only to face when they were already on the domain of the cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, like most witnesses emphasise the topic" "Pre-School" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "heavenly" "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the domain?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but just no sawing of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" "many victims estimates the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, they even connect positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at the most left of the accusation, we have seen."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish themselves and from the events at a school, at which he had not worked and responsible, (such a witness) was nothing to hear, and then again at 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Only Georg Ratzinger consistently fails the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzinger director, which was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out this to that, that in the pre-school he will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity was, as the auditors were also banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before this, they have occurred in a legal grey area, as everyone of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was hard to estimate for him, where the sufferers may perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permitted limit was crossed."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, but he had always looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the testing of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, yes, it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards to the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historian talking about the" Fallstrick of Anachronism, "thus the danger, coming to today's moral principles."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse that was vile at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all quite awful, and I am glad that it will finally be reworked."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take protection to Georg Ratzinger, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, thus earths and to pull in the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment then, it has also been strictly held to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his Regensburger's time has returned to you in discussions with you for the book" "My brother of Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic testing also about the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI of his perspective, the Domspade played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I didn't believe that he led a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but that must also be said: without these perfection, without saying unrelated discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world trants, the true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one does not even make a big singer and stand before every success, right in which territory, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"as what a human being, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg Ratzinger really quite well and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep unbelieving and savory people from which one could not imagine that he could not do anything of a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get along with how many former domes still exists today, 23 years after its emeriation, regularly contact him, to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, was therefore strictly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, this may be - but also a lovely respect person, to which they still look up today and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you advance, are tutorials, which were at that time on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome these times.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is a prominent and has an even more prominent brother, to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent, that is behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been released, discharged him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, the anigsaw areas would have acquired a 93-year old man who has acquired great service and without which outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
