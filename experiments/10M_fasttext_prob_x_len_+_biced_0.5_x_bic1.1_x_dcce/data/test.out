Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
this made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I will always be plug@@ ged in drawers or is getting pu@@ ffed out from the outside label , who usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are rather straightforward . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh it , that she is regarded as &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the dearest one spends her time at home , on TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the wh@@ ites they bring the question of the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect &quot; , &quot; said Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a breeze &quot; is An@@ ist@@ on as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyram@@ ide
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses reminded of their celebrations , they said in the fast Gal@@ lop home to the feed @-@ water . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and with it the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again close to horses .
he allowed himself to lead with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse he does not try to take photographs on a horse .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports help exceeded the man from An@@ hausen within the framework of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid .
at awards it lacks the sympathetic athle@@ te .
&quot; cru@@ ising , sil@@ ver@@ nes Lor@@ ed@@ er@@ blatt , champi@@ ons @-@ Tour of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen did not know him .
long is the 18th pri@@ ze@@ winner of the sporting pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for society &apos;s commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money for 25.000 Euro .
&quot; with 15 additional outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold U.S. Master@@ s@@ sie@@ ger was recorded on Saturday at the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
&quot; the repor@@ ters include the athle@@ tics Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ven , the Ru@@ gs Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ e@@ ke , who mirac@@ ulous Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ some Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports enthusiasts had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ating society went to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and tr@@ umps economic policy compared to : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP Trade Agreement - this is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are however in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
who is on the role of the state .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep that small in doubt , and warned that how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to lead the economy to death and regulate , he says . &quot;
&quot; himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , maintains Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return to regulations , and it is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton said against it , The state has certain tasks to meet , he has han@@ di@@ fied chance of opening and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ shipped . &quot;
the democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly opposed to the state @-@ critical te@@ ar@@ d @-@ wing of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; thus , on Tr@@ ump , we could have yet party internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are clear .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ power plants and up@@ take the coal mining in the US again .
oil @-@ mining should also be possible in so far protected areas as to the Par@@ isian climate agreement .
&quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to strengthen and expand the renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two ri@@ vals are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; PP , the transp@@ ose @-@ fish trade agreements , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of us want to isolate the US not from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; this should then be paid better then , call for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
she wants to increase her to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must r@@ enter , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him before , so that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton faces at least from the rich people want to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every fle@@ dged woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost from everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers shelter .
in a large kitchen four women sit .
&quot; each has a baby here , which is at the most one year old . &quot;
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he was curious with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother sits at the top of a table .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare offers in Bavaria , and among other things deals with the topic women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oul@@ ded .
&quot; they live in Munich &apos;s north , one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ eting women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the institution together with Pro Family and the Munich &apos;s welfare benefits . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not excessive to say : any woman who arrives here , has made her flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because they are politically persecuted , because torture or death will threaten or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women under@@ mines other reasons for escape : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ aling themselves secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced to see honorary murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ g for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not uncommon , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us . &quot;
also here all the women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worst .
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the district of Munich , traumati@@ zed them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say they have nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t have to help themselves , there will be more accommodations for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in those of the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are in some common shel@@ ters or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or become women and women together , it can come to - constant violence against women . &quot;
&quot; the wash@@ rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible to women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women felt in need of this protection , you can get rid of the crush on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since she has been around for us that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistance agencies : demands for new labor @-@ measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ uties of the assistance agencies have called their union to approve new labour @-@ measures in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve of more labour measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it was a minister to respond to the concerns about the contract .
assistance and medical students were voted on the rejection of a contract in July which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ently quietly &quot; had to have had said that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and challenged official re@@ negotiations for all E@@ uren concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today provided a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running program of escal@@ ating work measures , which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
disputes led to us that assistance @-@ ups in this year resulted in the first total failure in the history of the N@@ HS .
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A assistance agencies Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the election to rej@@ ecting the agreed Terms , which had been advised by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were still in front of the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for physicians were introduced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; alliance of foreign boards &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months of long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish bac@@ kl@@ ist in the dec@@ il@@ ant hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in reception , I cannot deny that Ankara is going to do this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles worked alli@@ pp@@ ig , and he radi@@ ant barely heat , even for his back @-@ down conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day I described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan was heard so called , it would never make things worse . &quot;
I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in its introduc@@ tions : the de@@ preci@@ ation of a Russian struggle against Turkey on the Syrian border . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was burnt .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to put Russia into his back .
&quot; this was even bigger , as it was committed by a alleged friend . &quot;
re@@ building up again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks were carrying the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations from leading officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria could have benefited from the so @-@ called Islamic state . &quot;
he has veh@@ em@@ ently denied this .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire lie clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan takes first and foremost all the friends who can get after the last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is decreased by nearly 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and char@@ tering companies will be facilitated when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght at the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week predicted the national TV as much as fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported will be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demographic formulated it : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because it &apos;s reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the lasting Gro@@ ll of the European accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ er@@ pi@@ ke is to draw the cool benefits from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara with certainty , the Russian state of State won a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he tried to support the elected government bodies after the tried coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , a matter of course that itself has a deep @-@ sitting fear of reg@@ im@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , as it was a analy@@ st once described , &quot; &quot; Alliance of outer lateral &quot; &quot; : two countries , who turn away from the West and treated badly and now . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently launched the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing parties . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of first discussions , both presidents spoke at the press conference , that they didn &apos;t even understand the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey betra@@ ed it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found to Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as NATO member of the Russian batt@@ jet ab@@ oss - it certainly is better that the two leaders at least talk together . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
&quot; according to the Board of R@@ BS , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand joined the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since been dist@@ anced himself since eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; at this time br@@ anded &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of Po@@ unds at Sponsor@@ ing , from six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange for Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private client business that will receive more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investors brand as well as the brand where our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands .
&quot; as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now , that we do not pursue global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers in these brands .
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that the Six Nations sponsor@@ ing will no longer continue , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport @-@ sponsor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very Cypri@@ ot three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see a lot of changes . &quot;
&quot; we can re @-@ launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

I &apos;m very happy that it has happened at New@@ market because I have landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am relie@@ ved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the Ju@@ bel on when he is taking victory in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
L@@ ester pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth @-@ time Der@@ by@@ sie@@ ger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career path &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey on the modern and it is not a surprise that he reached this milestone only a few ahead of him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect , which distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already got 6,000 wins , if he would not just be a weekly and Grand tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has suffered winner in the UK for nearly 30 years which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount

it was nerve wr@@ acking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments win , including its famous &quot; smooth Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulty in the beginning , when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to its best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has said earlier that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin fired Staff by Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expec@@ tedly released his staff member by Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest confidentiality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who has been Ivan@@ ov@@ s for 2012 since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his conclusion on the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is called ( in Russian ) that it was later transferred to the chief manager and deputy director of the government . &quot;
he said about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your business as head of President and controls to implement your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV broad@@ cast@@ ers on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked for his post to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convincing the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest conspir@@ ators Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the staff was res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; so , here is the result of a kind of power of power ? &quot;
this is not what I know .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; is true that I have asked you in early 2012 in a conversation I could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been the chairman of the Russian office for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; as Putin reached the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , who trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; it was once believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin would viol@@ ate the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became President three and a half years later .

Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four inter@@ connection of the &quot; clo@@ ak &quot; , &quot; the completion of finishing each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge @-@ section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ ted rop@@ es . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Keit@@ h Brown appointed the construction site today and was one of the first , which went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineer of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which alone was used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the loop between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge ende@@ ck is a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge over their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks are held in Ros@@ y@@ th a beg@@ gar@@ ment for the deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the closure is setting forward @-@ looking high@@ - and deep @-@ building .
&quot; after installing the last road junction and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to then close the gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 mil@@ lim@@ etres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , approx . 6,000 tons weigh and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; sacred , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , win@@ dy - on each side they bore only a few mil@@ lim@@ etres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men will have &quot; happiness &quot; to be alive
&quot; three men were fortunate to be &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; after they were thrown away from the fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after one crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in safety while their boat had moved from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned us the worst off , &quot; &quot; said the head of the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blowing the boat out of their reach until we left water &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 , and at a bo@@ je without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board the shore boat and were brought back to the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; The three men who were cast into the water , have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot @-@ engine did not have an emergency con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , however , which del@@ etes the boat from the person &apos;s pot by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone today knew about these men .
badly hurt - man sti@@ ckers on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when this came to the apartment , he was twice on them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old has been har@@ med by the hand and the body .
the police could establish the perpetrators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this aler@@ ted then as a result of his sister .
&quot; together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street she met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old houses his sister on the side and grab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds a budget of cheap apartments ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and Green Party mean : investors should in future be much stronger in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; at the next R@@ ats@@ session . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Greens : who wants to build urban areas in the future , needs to be 20 percent of all the apartments known as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be found in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute settlement in the city hall is , however , &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how do you work with investors , who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments build as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing program , which will cost millions and will have to be financed . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as viol@@ a : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the political groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few provisions as possible .
the left does not want to make hardness for investors .
&quot; regardless of it , Brat@@ mann , bah@@ ne becomes a tigh@@ tening of the situation at the housing market . &quot;
&quot; when the action concept is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; yet the program is not entirely different : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you like the loss of more about 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion is going out over the next few years ? &quot;
until the year 2020 it will be 500 apartments .
&quot; in order to prevent this , the plann@@ er spokes@@ person in Nicole Palm , should now be bought on ongoing ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to pick up apartments back into the price of price . &quot;
this is possible in the Western city .
on one fell sw@@ oop the problem can be solved .
because in the west @-@ city the end @-@ end dates are coming .
some 1800 apartments could get back to the price @-@ binding apartments in the price of affordable housing .
only : this is not wanting the owners , the housing companies do not want . &quot;
&quot; after all , the number of social housing in the west @-@ city will dramatically increase , removed from the goal of the so @-@ called diar@@ rhe@@ a . &quot;
there will no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Greens expect that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must take into the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teen@@ ager and child do not go out anymore after playing , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens , at screens , was killed in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about to get people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities outdoors are not mutually exclusive .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that over@@ l@@ sted the server .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone to outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that were tr@@ acked with a GPS once they were once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger younger , joined the expectation , and sprang up for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that put the &quot; average &quot; person each day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5.000 users re@@ pro@@ secuted , the Washington Post recently shared that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of watched people that exercise each day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to get active &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are getting bored and come from people who are looking for . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; whoever drives regular sport , reduces its chances to become cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full on Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , that they are fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ aces that must always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already pursue our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be left with time .
&quot; however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activity can be combined in the real world and help with many people on the hunt will help to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ en
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamically on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the bar .
stunning on the floor .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ e@@ ver .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the multi @-@ fighting title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ en@@ sk@@ amer@@ ica A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ zz@@ ler Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es is tur@@ rets at the pig @-@ beam during the single multi @-@ struggle of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ osexual American player who wins a multi @-@ fighting title and strengthened the fifth , whereas she strengthened its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was ended at that moment .
&quot; this success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of its sports@@ art , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that took a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympi@@ asi@@ ti@@ ff of 1984 Mary Lou ret@@ ton from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they expected a last test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but instead of her and a last @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas will be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace up , after they won gold and silver in the single @-@ fighting in@@ ale of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she was on the farewell party who was reti@@ ring in retirement , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as an instructor . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted on the top , during their long road to the top , never the future to have planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their land exercises - which included their typical tumor pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by Train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school flu@@ ke in the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , there has been no more competitive competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning series , which will stop for as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina slightly led by two rotation , dec@@ ep@@ ed the picture . &quot;
sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord and bo@@ aters - in which image it holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she took back with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig @-@ beam again - and he continued with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged them gently as they expected her final - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears covered in image shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collective book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina went . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team @-@ capitalism had called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; which is called a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground @-@ exercise she cast into the audience c@@ ousin , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared doub@@ t@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for what is concerned , it quickly has a completely new meaning of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial production in the car shot in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl killed in one of the most fatal attacks for a decade in the first series of serial attacks , while they were talking in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefan@@ ie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was parked in a move , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire@@ arms , while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is in the report to read . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the triple murder did not have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ survived , since the att@@ acker did not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to become a closer look at it , whether it is associated with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; all in all , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic dwelling within four months in nine attacks seven people were killed and two other wounded . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , distributed Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects of several vehicles has been used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to establish the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was to be hosp@@ it@@ alized due to its injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; lin@@ ers , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a report report on the shooting at an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder and it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeve , and sur@@ passed a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball frag@@ mente from the engine . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with microphone : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his aging has Ed@@ mund micro cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy knew nothing . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I did not make it . &quot;
I did not create that .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course you have left on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alize it .
&quot; my first answer to that was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could not sit down until his third year of age and he can still not speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and bicycle ride .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund was conceived for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign in , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to CB@@ S News . &quot;
but there is no typical string -- tells them . Ed@@ mund has invented a number of characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ er or the Zi@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the coron@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
&quot; I asked , what is going to happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
&quot; for a long time , I haven &apos;t been asked for the prognosis for a long time , because I am not expecting me to really say someone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the coron@@ avirus .
it gets better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fierce rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi &quot;
fierce rain falls and large @-@ faced floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to rest on Friday the emergency . it is calculated the whole Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Ri@@ pp@@ is flooded with large @-@ scale floods in extreme rainf@@ all , reported the national weather service . &quot;
governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards shared with the local authorities in constant contact with the local authorities and have already been on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ov of the Governor , shared with that the inquiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa has requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used across wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ anas up to Saturday .
weather services rendered in@@ toler@@ able that in this area could be additional 3 to 5 inches to rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas was used on Friday a fle@@ d@@ early n@@ war@@ n@@ system , while in the area of Mobile it was still ra@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are found in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , all probability are reached via the weekend of record . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be floo@@ ding many houses in the curtains near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that an up@@ stream in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , since these streams only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Dra@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi River in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday already at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue operations still t@@ apped people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , which rose strongly over night . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives nearby , warned . &quot;
&quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it achieved my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a strongh@@ old of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ per had saved all three in a large military truck , and they had brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; had quickly expanded &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the bodies of ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions are considered .
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer located near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was considerably fu@@ eled by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
&quot; the authorities have passed that heavy rainf@@ alls and road vessels in@@ und@@ ated the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa par@@ ish , and class failure in five bor@@ ough@@ s . &quot;
the CB@@ S @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an assistant in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 was flooded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which now both were flooded . &quot;
&quot; the Vor@@ steh@@ er of the church Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were sponsored by the floo@@ d@@ water . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ ables were established to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two d@@ ging streets were closed due to the floo@@ d@@ water and sand@@ bags available for residents to work , we hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ d@@ ging that we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in this tip , the Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys , that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his details a handful of houses must be reported on Thursday as in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday we have not been reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I saw water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; town@@ son said , &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; by bul@@ lets &quot; , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police divide that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week was already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified him for CB@@ S Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents gave that Brown suffered several bugs , including in the lamb , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was at his transport to hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was perme@@ ated by balls , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the sender . &quot;
I can simply not believe this .
the child &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transm@@ itter that it is expected to recover .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
also shot three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was recorded at the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reported the transm@@ itter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police are determined precisely whether under one of the most recent men of the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to be a crus@@ fire between several guns .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ y@@ le@@ cloth@@ s for storm @-@ guns , which have been tr@@ acked up to different storm , s@@ wir@@ es the scene . &quot;
it seems obvious that this is clearly around a continuous battle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the trail , were H@@ ül@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; in this way there seems to have been several armed fighter here , which were very active , &quot; shared police p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia with the radio station . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were met in the area .
&quot; there came to no feast , and the police currently checks according to reports according to the surveillance video . &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl was hit by a qui@@ es@@ ome on the arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane in front of her house .
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ icious one .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine at the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic practice at the turbul@@ ence and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been doing so heavily since 1984 at any Summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three turtle inside , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , rounds , makes every pride . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the United States .
it has solidi@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad and the Americas . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible performance of the thre@@ e@@ fold world in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tical rout@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , heter@@ osexual American , who won gold at an individual student event for women Gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witn@@ essing the top of this sport , but so see turn@@ classes in the whole country not . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four tur@@ ers in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that tur@@ ers is a more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily unite in private turn@@ tables that will be maintained by parents who continue for training , furnis@@ hing , travel , and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ers and families ) . the list can be dropped to any number . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs to support the business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner receive their entire training and that is for families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ erin by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; we have to get inspired to the con@@ gregations au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , enabling a high @-@ performance and easy accessible gym . &quot;
I founded my gym of 20 years .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ ers in Harlem for more than 15,000 cities ( above all black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winner . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality turmoil that make the opportunity to learn from this great olymp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; turbul@@ ence develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for health and for educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; Simone , A@@ ly , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic team and thank you for giving her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance agencies would like to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by adopting a re@@ formed agreement with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7@@ ,000 assistants in the election , refused . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans revealed to introduce the contract compulsory , and said that the N@@ HS had ordered himself in a &quot; &quot; nobody and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and would be harmful to any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first aid agencies should receive a new treaty , which contains changes to night and weekly work , in order to improve care for un@@ scheduled watch times . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the leader of the BM@@ A Com@@ promis@@ ers for assistance agencies shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance institutions have been committed to the proposed agreement as before serious concerns , especially that it will treat the current occupancy crisis and it will be ad@@ minister to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks that remain still remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty , progress must be made and time is running out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to solve the dispute through conversations with the government for the sake of reluc@@ tance to take part and sometimes look at o@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened that of a promise , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made the last month on it , that his door was always up . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , raising the penetration and address the concerns of assistance . &quot;
&quot; if he did not do so , they have made the assistance systems clear that they are ready to carry out further work measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a par@@ enth@@ esis of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , since nur@@ ses and specialists were included to meet doctors on the strike @-@ chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by adopting the re@@ formed contract with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better en@@ closure for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance systems , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS staff , called for the assistance services to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work@@ ings achieve nothing of the only little , but had already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only worries , hard@@ ship and interruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we have spoken of the assistance of the assistance assistant and with the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries positively to the concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and of the wh@@ istle . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses and gender equality in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the observ@@ ance of agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day - medication that can reduce heart @-@ color color@@ fully
&quot; thousands of heart @-@ color patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , having been recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time . &quot;
the con@@ tra @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a her@@ edi@@ tary disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke , or another heart attack . &quot;
the regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has advised a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has advised a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 14@@ 0.000 people suffer from a heart attack every year , and a quarter of that suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart @-@ coloured and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arteries , the Bel@@ ä@@ ge form . &quot;
&quot; if the day breaks apart , it may cause a blood c@@ utter , which causes blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cell is sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood flow and the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
&quot; people who had already a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Information Center , commented : &quot; despite the availability of secondary medicines have suffered a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack or stroke , often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stroke in people who had already a heart attack .
&quot; through a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand options available to thousands of people , who can benefit from it . &quot;
information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft resolution recommends no treatment that goes over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor leaves voting in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sen@@ Rah@@ man was removed last year on dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor led to that far @-@ wi@@ dened election in Muslim communities is ignor@@ ing how an exter@@ min@@ ent government report revealed today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , the former cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , verb@@ ally attacks the police , electoral and Rath@@ houses to have ignored the evidence of &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and commun@@ alist Government , who is now an antagon@@ isms , said that the intimid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set sli@@ ces outside of electoral cabins to protect the voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a guide , in order to prove their identity . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , non @-@ removing inks to the finger of a person when they give their voting agree to prevent someone twice . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to par@@ is@@ ations and decisions of non @-@ official com@@ ers or working groups .
&quot; it is not only for electoral fraud , but is also intended to promote the municipal government in front of the broader corruption and finance culture , which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets franchise than in the East of London .
&quot; last year , a Special Court decided that the am@@ ti@@ fying Mayor Lut@@ fur for Rah@@ man should be dis@@ missed in the corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; and that he had been sil@@ enced to his critics with se@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is supposed to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , where a person was chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud across the country .
he expressed especially alar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including filling out , to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in its report it says : &quot; &quot; as proof has been appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , particularly women and young people in order to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ ana background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions could not have ignored such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ tions and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban , that political activ@@ ators offer op@@ tionally to stop &quot; harvest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory to immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
options are considered to be voters before choosing after your ticket .
&quot; not removing ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
systematic check@@ ups about the nationality of a person to perform to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit to requests for an automatic brie@@ fing .
b@@ anning that political activists must deal with full let@@ sel@@ ections and res@@ sources of let@@ sel@@ ections .
police force the authority to set off guard to electoral stations .
&quot; a change of law , which facilit@@ ates an indictment for intimid@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( representing Law 1983 ) . &quot;
photo@@ grap@@ hing in electoral stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the pre @-@ gy@@ ms ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensive training of the training , to ensure that the employees are usually enforce that voters do alone in the cabin cabin . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that , after the Tower of Ham@@ lets , no claim has been provided . &quot;
&quot; the voting court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupted and illegal practices as un@@ deaf , &quot; he said . &quot;
it has been guilty due to a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the most effective &quot; &quot; check@@ box &quot; &quot; of the Town Hall . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the judgment place in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a waiting signal . &quot;
&quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double @-@ Double in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ators in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of edge and band who proved to be an impressive double @-@ president in the Cambridge University of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one in order to make gold fighting athle@@ te who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one should believe the social media faith .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the moment on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ as , which have more than just a certain similarity with Hol@@ ly@@ a &apos;s most famous . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; except K@@ ates double , in the cycle , many people on the internet showed how to be a certain arch@@ ing of the Gem@@ ini of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher actually got the ins@@ anity in the social media with and gave to him that he has already heard about his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no big similarity , except the facial hair , distributed Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I see it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly step into the center : the emerging similarity between the British Far East Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast ali@@ af@@ ina with its large , expressive eyes shall be able to pass through a double @-@ step in the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similar eyeb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver medals in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , during the American Nathan Adrian Lev@@ itt , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes &quot;
not the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy about that others like the similarities
&quot; put theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their cont@@ entment that &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular comparisons made Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their sm@@ iles , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which shows its own beautiful , wide smile , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle union . &quot;

&quot; Emm@@ ar Mac@@ le@@ lane t@@ wee@@ te , &quot; Do@@ es of the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 year old s@@ wimm@@ ers died from China &quot; like a pig . &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the dark 4 x 6@@ isti@@ l@@ cre@@ staff@@ el for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the conclusion , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , when asked him many of the speech . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users did not get back , when they heard how absurd Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was &quot;
&quot; another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you do not present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment from Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming output . &quot;
&quot; it was a unhappy chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; at the end of more than 90 times , C@@ BC apologi@@ zed to the people who responded to the comments on Twitter . &quot;
the commentary box of Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; C@@ BC informed his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users , who had compl@@ ained about the comments made by Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
the network exc@@ used also quickly and gave out a message .
&quot; we regret it sincerely , that these statements were made and that it has been made to be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
we quickly apologi@@ zed to our viewer last night and exc@@ used by our followers in social media .
&quot; to clarify , Byr@@ on comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a unhappy chosen formulation . Byr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald apologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment of time to apologi@@ ze for the comment , which I did after the Women &apos;s cre@@ staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olympic exchange , he said . &quot;
&quot; I took me to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ires about woman who under@@ wear ling@@ erie in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see them , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , they pat@@ ter@@ ned the way it saw in it , moved them out and laid it back into the shelf . &quot;
she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tasted the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who had tried at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear it again and left the shop without buying something . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the selling space , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the situation , pulled off their own strings and pants , and tried them . &quot;
&quot; they did not even try to find a slightly discreet place to do it - it was just there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ ing , when they moved the under@@ pants , who obviously did not like it , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before she decided that her nothing fell , turned back and went out . &quot;
&quot; it did not seem to distur@@ b that they watched someone - or think about the person , which in circumstances would buy the under@@ pants , which she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; as contradic@@ tory , someone would take shelter with home that had another person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I &apos;ve heard , the staff tries to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had an@@ gled them and returned , and they were not washed away . &quot;
&quot; said a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident , which occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were taken out of sale .
how to protect yourself using Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to handle armed predat@@ ors on the distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to shoot for your rob@@ ber the mir@@ rors . &quot;
&quot; when you turn off from behind , you should turn out to be a first turn , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move from the desert line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free el@@ bows .
&quot; strike it then with the knee in the gro@@ in and turn , while the att@@ acker bows down before pain , the weapon made out of his hands . let him move with the run into the face and move back@@ wards as they set the gun upon him . &quot;
&quot; at att@@ ackers , approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the outer line , grab the weapon and turn it so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time transfer the weight to the gun and suggest the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon from its grip before they move back@@ wards and set the gun upon him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi pres@@ et .
&quot; but remember that it is on the safest way to over@@ pass your money - unless you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
travel@@ er Ian Wright sch@@ t for a guide to his tongue at the busi@@ est places of Europe
a bri@@ tish travel@@ er under@@ went its immune system and spice up a serious test - by placing some of the tough@@ est and most ek@@ el@@ dest places of Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel@@ er author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shr@@ ink his course on a euro shot , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dish@@ ing kno@@ b and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the immune system of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the finish of each object he used a l@@ umin@@ ometer , to show themselves and to show us what he will join . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was created under the title &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; some surprising results in day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , b@@ aking the ins@@ kno@@ b of a draw@@ back tube , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said to physicians and medical professionals concerning the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he ab@@ stain@@ ed , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines , jour@@ ne@@ yed by the world and ate a peculiar and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations , up to dish@@ wash@@ ers of toilets , the task presented its immune system to definitely be below a sample &quot;
&quot; in film he told : &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms , and mud . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his trial coating showed a l@@ umin@@ om@@ le@@ age of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ age number is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse , after their l@@ umin@@ om@@ age over 4000 units was , while freshly washed hands one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different locations such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this is the worst thing I have had in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
&quot; I will do nothing here , because it is ec@@ lec@@ tic here . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturers of dairy products vali@@ o .
&quot; the company received Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both Mil@@ ca@@ vities and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiot@@ ics .
&quot; we brought crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which ended with it that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of intestinal health and how it associated with the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide more information in an interesting way . &quot;
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have tasted my respect for Ian , if he would have tasted some of things that I have instruc@@ ted to him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian res@@ tro@@ om that will be shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to attach them and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty goodies in film , too . &quot;
&quot; in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 per cent of all respondents in the year 2015 associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products that have been included in the l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys the devast@@ ation of social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social apartment after a del@@ usion with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because it wre@@ cked their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the property of the con@@ domini@@ um took possession of property in a mis@@ sive state . &quot;
&quot; the walls reported cl@@ ed holes on , wooden di@@ mp@@ s were opened , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family moved out and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation .
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the household administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was a real nightmare for the people and I believe that people do not have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not so nice part Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , which meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which had attached the family , street fights with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ists , intimid@@ ated by residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and floo@@ ding scre@@ ams , streams and flight . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement was in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
have been tra@@ ded in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past drugs .
neighbours told that they saw her on the streets and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ fted her and her partner this week by the property after having extended them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily .
&quot; the dolphins have been che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said that their lives was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; It was not afraid of anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are amazing .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that we are not familiar !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had a family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , for which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the floo@@ ding side of the council &apos;s house were cast rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it was ad@@ minister to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family as a delic@@ acy is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing draws . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extremely difficult and had to look back to their neighbours to their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have been courageous to us and have made us know the information we have done . &quot;
I hope that this development will take con@@ sol@@ ation in some neighbors and the message is taught that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash at the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don got a fine sentence after it was guilty of the possessions of a drug class B in commercial view .
&quot; it claimed that money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 with an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room@@ mates of the house were made with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
police says that they will act ten@@ ant who do not stick to the house@@ order
&quot; Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the del@@ ity was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not stick to the house order . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ allegations , as well as those who were damaged by such a conduct , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate anti @-@ criminal and anti @-@ social behavior , which continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;

&quot; the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , and so deeply flying that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that the jet due to the bad visibility of vision by itself in the proximity @-@ being surface @-@ fires flew somewhat deeper than usual , however , the air forces ins@@ ists that security at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; surface fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese country , in which four people came to death on the island Madeira . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump Sur@@ t ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Re@@ public@@ ans will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in the traditionally conservative federal states . &quot;
presidential guard Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can High burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ sp@@ ig and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire has expressed something like concerns raised , such as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after spending 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , now the doubt of his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame were false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he again took his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Re@@ public@@ s high bur@@ dock
Utah is a secure bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey of Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitor from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; other institutes do see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
&quot; in danger , Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview of the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ ics : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be it right , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I will return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press report , the Party of Tr@@ ump threatens to reach funds to support his election campaigns , he should not present any better query values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , one sees the candidates of the re@@ public@@ ans for the Congress to become stronger among the arms . &quot;

K@@ eni@@ as L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ te threatens the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach to his home . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee shared with , as soon as a disciplinary commission set up , in order to examine the case . &quot;
&quot; a ken@@ ian@@ ical function@@ ary had communicated that the earlier Spr@@ inter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village have given a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
that was the team deri@@ vation K@@ eni@@ as reported by the dop@@ ing controversi@@ es .
&quot; the World association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case to use their own investigations , divided a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; says it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control unit and has turned out as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , issued the sample and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
&quot; it was owned by the ac@@ creditation of the athletes , who stood on the list for the training controls of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup quadru@@ ple over 800 meters .

Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director of Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
&quot; the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian conductor Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older sister Maria .
she recalls with melanchol@@ y to her lovers with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there is Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , whom I considered Roman &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate !
sealing is for him a necessity .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his sight , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is at all very important ! &quot;
for the American film@@ maker Philip World Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; today we have gone to the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ ans have gone to New York and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as powerful today as it was at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London Schul@@ chen , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za sult@@ ana , one of three British school cities that left London last year to join the IS , repor@@ tedly died in Syria . &quot;

&quot; it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air@@ attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ wark of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family after she had the war to leave the war , and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is therein - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it , to go into a war area - people from going to ever meet this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school cities went to the east of London to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sult@@ ana family was told that she married a ISIS @-@ fighter in Syria - and became a widow in less than a few months .

Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass cur@@ sed
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed hard@@ ships , &quot; says the note of the Gü@@ len @-@ related Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects ten thousand of refugees trying to flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the association @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh action of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community has hosted a mass cur@@ sed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with ten thousand thousands , medium term with some hundreds of thousands of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight against minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; Leader of the &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already over@@ flowing with pen@@ alties for months ago , be 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the dec@@ eit@@ ted put@@ sch were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will now want to start in Europe if they are re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that is taking refugees themselves in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association approved the targeted threat of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in alpine cities . &quot;
that Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the entry to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or sold in recent hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the association demanded that the German government is positioned itself &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ch@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement was also feared to escape many Turks .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the fire @-@ market as a Gü@@ len followers destro@@ ys teachers and other academics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed hard@@ ships , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ related Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of Serbia , the Turks adopted the largest group in Germany before the coup in Germany . &quot;
&quot; at the point of June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus barely 29 per cent of all as they have been entitled to be justified ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they are not faced with war , poverty or perspective ge@@ aring . &quot;
&quot; asylum entitled to the Basic Law are solely political , i.e. from the state of state , individually persecuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; then go , where it we@@ h@@ eth &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia must not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for then , as far as far it is not : summer holidays , heat , and the landing stage - that is passing . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced of the choices are on vacation .
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no locals , so are not allowed to choose the country . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , air balloon , flyer and at the end , count , only ti@@ ev@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has not yet to pass a campaign for Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , has now been clear in surveys behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting how strongly new@@ com@@ er Af@@ d cuts and what remains to be left at the end of the coalition .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from its big pl@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , just as it did before his legendary wor@@ t@@ kar@@ st predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors with old feet have got and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the fault at the flowering of Af@@ d . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create &quot; the rise of the right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which is likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you go to the wrong time at the right place electoral campaign . &quot;
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ known Merkel ; Merkel Par@@ ag@@ sw@@ ath District is located in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not coinci@@ de , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; this was probably the majority from other Länder , &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s a shame not to hear anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the northeast CD@@ U does largely avoid the usual electoral campaigns on market places and above shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; so , Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; sub@@ ordinate roll . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has noted that , on the land , the base is br@@ ittle that it needs to be very strict , again to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is about the left , the SPD , the Greens : in the wake of the country there is hardly any present . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaign Kok@@ ert to his collaborators : &quot; &quot; they must go then where it we@@ h@@ eth , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to an especially committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats in surveys were last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just outside the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the election in 2011 , the SPD was still clearly won with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Green , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should make the leap into the agricultural day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue and do their election campaign largely into the internet .
&quot; online electoral campaign , &quot; is called the Regional Leader Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green electoral fighters on trace search for native stim@@ uli under the holidays . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the leading edge of excellence , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ eric lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; voting in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 reconstruction : Gast@@ ein plants suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B is re@@ mod@@ elled 27 , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for those responsible for building work , start at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and only at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is all@@ ying praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything quite z@@ ily , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the Jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no reference .
&quot; the construction site could be moved on the weekend at the half time as scheduled , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; blessed will also be the kidn@@ apping of those responsible for the construction work , for example , when it comes to set up homes . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , the block of the asphalt road has been lifted in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen , and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation in the place has relaxed . &quot;
citizens can now go back from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the so@@ fter traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; says the deputy management of the rehabilitation manager Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach @-@ Street , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , haf@@ ts and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths searched and more likely to rely on their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to many trucks in residential areas fran@@ ce .
&quot; since the speed limitation has not been observed , the community also called for the measurement @-@ vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were significant crossing , &quot; says King , who made himself a location on the spot . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 hour kilometres at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into their cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to turnover in them , each one you ask , can look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment has hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; on the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight decline , &quot; &quot; but also one that is naturally missing &quot; the run . &quot;
the most active are the restaurants along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already existence @-@ threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the hosts have taken it hard . &quot;
&quot; it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we need to be glad about every euro sales .
&quot; the average income bu@@ ff@@ ered on &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road@@ ens@@ ation had returned its operation &quot; &quot; to two years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half were released would have reacted the policy differently .
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the reference to the site benef@@ iting otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 Now it must also take the disadvantages , which result in the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where so much has been hand@@ crafted . &quot;
&quot; with all boxes , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will persist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now less frequently subject to the complicated road of traffic , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive off , it is also elsewhere beautiful . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises of BS@@ E and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work to its customers for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , this is already brutal . &quot;
constantly in the name of counter @-@ terrorism to laws .
&quot; after recent attacks , Interior Minister Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a cum@@ ulative status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ er say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals were politically reasonable , &quot; said the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new safety packages . &quot;
they over@@ demand no one .
&quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I took part in the part of it . &quot;
&quot; but as the Minister of Interior , he is on the basis of results and in a &quot; &quot; able consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach showed a little time , before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority has to worry about the tu@@ b@@ aking co@@ ded communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany must transp@@ ose multiple EU specifications on air @-@ air and weapons law . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in the part of Mai@@ zi@@ ère , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts up a second attempt for proposals which did not have to do with the SPD : he wants sympath@@ ise for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ bs jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; he still consider this to be reasonable , and challenging also nothing , which in the co @-@ operation partner did not have any chance . &quot;
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they have partially in himself : he plans for de@@ port@@ ations and more opportunities for de@@ ple@@ ting people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country to check their smartphone in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security examination .
&quot; with D@@ ul@@ ls for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than now - such as those who commit crimes , or consciously throw away their papers to lend their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legally native .
some also still un@@ wi@@ g@@ ors and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of opponents , for example - the question arises : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be put in speech that the attacks from Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about the high refugee numbers for safety . &quot;
&quot; and things that most people occupy deeply , are not settled in election times even in election times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous into focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral fights . &quot;
the Union and the SPD can therefore contribute increasingly to the issue of internal security .
in the past few days it was high between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ gan@@ ger dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a safety policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior , in which the res@@ ists also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also blowing here to conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
from a desc@@ endant of the double pass it is nothing .
we have committed the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to make new , be not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he had constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ ent on all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ an agent , it is necessary to show itself only . &quot;
there is a lot of things in which the dispute could be done .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ claim with the issue of inner security . &quot;
&quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only time to talk to conversation and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
nor comes Volkswagen glimp@@ ses .
&quot; despite diesel @-@ and@@ als , the ex@@ tradition line rise worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it is running round .
in the recall there is a vor@@ tex about a term .
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year for the ship@@ ments .
&quot; Europe &apos;s largest car@@ makers can continue in the course of the course of the year , despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets further to a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July the Core of VW mainly weak@@ ened in Western Europe , and thus weigh@@ ed the total sales , as the company quoted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; world VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent fewer vehicles sold than in the previous year &apos;s year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China is the second most important market , sales of 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ d@@ gy the ship@@ ments to almost a sixth .
&quot; brand Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann launched the weak@@ est figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there have been a different economic framework in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote also deb@@ ited to res@@ ignation from the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust was escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected house of the Lower Saxony is in any case possible , by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months it is just a drop of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated Head of Fred Kap@@ pler from January to July was continuing to show a sales spl@@ us from January to July .
&quot; 1,3 per cent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software testing .
VW around 2.5 million cars are calling for an upgrade to the workshops alone in Germany alone .
&quot; in the course of the re@@ armament , VW , that the re@@ modeling of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ armament of vehicles , there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor output . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ makers place the customer after the re@@ armament a &quot; &quot; equal &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; the &quot; focus &quot; had been reported , Volkswagen has given its German customers a guarantee for competitive diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Commerce .
the Department of Department has been confirmed that there were this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfill the requirements of my enquiry commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor output after the re@@ armament does not take place , and all type of relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business travel .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; , Volkswagen has the possibility that customers can come back for example a half year after an upgrade with a motor system - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also , in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that with any other damage , there is nothing to do with the ab@@ sc@@ andal that has nothing to do with regard to possible warran@@ ties , as it was meant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see requires further savings in the future as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers , which park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ to @-@ date accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; &quot; must not fear , to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this charge demands the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 Euro on tox@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ to @-@ date accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; it has been 40 million euros , who could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and that he could not be able to invali@@ date it . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; said the banker . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the costs are now going to pass after the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; the cash simply can be put in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen Bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the banker . &quot;
most of the customers would have understanding and have rarely changed on other assets .
only a few stro@@ ked to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative union of Bavaria said , &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear alone , be &quot; &quot; economical permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for bank account , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
&quot; with criminal off@@ ences for deposits , from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian Pop@@ ular and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank had made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay a nationwide delivery for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong in banks and savings . &quot;
&quot; a banker said , at Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see there is &quot; a cliff which is equipped from the property a little lush . &quot;
&quot; that can be a small bank for a small bank if they are free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 @-@ founded cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ likes , Kre@@ uth and Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , renowned actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is currently not known to the cooperative union of Bavaria , which is currently no further banks charge for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared : &quot; the threshold , to the neg@@ atives to go against the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and there is the migration of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .
destination plates : who does actually buy records ?
difficult men middle ages love boards .
&quot; before you visit the commentary in order to over@@ saw him under the pseudon@@ ym non @-@ le@@ en@@ ig@@ en@@ men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement direc@@ ts itself from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the many @-@ expressed reconstruction of records is not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the re@@ percussions of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record people retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , I carry my hands and be wild before I ste@@ al , keep my hands and tell something certain as : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let us take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos is slowly adding to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera to the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetable by watching . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I of S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged ) to the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , presumably on the 20 ) follow , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores in order to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I appreciate already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this record @-@ plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I &apos;m not followed home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he did not afford to purchase and buy objects that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early seven@@ ties , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy the records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and happy to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my l@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believe also that many customers who meet , which he meets to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and causes themselves to be bought back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the rec@@ tory of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to realize that record stores provides a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system . &quot;
&quot; some plate @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound@@ atten@@ tions , of objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WH@@ Z . &quot;
that is with me as collectors so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff from a record stack .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people bought a record of the last month , they have not yet been listened to . &quot;
&quot; the survey was also found out that 41 % possess a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I saw through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men aged aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy as@@ pe@@ kt &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone has only recently been here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musician . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who come first . &quot;
&quot; stop that has devoted to the gram@@ ophone nearly a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos , teenagers and women middle ages . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts New synthes@@ iz@@ ers and far @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz bri@@ ers from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but na@@ ve mental trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if one stands beside someone over 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs in the business for several minutes and looks at the variation of the plates for sale . &quot;
it is more likely to have a showcase of a showcase than a large purchase .
&quot; she does not earn much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or another way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives out with a loved si@@ gh si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , from which it is said that a new generation of plate @-@ lovers should have inspired : urban out@@ fits . &quot;
&quot; while I give the impression to mu@@ te the jeans hotels , I watched a group of young teenagers , group@@ ed for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and daughter are considering to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees her - maybe because they are merely purely decorative , some so far above it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; disk @-@ art . &quot;
&quot; considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry , and some customers might send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , that is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research inquiries made that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they let , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and records , which exist in reality , record business and in Online@@ for@@ es exist un@@ considered . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the bum@@ ble through records of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while taking the stub@@ born look of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ wrong moder@@ ator , which prot@@ ru@@ des through the shoulders of nothing of the middle ages . &quot;
the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k is the longest living verteb@@ ra - Vide@@ os@@ ks

French Court re@@ jects its offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; in a court proceedings this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ aries , in which persons within the camp goods , sell from cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and the risk of fire and recovery risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the stat@@ ely supported association and other groups , do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary business , but spatial that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &apos; was absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants play a much bigger role than just people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas will offer quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; cafe .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; for these children of a catastrophe were , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
&quot; the two aid agencies help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of Mig@@ rants announced on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle @-@ camp lives over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of new arrivals over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympia disappointment : Martin remains militant
&quot; despite his disappointing appearance at the olymp@@ ic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin will not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; I continue to keep the World Cup at a glance , stay confident and fights , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
he did not explain an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut he did not .
&quot; to me it is honest , hard to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he had to analyze in peace which causes reasons to play Deb@@ ak@@ el .
&quot; at the time of the time of the World Cup in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything we have changed in recent times .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ he must adjust to the next generation of speed measurements : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der is to be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for instance at random points , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to sandy bridges with temporary tem@@ p , there is often no necessary infrastructure to care there with a stationary leaf@@ let for compliance with speed . &quot;
a permanent mobile assembly can be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery stops at uninterrupted measuring run five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded on several tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed b@@ umps , as well as access bot@@ t@@ es after time , stri@@ pe and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly advanced state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with a trailer cl@@ utch . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not simply bre@@ wed , he is distr@@ acted in the measurement , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way will also disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the leaf against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to claims by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hes foreign authorities with the new technology : recently , France has bought 100 pieces of Georgian , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening to a down@@ time stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the degeneration stage here in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in the handling , side @-@ stepping , night run , line @-@ run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - its first Olympic Medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was griev@@ ed by the not too bad tro@@ st@@ preis of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they were able to take pride in their efforts in this tournament , in which they followed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the substantial defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
but independent of that Fi@@ ji would have fought a 15 @-@ man team in the form of a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England of Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , they lost under Ryan of every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they just lost one .
&quot; this cap is going to do , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and took the attacks GB@@ s with fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell an and Co . an , as if you run in driving buses run . the World Series winner went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went off in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wai has another attack on the right hand , which he changed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely adopted the ball .
&quot; a sound@@ ing T@@ ails of Mitch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but Fi@@ ji has only stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner follows a touch down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ p@@ endant and there was still a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured through further weak tac@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while the GB is still worth it . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ b gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long for the south se@@ ein@@ gs whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake with another attempt in recent seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and the UK re@@ pl@@ ated crus@@ hed into the lawn . &quot;
previous on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a scarce se@@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored one gate among the items in the second half . &quot;
&quot; brilliant L@@ son of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ D team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing
there will be no otic gold than with these games and that is what will mean .
&quot; from the first rowing back to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve , who go down in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if only the Bei@@ des were sitting at the hel@@ m , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present as she joined the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without tax wife in a row , the first women in the history of British sport that laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their dominance was absolutely , after all its 3@@ 9,@@ made use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athle@@ tics who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not the way of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe . &quot;
&quot; behind any gold in the ruin , a batt@@ ali@@ on is contributing to willing hel@@ pers which make up the difference and it was nobody , but the coach , who would not even survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; he said , he would be risky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and what they did . &quot;
if you do not do that he spreads throughout .
it would have been a rather horrible situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start treatment early 2014 , out of season , could begin what the interruption held to a minimum in case that under such circumstances is the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the seal , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ an morning and tried to talk a little more than usual , and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wr@@ ack . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repeatedly repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no man , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person to play or wish a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
&quot; even over the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark arrived , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very in the moment trapped .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not be able to tear .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not looking out to make something great . &quot;
&quot; we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
this could have been a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years for clear@@ ance of clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ s &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes into retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fresh water @-@ purpose association as a model for the great water producers .
some time ago it meant that some time ago in the original of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Sub@@ fran@@ ken accused the practic@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ s @-@ group was &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this there is Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who held 31 years in its purpose @-@ purpose employees , of which 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was now in retirement in the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ s group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , which spends approximately 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 places and past@@ ors with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the municipalities of the lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ah . &quot;
for more cities and villages there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current chair , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Citiz@@ enship in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was set up as a water tank and was already appointed as of the general manager of the purpose . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water conduc@@ tion and maintenance work on office and organizational skills , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency services on weekends , &quot; said the president . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and initiation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ building of the High Authority ( 1998 ) , the re@@ establishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the divi@@ ders of water lines . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and you have always recorded improvements because water lives and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised idol , reliable and correct service for 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose and he lived in the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he named a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to the Nit@@ rat@@ chet at the Sub@@ forum of Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ add@@ on the one hand Shar@@ es Al@@ f@@ ons Greeks who worked together with him 28 years .
he is the best Wasser@@ eper and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbeatable team .
&quot; as a highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ struc@@ turing of the organization . &quot;
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the tube @-@ break at the high col@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water .
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because you filled the high col@@ der of P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose Association was handed over to Daniel storms made of Lau@@ ter who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and they are fatal .
&quot; the man has called for ourselves and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , according to him it is publicly known . &quot;
&quot; by now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown , brown and has a lat@@ ch . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a couple of years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man carries a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon in itself so the police force .
&quot; who Sven S. sees , is supposed to call the 110 . &quot;
&quot; the police speaks of an &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the victim was from 1988 , the perpetrators of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; in Lü@@ beck , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck wanted no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between offen@@ ders and victims ; but they confirmed that a man was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing . &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick of the German steel industry
the cryp@@ ted explo@@ ded and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains of additional cost in million@@ aires .
&quot; financial strain that threaten the industry from Ö@@ z@@ rom promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains in the liberation from the renewable energy environment in the components to the so @-@ called fitness production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said the &quot; West German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Y , Fri@@ day@@ issue ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot;
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to apply the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ fen to generate electricity for their own consumption , to checkout . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry , the steel industry claims at an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it now publishes a fundamental agreement with the European Commission for talks with competitive commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel plants will be replaced , the case of an EEG re@@ model of 20 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission for the creation of the Commission .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be determined . &quot;
special significance has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the E@@ emissions right are air conditioning and employment targets &quot; , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in Europe , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure . &quot;
last year the situation was further ag@@ grav@@ ated to be the world &apos;s largest terrestrial demand in the face of the weak@@ ening of domestic demand for steel to the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel t@@ attered pricing .
during this spring time the situation has relaxed .
&quot; on the one hand , the import duties on imported steel effect , for the other , the economic prospects have appeared in China . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price of recovery is unclear .
the German industry @-@ pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained cautious on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been st@@ agn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted to shut out the end of individual works as well .
in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6000 people were busy .
&quot; in July the German steel manufacturer remain cautious , despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced more than 3.4 million tonnes of less rough steel than in the previous year , like the economic association of steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity provided for the second month after a short increase in May . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the Association expects an improved order intake with an increasing boost . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing is good . &quot;
&quot; singing has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was at school &apos;s choir , at the teacher &apos;s studies , she finished the fe@@ ach music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a seniors . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample , it feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
&quot; next door , she does something good in her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; for S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior ministry . &quot;
&quot; most of the seniors sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular meetings the elderly are able to establish and maintain social contacts .
&quot; they often solve social and family structures at age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience also has been &quot; UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in her choir &quot; : to speak and organize themselves on the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together .
singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense thinks H@@ ac@@ kler .
because exercising seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly calls his lungs regularly also in everyday life not as fast as the pu@@ ste .
&quot; even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Sen@@ iors organizations . &quot;
&quot; in older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that the singing or hearing of songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often linked to positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; due to Lie@@ d@@ texts and particularly melodies , the ill @-@ sick person with@@ drew herself to a long rec@@ tory events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires a special achievement , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just older people who live alone , practice so , not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the chor@@ us writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : if I do something for something , I become better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he says , little talent to have , betra@@ ying L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t really sings - at 50 sin@@ king people who h@@ ears it , when a sound goes next to it ? &quot;
looking for the appropriate offer have seniors different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sings someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a seniors , you can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer insights on cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir , can turn right to the church or the church . &quot;
many people &apos;s cho@@ irs will also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if anyone has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Inter@@ ne@@ tre@@ cher@@ che . &quot;
&quot; who would desire to sing should necessarily join a chor@@ us , betra@@ ying H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .

bi@@ ologists have examined the effect of the ru@@ ps of kittens on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the Gre@@ ys also didn &apos;t let the males not be cold , but they kept themselves in contrast to the females always alike . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal of kittens am Mi@@ xed the little ones .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster on foli@@ age of kittens , who are interested in great need , such as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School of Hanover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ater also react to the rest of kittens , but always equal . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acousti@@ cal differences between the Gre@@ ys of less and heavily ra@@ gged juven@@ iles for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is first author@@ itarian in the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evolution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens with the urgency of their aid needs .
a total of nine adult boys and eight females from the zo@@ id of the MH@@ H were observed .
they were played for a herd of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the throw @-@ box and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
&quot; for the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ ams of more powerful kittens which have also been up@@ lifted . &quot;
the researchers consider their results despite the small sample of sample for meaningful seed .
&quot; all females , even those who have not had their own offspring , reacted out differently to the cry &quot; , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker when this call@@ ings of the very sublime kittens .
this ability may be or develop or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all , &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in . &quot;
scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in the past several times in the past .
&quot; some studies showed that women have been more sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers , or not , the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey a arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the ru@@ sty soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup trial in Turkey a major football game takes place .
before the Du@@ eling of the Erz@@ ri@@ v@@ alen between visits to Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line un@@ ambiguous : &quot; business as is &quot; is said .
&quot; already in the suspension of the state of emergency , after the upheav@@ al trial in July the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected to join the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
it is not done before football before football .
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office provided an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the fact that now in America it is now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kis@@ r is supposed to be p@@ endant of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is held accountable by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; although it is valid for 90 days in a state of emergency to October , actually this has been in the life of the Turks but as good as no implications . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; democracy &quot; &quot; in public places across the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into trailer and opponent Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club visits are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , but in view of dramatic experience in history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even if the fans agree - no matter if your heart beats up for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or visits .
at Po@@ kal@@ sie@@ ger &quot; Gala &quot; it will arrive especially back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
&quot; his sporting value held the Köl@@ ner in the past season : with 17 gates , and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his organisation . &quot;
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ Sie@@ g@@ bu@@ ffer .
&quot; the paper &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured by his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to Pol@@ di , the disappointing season for the record was a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round tr@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also appeared early in the European League . &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it took only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we managed and this is most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master visits the game was better .
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasonal figures as sw@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ sc@@ orer , made the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in the case of AC , Florence , under contract and on visits , the Gom@@ ez had not been disclosed to the coup in the contract , not to return to the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; club@@ house fibro@@ us Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the falls should be ready to refrain from around one third of his to 7.5 million euros , &quot; Or@@ man said : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence can not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing , these athletes still have medals for Olympics in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
other over@@ led athle@@ tics @-@ sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
&quot; the subject of dop@@ ing , as before the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ ed in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had taken up after a dop@@ ing sper@@ re her Star@@ trecht shortly before playing , was f@@ ished at its start ( 100 meters chest ) bl@@ ended . &quot;
it provided a sk@@ inn@@ y scenario : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and pro@@ voc@@ ed with her performance .
&quot; when fixed , that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ubil@@ ation storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more sports@@ men , who have gone to the start despite dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was imprisoned two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell , the Olympi@@ asi@@ e@@ ger runs from 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion even faster than before , he is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic @-@ singer and si@@ eben@@ fold world in had to sit a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after you detected the intake of pain using ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery you have had strong dental pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended itself . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was tested for the Olympics in 2012 and the European Championship in 2013 and Europ@@ ame@@ ister@@ in from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic possessed the ignorant and was locked six months .
the four far@@ th@@ read@@ ings this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ge ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Olympi@@ e@@ ger and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested and 21 months been locked . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement may have been responsible , beg@@ ged Mer@@ ge . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is about 200 and 400 meters from the fastest growing man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athle@@ te were detected as many medals as well . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on had lost its World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after it was found in it testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille of the Olympic Games in 2008 , he received a part of a part of the International Criminal Tribunal of the CA@@ S International Tribunal . &quot;
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in two of the world rankings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world championship and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin has only been tested in May , but may still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old world Championships , references to the intake of a bot@@ any dietary supplement were found , the sper@@ re of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austria is injured - multiple t@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ . &quot;
&quot; she suffered chi@@ pped and was treated in the hospital , but have already left this time again . &quot;
they planned their home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on , are also affected by Austrian citizens , is not yet unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Department of Foreign Affairs stand in close contact with the local authorities , so S@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at around 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in , were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in an exterior quarter . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , the police were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Netherlands and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; after Friday morning two explo@@ sions went high , and according to the authorities another person was killed . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
at the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach@@ ands Pat@@ ong a taxi driver has been injured by a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , another bom@@ bas@@ kets , which killed an urban fund . &quot;
according to the authorities in a cau@@ be@@ et before the prec@@ inct of the coastal police went into the air according to the authorities .
&quot; after all , de@@ on@@ ations were demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several times . &quot;
&quot; we go out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army @-@ general Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but most likely it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that are typical for the bombing of the bomb mus@@ li@@ ous separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revolt or with the international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one must assume that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - although they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still , the group behind the attacks is unclear . &quot;
&quot; the police pointed its officials all over the country to increase security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amusement quarter . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they are usually not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ anned i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the well @-@ hearted bombar@@ d@@ ment , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends to result in his homepage , the instructions of the Thai safety authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( safety level 3 ) holds true for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ hear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between security guards and Muslim people , no necessary travel will not be removed in these provinces . &quot;
higher security risk ( safety level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday made a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this spati@@ ally influence the military influence also in the coming years .
&quot; he said Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a , the bombs were attempting to stick chaos , while the country moved towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military in@@ ta , which had seized the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces , keeps the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip for years in the extreme south of the country with the rebellion of rebellion . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
a year ago we had been killed in Bangkok with a stop at a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is into the vision of the Federal Constitutional Court for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several state of the country , the Constitu@@ ent Con@@ feder@@ ations have also placed the group under review . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; identity movement &apos; for efforts against the shared democratic principles , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court of Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , Zu@@ w@@ anders will diff@@ use Islamic faith or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
that is why we observe the movement now too .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by es@@ tran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; Constitu@@ ent in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , N@@ RW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the state of the country . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally try extremis@@ ts to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; to Islam@@ ists , as well as right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts . &quot;
this is not a mental advertising for your own thing .
propaganda is supposed to address the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are there in a special way prone .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there have been reports of &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; reports about the contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; of Af@@ d politicians . &quot;
&quot; while Ma@@ ate said , he did not have insights . &quot;
for the Constitutional Protection the possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
&quot; it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the A@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changing their destination , and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; so , it is clear whether such individuals have controlled influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the substantial increase in legal criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said , he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be legitimate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free Group .
&quot; it can be quite that further legitimate groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ right motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or pan @-@ wide control of rec@@ ster@@ r@@ ism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , ma@@ d@@ ined about that many attack on the account of men went that previously did not appear in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the Tatra attacks on asylum arrivals were not known as criminal , politically motivated or tra@@ ilers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed beforehand , which had previously agreed with right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or , for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who have then radic@@ alised by far @-@ right tendencies . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is becoming Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
do not always determine the Olympi@@ as or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave performance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could not be seen at times longer in the TV pictures .
it disappeared simply - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks there was then the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old was finished with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and captured the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ tup . &quot;
&quot; it was , however , rather its not just a sports character that attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old part of the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special set in the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ presented countries well known .
&quot; since in Ethiopia the most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname made the round .
some media identified it as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; bene@@ factor &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ leaf &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made fun on him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he proposed only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ isti@@ l , there played no role . &quot;
compare with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was paying attention to media attention . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of the swimming pool from the Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ isti@@ l . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tic was fired M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i back then .
the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the dro@@ ple@@ ting electoral position not so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential guard Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election event in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already received an alternative . &quot;
then he then drive into the holiday .
&quot; loses Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November , would it be the relatively no matter : &quot; ultimately it will be either cl@@ ap , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; the Candi@@ date of Re@@ public@@ ans said in a telephone interview with the US @-@ television sen@@ ders CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be it right , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance to be formed within his party . &quot;

&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he had said at the end of July . &quot;

GF@@ K leadership happens after dis@@ appoint business figures
the consumer @-@ based company Gf@@ K conf@@ uses his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the resi@@ du@@ es came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K company &apos;s Gf@@ K noted that the Chair of Matthias Hart@@ mann &apos;s chair will be all the more secure , the longer the promised success remain . &quot;

&quot; who will in future be the market research , is not yet unclear . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ ent , it was meant to have been the disappointment on Friday at the shareholders of the continued success of the continued success of years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K top since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each participant will eventually be rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case in BMW , this would also be the Qu@@ and@@ ar , &quot; says it . &quot;

&quot; at an accident of a travel time with 43 seniors and passengers , on Thursday in Krum@@ lov ( county of Aur@@ i ) , eight people have been injured . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their details according to a counter@@ balance , partly on the counter @-@ driving path . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a speaker in the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; because of the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire@@ men liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six life@@ guard and an emergency car came to the accident on the national road 2 .
the un@@ last travellers were brought back by a regular bus to the Krum@@ lov district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators demanded the burden of load and possible witnesses to report to the police . &quot;
&quot; fees per cu@@ bic meters of waste water range from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ schen@@ berg 3.@@ 44 instead of now 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ over 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( until 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will be increased by once again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a sle@@ ek calculation , the waste water in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ scape Kul@@ mb@@ ach that was running for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
the c@@ endorf market is committed to legally based on legal basis to operate the facilities free of charge .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies of worlds , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ lop , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to take deeper into the w@@ allet . &quot;
the fees are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as directors Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , a new circulation of fees for the wast@@ e@@ water supply systems was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , there are also over@@ - or sub@@ missions from the previous calculation period . &quot;
&quot; founded in all three se@@ wage rates , Schmidt started that there are relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wage systems with a very low water @-@ waste water , that lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the small distribution basis , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ e@@ water in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the backward calculation period in all three plants , they were not least due to their age of age and repair expenses in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for cat@@ fish , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ over almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the wast@@ e@@ water Az@@ endorf the mechanical aer@@ ation system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping space , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond position , after nearly 20 years of operation the first Kl@@ är@@ tei@@ ch had to be installed and an additional ventilation system should be installed in order to be able to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the advanced supervis@@ ors and maintenance costs came into account in accordance with the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still under the present level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that at low water fall in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; however , he added Schmidt to have spar@@ ed the market community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above @-@ mentioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious according to stone houses in the long run , especially since you could not extend the area of se@@ wage @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal for these plants because it deals with deficits . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , considered positive 0.@@ 2 % . &quot;
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,@@ 0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) .
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in advance for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as asi@@ atic cartoon
&quot; Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ afe to races . &quot;
&quot; with his filter tool , it allows Sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a character that could be from a Roy Light @-@ painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are unmistak@@ able , stand@@ alone tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ enium per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps are to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past criticism in which they were accused of making the app Black@@ surface @-@ shaped or white skin as a beauty ideal propag@@ ate .
&quot; when this week suggested a filter for some users who gave them sle@@ ep@@ y , false teeth and raised che@@ eks , there are some critics a rac@@ ist caricature of A@@ sians . &quot;
&quot; they asked whether these repeated controversi@@ es were to be a greater problem , that the company with diversity . &quot;
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and mother@@ board , a day after snack chat that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as homage to Ani@@ me characters and not as caricature of A@@ sians .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced se@@ is@@ m@@ atism , the filter is reminded of hur@@ ting stere@@ otypes . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; &quot; vulnerable and mild &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ balance of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ weight , but that the yellow line was drawn to the decreasing extreme . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural Stol@@ beads .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are in the matter of race than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity to be expected .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters is created a picture that is ins@@ ul@@ ting for a user , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u , Zh@@ u , who works as product man@@ ag@@ erin and engineer for the medium to delete her sn@@ ap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she told that she believes that r@@ itting @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in adju@@ sting practice at Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the large part white , only male driving leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , which has largely un@@ answered Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a microphone , the company recently focused on a staff responsible which focuses on sub@@ ordin@@ ated population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said in turn her sn@@ ap@@ chat account is closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot;
&quot; military leadership for@@ f@@ aded ISIS intelligence information , provides the committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military @-@ related information related to the United States Central Command changed in@@ ward information to draw an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the spot , it mel@@ ted an investigation committee of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ que kom@@ mit@@ es , Secret Services , and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ter report , reported by great dis@@ content among Central Command secret service analy@@ zer , which changed their assessments under the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news @-@ service information , which were typically used by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren , marked regularly a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com , is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses will be presented our political leaders , &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management flaw in Cent@@ Com are up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to that government tips given under Obama instructions to change the reports , it shows how analy@@ st faced the pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com An@@ no@@ bility was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of members of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command have changed the retro@@ spect reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans were calling the Task Force into life after they were awarded that analysts are concerned with the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings , while the investigation will be continued . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the General Government of Defense Department . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the intelligence agencies published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years of 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for drawing up @-@ to @-@ date assessments under IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest ranking democr@@ at in the com@@ mons , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ as , &quot; delayed the publication of &quot; &quot; reports &quot; , &quot; the morality of the analysts and &quot; gave some little room for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence of an intervention in the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st as regards a &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ators due to the general manager of the Pentagon , who were admitted to complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Mr. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on Congress during the investigation of the general meeting . &quot;
&quot; but he also assumed that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
&quot; the investigations have returned from the question of a successful aviation campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Defense Department ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest adjustment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recall that more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , the recommendations of many analysts looked forward to a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting on Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team at Mr. Hoo@@ ker set out a significant impact on government agencies held against the Islamic State , since this pro@@ vision@@ ing refin@@ eries had taken into operation since this pro@@ vision@@ ing refin@@ eries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this realization was however not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legis@@ lature because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women ; a show@@ down with the UK stands before
&quot; one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victories over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they cannot remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; this , however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are still in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place that remain un@@ beaten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first lap .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which both of them will gain first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer in the strong hol@@ s who lead the other group .
&quot; as usual , the game may occur on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story , four years after they landed at last London games in the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time in three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because it could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then the year 2012 came in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the subsequent year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , the coach of the National Team , and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a body transition , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work record in London that we have now .
we have been able to tear the Ru@@ der completely around .
on Thurs@@ days B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the clos@@ eup .
&quot; India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the playing hall from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until they took their hands in their hands . &quot;
&quot; she did a Spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left side , then moved into the middle and swal@@ lowed the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like construction .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline , &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro make a steady and ines@@ capable of a rapid run between competition and quest . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself is a burning off , that is passed from bracel@@ ets to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn off the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop , without the Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ af@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s hot with di@@ m@@ ples could have been well @-@ known among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and wellness @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner , or even Fe@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not lit up any event equal .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow there are the sports that are not generally recognized : air brush , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may have long reign .
&quot; but if I might make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been debut in Sydney , it became the last 16 years as spar@@ se that many that , I interviewed , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in a trampoline , and until 2012 had an athle@@ te that made it until the end of the final . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans that share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds for un@@ enligh@@ tened ear pass@@ able for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a few enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end cloud t@@ len@@ ders - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that unites it essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , sl@@ ums and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ as , you will be evaluated according to the execution , difficulty of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other . &quot;
the non @-@ sam@@ pled olymp@@ ic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ers hoping to go upward in their pursuit of gold , faster , upward and above , sometimes down to the finish , sometimes back and back , to the top and down the playground . &quot;
&quot; they chase not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but also a further under@@ mining target : the world or the Olympi@@ are@@ kor@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the targeted pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I don &apos;t want to look at the list@@ ings of these games as something .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward @-@ forward movement is not the target .
&quot; he or she pr@@ t from , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down , then effortlessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a firm@@ ament in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abolition of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s just as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will beam the ends as part of a afternoon on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil . &quot;
&quot; if the consciousness levels can only be achieved through the anxiety and the lens of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting His longing for air rin@@ sing , new fan@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia spread to violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that tens were killed during clas@@ hes with the police in sc@@ uss@@ sion .
is Ethiopia just to break up ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the past few months , protests against the government of the country and are moving in more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people walked down to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses put witnesses that poli@@ c@@ emen were shot on tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; moving videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safe people strike young people with st@@ aves , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough examination .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold up this country and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ians economy expanded at the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ulum in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , with dis@@ sident effective to be sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you sup@@ press people and do not have other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in the central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
all the youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
&quot; there are numerous ail@@ ments , which cover all from the soil use to the spice in relation to power of the ruling coalition . &quot;
&quot; after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the tensions stop along the border to Eritrea ; a struggle for these jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ ga@@ des , who were forced to use turmoil and re@@ ar@@ ming the turbul@@ ence in recent years . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of stretching out before themselves slo@@ ping under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via the social media , as bil@@ lig@@ ently smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government sees access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing at regular intervals , especially for protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies which conce@@ al where they can stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians tried to gather themselves so too prot@@ ectors .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since the times prosp@@ eri@@ zed the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia in predominantly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and the economy while the Oro@@ mos are exploited , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are involved in coordinating under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests were held in areas of the am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which constitute approximately 6 percent of the population , which are dominant in the military service , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the unrest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years as Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think about fac@@ ets . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly con@@ den@@ sed in it to perceive early signs of dis@@ cont@@ entment as well as special officers to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively un@@ sigh@@ tly reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiop@@ ians , Mr Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he enjoys not the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested , according to allegations of analy@@ st apparently rejected by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; while the following swe@@ eps were killed many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts , Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , as well as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of internal abnorm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ ested in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ischen city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ ym flights over the neighboring Somalia , although they recently ended that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West definitely wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally collap@@ sing in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin breath . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama gave ISIS &apos; Sar@@ kas@@ m &apos; .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to all@@ ay the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by giving his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State of the Islamic State .
it clari@@ fying these clari@@ fying questions about the communication capabilities of the Re@@ public@@ ans of the Re@@ public@@ ans whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public .
&quot; it also brings his collaborators who make every effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain the actual position , statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump did return to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning t@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation perfectly seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to weaken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republi@@ can presidential guard wanted nothing of it . &quot;
the final storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down on Mr. Tr@@ ump when he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling transformations to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton had speeches on the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump was trying to return to this subject again . &quot;
he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism as he thought , the Russians should crack Mrs. Clin@@ t E@@ mails , but later he said &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the linguistic borders in politics and then return after demand .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans will proceed as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe , he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ use the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an even older idea since its survey values went further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with a big lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative comments , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he &apos;s ampli@@ fied the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal collaborators into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps of prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; in this sense it is true that Obama ISIS is an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most Mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans attempt to argue that the government officially served by Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an Secretary of Foreign Minister , it is permitted to exclude himself by taking the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump put his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them to ride on each of his words and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; poor , &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot;
some of the Democrats offered over Mr. Tr@@ umps ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
&quot; once more across the price of the market , cafe comes back in Green@@ point . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a pe@@ eled café in Williamsburg , in which one could only pay a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years in good coffee . &quot;
of course the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front has been displaced .
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replaced by b in the summer of 2014 , sells Sei@@ fe in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people saw it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ stain wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is change , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is also always good .
&quot; the new owner of the ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time member of the old café , the owner and the general manager of the new café . &quot;
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; as he offered a customer to provide cash resources for a new out@@ going record , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , be@@ held many things . &quot;
Ver@@ b used the same Distri@@ but@@ or for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same lamps out of the old ver@@ b .
&quot; but Rodri@@ guez said , that he also wanted to experiment . &quot;
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu is sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural sha@@ fts .
&quot; the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh juice . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez said , that he noticed a steady stream of old tribal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pus@@ hes through prizes from Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was one such customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way out . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee sink , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that it was on coffee and in the culture in the Ver@@ b , who liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea in this day instead of their usual I@@ ced tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing customer since the beginning of the contract in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered inevitably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and pick up new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he switches his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he does not say Gro@@ ll about it that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to make a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offering , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the Café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has imagined to make them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has more advantages .
an ör@@ t@@ ful saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee in the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was Chief Apostle , saying that he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bet@@ ter@@ ment of the Lok@@ um and the Best@@ ellen got a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell this , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt and his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined DEL@@ ik@@ at@@ essen the Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was a little modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane goat . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans to eat as they eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both the food histori@@ ography .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted from the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while goat in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American cuisine while Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ apped snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the 1929 crash crash . &quot;
&quot; goat , 54 , ordered a virgin olive tree with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; ordered as the repor@@ ters Hack@@ br@@ aten , this found the pair for discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut , liver cheese , and Boh@@ nen@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were made of an ingredient and a slightly cheaper that attracts the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E sm@@ ir@@ ks .
&quot; it must have put themselves in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was placed in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
teams of women co@@ iled for male field work and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; draws the ways with which the country was converted , no longer the land of the land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , tense subject , &quot; appe@@ aled Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new budget so@@ wn : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and cas@@ ser@@ tions were recovered to stap@@ le foods , the cas@@ ser@@ s as &quot; wonderful kind , eating remains @-@ confidence , &quot; noted goat , as cooks have been hidden among a creative sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying .
&quot; meat , which was at the heart of the American cuisine , has become a rarely ser@@ fourth luxury . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely mixed compounds have been tried , since a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which includes recipes , set a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zie@@ gel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , household economics - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country like . &quot;
&quot; by published their recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform paste like cre@@ amy sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical treats . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ Essen . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant cuisine of his kitchen , he spec@@ ulate like the millions on the heavy man of the world , to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost dec@@ il@@ ant menu and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delightful to realistic .
&quot; President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute with his stomach to stat@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book that was described by a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the best prepared to prepare . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said to kill , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave better understood the eating habits of Zie@@ gel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law in the writing of the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Zie@@ gel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ one .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s off , they removed and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pf@@ lau@@ men@@ ue , the President Roosevelt had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , humble recipes to miss a name . &quot;
&quot; there was no shar@@ pen@@ ed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
everyone emerged slightly reluc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it did not tasted bad .
CO@@ E won three times a night .
&quot; like an Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ fier , he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ led everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died at a Fass@@ bom@@ bed attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which has so far been saved about 6@@ 0.000 people according to image newspaper . &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own lives in the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to help the first help in the war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilians who shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians about shining symbols in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; however , as a hero , he never seen himself , said loud picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar fell to the victim &apos;s attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have rejected four vene@@ ers above the Alzheimer adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the S@@ anna
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie got only with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; leis@@ urely swi@@ ms the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k at the bottom of the North Atlantic along the north , in an hour it is just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes up , the five metre long animal acceler@@ ates at s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a ro@@ b . &quot;
this long @-@ way life @-@ co@@ ined lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age .
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means for cycl@@ ones a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already anticip@@ ates that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are st@@ ony . &quot;
only l@@ acked the evidence .
&quot; Greenland are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
&quot; about the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know accordingly little . &quot;
her tempor@@ al @-@ emp@@ o measure her when they set up six animals with a transm@@ itter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
&quot; loot do these shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a ro@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly chase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rolling at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for Kad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water layers down . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues looked at 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ y the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic Ocean .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , during the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the lens of shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it were later no longer re@@ done . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ eup .
&quot; therefore , her birth should lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons attempts to drag larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; with 220 cen@@ tim@@ etres in length of the third smallest animal , the lin@@ sen@@ ders contained a small surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for an 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ etres long Greenland an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record Ha@@ i can be aged with 50@@ 2 centimeters even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females get back then , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign a age to the length . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters , probably on the cus@@ p to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland can obviously have at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
even this is likely to be the world @-@ ch@@ ord for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland @-@ whale , located in its bac@@ on at the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ ke lace , was captured before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the body of the living animals often runs on savings . &quot;
they mature thus later - and aging .
&quot; to keep hot water in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal gets heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on focusing as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a very big animal should invest its resources more in a long life . &quot;
construction ground in the double pack
&quot; with topics relating to building construction , the community at the latest meeting has been focused in the most recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief the panel took the message from Mayor Robert P@@ utz to that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the youngest dwellings can be started . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ ing and closure issues have been clarified and the applications could be made for measurement , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; road l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße ( section 1 ) to interested parties nothing more in the way . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ pe@@ at is convinced that the construction phases in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au , young families and for@@ ested seniors alike . &quot;
&quot; as the name was said , Bau@@ wil@@ der is able to report immediately in town hall , the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els is expected to advise the council in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also send requests to the settlement of other commercial enterprises , coupled with the creation of jobs , to be able to occur , decided to change the community @-@ use plan in part @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of sub @-@ time , it is already designated as a designated industrial zone in order to extend two par@@ c@@ els towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the City of the Main Event was in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to reloc@@ ate jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries , Head of Excellence financial markets and real estate markets of I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money stores will continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass they have given them the approval in the UK so far .
this is exactly the use of big US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects a total of 10000 new jobs in the Main and five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the main banks of the Eurozone , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have held its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg there have been a big fund commercial industry , but just like Dublin in the infrastructure worse off . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the great airport .
&quot; further , the city with slightly available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Seine , the rents for premium business properties are also 50 per cent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life as competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer the city stands on position seven , Luxembourg to position 19 , Dublin in 3rd place and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ di@@ lec@@ tions : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; ref@@ uses the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the correlation of forces : in London , in accordance with figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 people . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs in the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a US office decided that Gilead Sciences is entitled to a refund of the legal costs , which have emerged from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June , Gilead was released from a claim payment in the amount of $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including the opinion of and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the law@@ suit filed in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree of costs , which have ar@@ isen during the defence of the fur . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to move with Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck received each other def@@ endants and property on laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; by the USA , troops supported that they have re@@ conquered full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;

&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton has released its tax return for 2015 , which revealed a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million for the presidential and her husband , an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former Secretary of Bill Clinton had an income of USD 3 million from the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office at the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton Candi@@ date for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his controller of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ics Kamp@@ ag@@ ar hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri announced in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ass contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind wrong exc@@ uses and back@@ ups in terms of his previous promises to publish his taxes . &quot;
it is common for US presidential candidate to publish their tax releases , although it is not obliged by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York &apos;s business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated as a reason for his denial of tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ton &apos;s election hel@@ fer@@ in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Sonder@@ advisor , to CN@@ N that he would not allow tr@@ ump to release something before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; umps critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential elections of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already been vo@@ ci@@ ble that his ref@@ usal questions relate to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its business@@ men and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already cras@@ hed on the subject and released a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ level Re@@ public@@ ans Tr@@ ump for@@ ge his tax return . &quot;
on Thursday she spoke on the subject even during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
he refused to do what has done any other presidential programme during the last decades and to release its tax releases . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very few taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax fraud and tax consultants , the details that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal control are led to an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure that individuals earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here to exchange Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to share their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ets said , he was also subjected to a tax check of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; prior to voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ ton campaign launched a tax return until the year 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ ics , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the control of the Clin@@ ics of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income as wage wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main funds was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ funds , from which the Clin@@ ics dividends and revenues of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;

&quot; condoms with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works councils and promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as eleph@@ ants &quot;
&quot; natur@@ al@@ ers in Tanzania will use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from living settlements - they throw condoms on them , which are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already intensified the idea for years ago by using volunteers in villages in Northern Tanzania , a non @-@ violent @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without having to inj@@ ure animals . &quot;
previously many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is Welt@@ ele@@ th@@ ant@@ ent@@ ag dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we could observe within this con@@ gregations a change of their attitude , with much more confidence that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the elephant by Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighted of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; when it is not sh@@ iel@@ ded , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire @-@ kn@@ oll in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ig@@ nition will only be turned . &quot;
&quot; when it is lighted , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a kno@@ b , and spray fine dust to chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ds into the air . &quot;
a hint is usually already made to chase the elephant .
&quot; one last chance is an adverti@@ ser , which sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ works into the air and thereby causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

&quot; Jewish director , Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch , after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli demonstration since it had requested Arab guests according to an employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; had his trouble in the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the site list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call centre . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; seen him , &quot; &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , del@@ etes in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the designated by Lan@@ z@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ commerce , called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; the fact that this is worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater shame . &quot;
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident broke a rather big resonance in the Internet , in which people called the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
some covered the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel that there would have been given the alleged Re@@ for@@ tification Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed of you , called it in another post , in which it was advised that the hotel , which is located on the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident , &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; apologi@@ ze &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; Israel did not enter into the fast @-@ hand list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung adopted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Tehran in the year round about 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian businesses grew strongly in the country , shared the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies assume existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; the down@@ turn has been reached by deliveries of machines , land @-@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian Foreign Policy gave some 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , of Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which affects the economy of Russia in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record pay ir@@ an@@ dic tourists in Russia last year , broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the Ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I can recommend the visit of the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received Mon@@ uments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the door of mercy
the Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the pond @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were dealt with .
&quot; to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ ess@@ ays of all Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in the last two years , the Ober@@ min@@ is@@ tran@@ ten@@ ary round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgrimage targets was tested and decided finally for the bishops of Freiburg , where this year , at the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , which opened a special pilgrimage goal at this occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and hal@@ ves went on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and distributed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , I drove by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er &apos;s wife is standing and so the pilgrimage was stopped by the Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual tag@@ est@@ our@@ es were converted in the morning and evening depending on a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and writers . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on Feld@@ kreu@@ zen , chap@@ els or churches over again and again r@@ ast to sing together a song from especi@@ al pilgri@@ m Lie@@ d@@ he@@ ft . &quot;

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hed to home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening in the male team Spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ ker@@ chief governor , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y himself . the hunter and made the legend proud , when he rus@@ hed to home to ch@@ ap a win of the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ rams .
&quot; she repeated the trick , after they pick up in March at the railway @-@ world Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
ho@@ ys retirement created a gap , the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close . &quot;
Sk@@ inner was the man who stayed with her when they saw the potential in the ch@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y @-@ winning - and Sk@@ inner put a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord in the qualifying round , but in the stand@@ ings winning the New Zealand won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; upon his lap , I was back shortly after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , when I went in a higher gear to slow down it and allow Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert from and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they went to the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we have master@@ ed a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the site of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there was Hin@@ der that he fell to the train after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Rival .
with such an excessive victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; said , &quot; &quot; It feels the whole UK flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot;
in the last three months we have come together as a team .
&quot; we came so badly with so many world titles that it was amazing to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which have been won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer for our progress in the past five months , we are waiting for a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
with the shape Kenn@@ y it is repeated in the range of possible that he repeated Ho@@ &apos;s &apos;s victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
&quot; that would be born for Kenn@@ y - the exact 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - an explo@@ iting of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese of the Ho@@ y equal .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lonely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two other gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest power in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 in the target .
&quot; the record , which won in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , while the Wig@@ gins will be focused on safety . &quot;
&quot; he had disputed himself yesterday with the qualifications before the qualification , when he called its function@@ aries to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continues and finished , Jo@@ anna Row@@ y S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world premiere period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team is leaving for its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and catch a sh@@ ar of medals .
&quot; following a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were driven . &quot;
&quot; Dr@@ amas played in the background , so the withdrawal of the technical Leit@@ er Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April among sex@@ ism and har@@ ass@@ ing@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ o@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , who has reached its climax at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the mel@@ ting from Portland due to the abolition of energy consumption
&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ tdown of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the plant operator will announce the energy supplier contract , and thus all supply contracts will be lifted up , like the supplier &apos;s energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years is scheduled for 20 years running in November .
&quot; up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland are at stake . &quot;
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to Domin@@ ic effects as the mel@@ tdown has consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the long @-@ term speculation in the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ ali dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which combines the large aluminum mel@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L is that the plant continues to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity by sh@@ mel@@ ting means , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the agreements were called &quot; &quot; secure transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot;
the Treaties have a 12 month period of notice so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L is assuming that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the stream@@ line . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L proceeds from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminology prices for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of contracts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; expectation of a cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... the mel@@ tdown to operate or provide the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even though it is still a statement , why it came back from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the poor economic relations of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland s@@ mel@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland consume around 600 Mega@@ watt and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more of a visual tape than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling stock 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his co@@ ver@@ stars will be so long @-@ awaited that in the last two years pictures of the German magazine are still le@@ ak@@ ted before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already at the cover , cover Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebrities , the Mod@@ els &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , the celebrities &quot; are on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ Brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as &quot; &quot; break@@ through@@ s &quot; &quot; of her generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celebrities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or young people of today who know how to rot@@ ate a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if all of that is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
&quot; once published on the last cover , the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade had one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , Jen@@ ners do not like success to everyone . &quot;
with their Reality @-@ TV story the Jena &apos;s position in the fashion world was always tense .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called &quot; the M@@ ist@@ pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings aw@@ ed again highly as the message with the show Jen@@ ners arrived at the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ grace , it seems to pass by the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer from E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell you pictures of her on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her paintings by Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ler &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; similarities centers present annually 16@@ ,000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ ,000 of the aid boxes of the country are reported annually by the council centers , while the industry has already taken over the effects of further intermediate cuts in already over@@ due transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , there are already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ sts and a similar interest in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already moder@@ ately loaded , make up for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , the legal centers of further 30 percent of their federal government will be lost . &quot;
&quot; the director of the municipal council centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell told that the last survey of the National Association of Joint Action centers , revealed that thousands of people will be rejected every year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell told that the situation would only be worse without abol@@ ishing the federal government . &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ bor@@ dering centers are chron@@ ically supported , which means thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ ur@@ able and pressing debt , families who were released by separ@@ ations , workers who have problems of a legal manner - all these people have problems of a legal manner and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut off the funding by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of helpful people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we demand the General Federal Minister for General Ad@@ voc@@ ative and Federal Minister of Queensland , as well as sen@@ ators from Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these intermediate cuts , so people need the help they need to be given in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the national government fulfilled their commitment to up@@ lift funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customer communities , and that the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump campaign campaign charged with employees allegedly weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign was charged with an in@@ action after her was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina was directed to an employee , while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in a indictment that was submitted on Wednesday in the Local Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave to , for months to have waited , that the matter would be regulated internally before it re@@ alises that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;

&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave to . &quot;
&quot; the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential guard took a turmoil , when he said to a crowd of men in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment &quot; &quot; - black@@ weapons and weapons @-@ lovers should take action , if its Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge should appoint . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ umps campaign made clear that the media would have ri@@ pped out his words from the context , and that he would not viol@@ ate the violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of duty of duty and by Philip for bodily injury and ab@@ iding spiritual damage . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on Länder @-@ election : SPD and CD@@ U lose
significant losses for the ruling parties in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) are characterised by significant losses for the ruling parties and CD@@ U .
this took representative surveys of the opinion research scientist IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; -@@ Newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government pre@@ dominant in the north could not be governed , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have great opportunities to remain the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD increased by 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago at 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party itself had only just under the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) , the Greens have returned to the heav@@ en@@ ary day of the country . &quot;
&quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP have not been represented by 3 percent , each with 3 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives the SPD proposed by the survey , according to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
&quot; they blasph@@ eme the green with 19 percent higher than 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would miss the train in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market .
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost a half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and larger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was in the beginning eight Me@@ gab@@ ytes , which would range today for about two sel@@ enium with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ yte in the meantime .
&quot; Nokia 9@@ ,000 communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 to the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet era . &quot;
but 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously at the Ce@@ BIT in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; office in the Western Europe format &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot : SMS and E @-@ Mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser if also agon@@ izing slowly .
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be checked like a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found themselves .
&quot; rather proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
no @-@ one could see in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile Spar@@ te of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and executed . &quot;
&quot; today , providers are master suppliers that came all of them later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; ever and everywhere online , this is a lot of people today . &quot;
2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; around 1.4 billion units sold , Samsung and Apple have been sold to a total of 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running transactions of the countless app provider and telecommunications companies are coming up . &quot;
around the smartphone has now emerged as a whole industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was just beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple @-@ Chief Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three equipment in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet @-@ communication , everything per touch @-@ screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the victory of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had to see . &quot;
&quot; after all , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the seeds now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
&quot; in the cut , every German now sees 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we must learn to learn the smartphone also , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens @-@ Management Board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the olymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw is not only born in our local community and in London , but throughout the country of renovation and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , it presented the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , as at that time in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local people and firms near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities we will be able to create 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment at the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of enlar@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ ating on the world stage .
the two @-@ por@@ ters had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every given question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment to the airport as well as in the whole UK . &quot;
&quot; we have achieved a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the T@@ 2 to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequency @-@ test tre@@ ad in the world . &quot;
&quot; now , they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
&quot; it is time that we will direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw , and thereby creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; &quot; with regard to advertising block &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online income , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to deal with ad block@@ ade , a &quot; &quot; k@@ atz@@ - and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would ad signs on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gging page , in which it hur@@ ried that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page was to change the enco@@ ding concerning his advertisements , in order to adver@@ sely affect the detection on which part of the page advertising is to make it difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ gger post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the an@@ zei@@ ent Open Source Community and the Shift has already been underway since the invention of scor@@ geb@@ entic@@ ements is underway , and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the struggle for social media in the struggle , is a strong indication of how worrying indicators has become the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people , please have almost four times so much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , who access Facebook through their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ en@@ bung makes 84 percent of the income of Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has an ad lock on desktop PCs , apart from the mobile ad block , it does not have an effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of income from giving Facebook the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it was to update his &quot; &quot; ad prize pool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said that there would be no more control of new filters because they would also block the content on the page , which are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a speaker by Facebook in an email notification . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt remedy , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected self @-@ su@@ icide over Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman in the early morning on Thursday at an suspected self @-@ su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the Dark Ones in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a welding at the age of 49 years , consisting of several vehicles , including a truck , was over to kill themselves . &quot;
it still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , but some are still not identified , the police , who asked this as well as every witness of the pre@@ case to report to them . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; log@@ istical &quot; step in such a situation , he shared Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers are not going to be held accountable .
&quot; in any of the two cases , where a person ran on the highway on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ists must not assume that a pedest@@ rians run in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a poli@@ c@@ ist of the prop@@ elled kill@@ ings was acqu@@ itted , after having over@@ ride a man and killed that in August 2014 a night on the A1 was near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street , and took the court . &quot;
&quot; the Court ruled that the poli@@ cem@@ an -- which had responded to an emergency call -- on an justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
Venus was probably once li@@ vable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms which resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have been recorded with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once a similar circumstances . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ ved atmosphere , and yet slowly revol@@ ved . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect even faster . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow ren@@ dition of Venus passes their day side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ med the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer clouds , which appears like an umbrella , to cut the surface from a large part of the sun@@ flower . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today . &quot;
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution of evolution that was previously thought of planetary research .
&quot; although it was probably inhabited , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ has been exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was blown away by the ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen there only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- Venus which as we know it today .
the researchers shared the findings of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy enters the trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and introduced a small contribution to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the past three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy has expressed in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization &apos;s organisation . &quot;
he must also have a determination right in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who presented Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; said Z@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the winner of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the best coach of the league .
&quot; he carried out the club on 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten and missed in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs in the first round of the season . &quot;
the description recorded in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second game spot in the Western Conference for five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ler resume talks on putting strikes
&quot; the struggles with regard to the compensation for North @-@ sea @-@ oil workers are exposed , while all armed forces are put together for a new conversation round at the table , they said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strike against oil field service providers Wood Workers have been spor@@ adic@@ ally performed on platforms in the North Sea that is operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting the beginning next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage rates of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has shortened its ranks to its contra@@ indications in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the advice of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company has the required space to get through market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alized its business activities as a result of his me@@ ch@@ atting with British energy companies BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are due to lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that is reinforced by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week , to discuss one of the largest work in the North Sea , which has been taking place for a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion euros will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rates of stars in the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the newest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ tel@@ es@@ coping has helped the most recent catalogue on Rot@@ ation rates among the stars of the star @-@ raising of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star @-@ pile are rotating at different rings , as well as in which context the rotation @-@ periods have been developed with the planetary development . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experience through the comparisons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ tup of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years of the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which were created above 125 million years ago , are now reaching the adult . &quot;
you are now turning the fastest .
these gri@@ pping stars come across large amounts of star@@ ches .
&quot; as this winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a bre@@ wed effect on the stars . &quot;
when a star is aged , his rot@@ ational @-@ rate begins to slow down . &quot;
&quot; Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each of the star , by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star , such as sun@@ spots . &quot;
the latest catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates indicate that massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compares the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower stri@@ ls than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas serious rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideological laboratory to compare the qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ tup of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; there is still much more to learn about what we want to know more about how , when , W@@ ann and Why stars make their rotation rates down and speak their &quot; dance shoes &quot; to say . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades which will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Baseball @-@ Star occurs
the tears started with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball @-@ star in best days of base .
&quot; after its emotional set @-@ up announcement , the 41 years old pro will be held at the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays last time the Tri@@ bo@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say to &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ star participants of the Major League Baseball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected by the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series . &quot;

&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , weights may not start from Poland in Rio in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a wis@@ h@@ ful athle@@ te would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day the first official dop@@ ing cases became known in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; the Chinese swimming pond in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacles of Bulgaria and the Polish weights of Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski were well tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions , these news come to the un@@ time . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en , the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de had been proven last Sunday , which is used as a masculine instrument for dop@@ ing instances . &quot;
the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon on the outskirts of the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old was occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze statue . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the procedures over 50 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample with the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) for the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; the National Association take the issue &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation among the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ itation of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio sick@@ ened the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is intended to act with the bot@@ any substance around the EP@@ O &apos;s blood @-@ offering . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been em@@ bell@@ ished , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial should also be positive . &quot;
&quot; Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov , immediately expressed himself with criticism of the Ath@@ ena . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we Bulgarian are standing under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , approximately all the weight of the chron@@ icle of the chron@@ ically weigh@@ ted nation may not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case of &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; , &quot; the London @-@ Olympi@@ e@@ ger in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the entire Russian team led the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing the start , even the L@@ ists in Kenya produces many bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the former associations in China had also taken care of fierce conflicts between athletes . &quot;
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ e@@ ger Sun Yang har@@ sh@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 metres of Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun was positively tested with the Chinese champi@@ onships positive to the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ ma@@ ses h@@ oot its ran@@ som
programmers of In@@ press@@ ing @-@ mal@@ ware currently rely targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the mal@@ ware specialists , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , at 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partly several victims of an attack with black@@ mailing software . &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
&quot; 40 percent of the victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators demanded , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot;
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their black@@ ma@@ ges software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes and attacks on attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially press release ran@@ som clearly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we watch currently a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the damage , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetrators discovered Er@@ press@@ ing software for themselves .
&quot; only , private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks occurred in the past few months quickly . &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , they specifically search for un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ cloud , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encrypted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ mailing .
&quot; to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ing Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where in private users the personal Photo database is on the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly higher the damage falls , if a ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German firms affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business operations , in one case people were aware of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health care . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you only promote the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ator in the operation of a stand@@ still . &quot;
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety scientists of F @-@ Secure the beneficiaries have examined and come into contact with the black@@ outs and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money .
&quot; they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or en@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and will redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must be partly tough and five @-@ digit sums have to return to their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , the safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the Anti@@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software building on the actual black@@ outs .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ins then seek more h@@ ackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log into one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminals and instruc@@ ts another way to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ fier calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually over@@ sees the criminals then sp@@ ammer of the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known in many companies that can secure their data better .
&quot; over 50 percent of the companies @-@ IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey , trust in order to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scans . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have a sufficient threat to successful testing more , the perpetrators instead , with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the potential for damages , according to the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators would be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
at the Hack@@ ney Conference Def@@ con demonstrated the safety researchers as they could get one with the internet inter@@ connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block heating could be quite worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetrators rather than the heating in future block a whole production way in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware might be a subject in industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda , Honda wants to pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be actually extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first series as well as in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls into something . &quot;
versatile vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ set and 10@@ 26 l with ren@@ amed back , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , as it sounds : the seats of the back@@ bank can be rot@@ ated like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceiling of 1.@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be easily loaded , however the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the currently tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds the HR @-@ V thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation segments , very powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , he is likely to do something more qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; the everyday consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging . &quot;
there is still another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
&quot; the equipment can be found in the &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; in the tested top version &quot; Executive . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the security systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assistant is at speeds up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions @-@ system and the spi@@ der assistant . &quot;

&quot; however , the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat awk@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
&quot; those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline iner from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 exhaust system .

Air@@ line is not liable for over@@ throwing in passenger bridge
an air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a password on the passenger bridge .

&quot; however , the accident could not happen everywhere - it can be a general risk of life , such as judgment . &quot;
the airline had no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
&quot; after their journey , holiday@@ makers get only money back when the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ lessly found in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the tra@@ ded case , a family on the second day of their Turkish lau@@ bs was heavily affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
it spent almost the whole vacation in the room .
&quot; their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a faul@@ ty se@@ wage plant , which supposedly attacked the sea@@ water . &quot;
the family was the view that the trip had been faul@@ ty - and mour@@ ned against the Organ@@ izer .
&quot; in court , the applicant had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the se@@ wage plant was defective . &quot;
but the organizer took only just before departure of the applicant .
he had to assume that sea water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his information duties , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of the water no contam@@ in@@ ants have been found .
&quot; the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps by infection , belonging to each other - belonging to the general life risk . &quot;
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 sick .
&quot; Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , according to the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were concerned about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be denied and decided to respond to terror at the same time .
sure : our country will not answer the perpetrators of the perpetr@@ ator with hate and division .
we will not give this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders had to leave the country more quickly , this is high level of security and also the consent of the people for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to reach a implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ elle strengthening of security forces , and in the middle of medium size order over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the arms is not so re@@ marked , that above all the purchase of weapons is generated in the internet . &quot;
the most recently discussed welding for doctors is to be maintained after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions as the threat of the citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of mental abnorm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to counter@@ act a radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social support for the necessary basis . &quot;
teachers had to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
&quot; to pro@@ secu@@ te crimin@@ alisation in special areas of the internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of this investig@@ ator . &quot;
SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Interior is clearly opposed to shareholders . &quot;
&quot; this was a ear@@ nest for the Shar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ af@@ er ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double citizenship before .
a general ban on the enforcement of enforcement is un@@ constitutional problems .
&quot; one cannot for@@ bid everything you re@@ jects , and I refuse the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; talking about rules about road traffic , or for witnesses before the court . &quot;
&quot; green @-@ leader Simone Peter threw the Minister before , he wants to sim@@ ulate with ever new anti @-@ terror pact . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party manager Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Spr@@ int and a tigh@@ tening of the common law bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better traffic @-@ flow on the motorway fl@@ inger
it is on a regular basis on the road @-@ road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal entity will be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all passenger car enthusiasts , who are in traffic on the ambient road every night in the St@@ au , when it comes across the motorway ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the road building is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 . August ) in the area between the hammer street and the departure Wes@@ eler street the right @-@ wing track at 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then be right from the hammer street on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic shares at the early age , thus reducing the overall effect on the multi @-@ prop@@ elled section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U @-@ group in the district of the Federal Republic of Münster @-@ West .
&quot; the passenger name on the Zu@@ br@@ inger was nervous , above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot;
on week@@ days the return from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
&quot; for this reason , the needle t@@ hr is on the B 51 just before the departure of Wes@@ eler Street . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic will only be guided via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second trace had to be re @-@ built almost in a three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge does not have the required hydro@@ electric power to absorb , especially to heavy duty traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated stat@@ au will last , the responsible country is not able to say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is possible to calculate with years : for the bridge has an official remaining duration up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the law , the country has deliberately picked the traffic more vulnerable time in the school holidays because with disabilities to reck@@ on . &quot;
the traffic will be guided on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the site .
intercultural journey : cultural activities for schools
the international class of forest school visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the N@@ IMA &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the boy The@@ theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ IMA &apos;s &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; &quot; 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years attended the staging of the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes have the opportunity to visit within the framework of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphies , the cens@@ or images and video animations have been possible to follow the course of action , the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ IMA &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Language , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music @-@ training project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will get the opportunity to visit professional guided tours in the areas of singing , dance , spectacle and music . &quot;

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you are walking forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning there is no more to think of sleep in the morning . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do you speak sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there can be many causes underlying , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , Managing Director of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ gery and sleeping medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you fully understand , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an input and a sle@@ ep@@ y . &quot;
&quot; just that can sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Managing Director at the German home medical association with practice in the lower @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can organic , mental or dil@@ uted factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
not rare is the no@@ vice expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early waking up is common especially in depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors print each other .
&quot; for example , who has a sli@@ pped disk , can lie badly , guarded all two to three hours and star@@ red on , about everyday problems and worry , gives We@@ e@@ ß an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who is not well located over a period of one month in a minimum of three nights per week and is imp@@ aired by the day , should go to the physician , betra@@ ying . &quot;
&quot; impairment may look quite different : it is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has voting fluctu@@ ations or bodily discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to relie@@ ve the sleeping disorder , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things are behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping @-@ coated only in exceptional cases and a maximum for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , N@@ go Fi@@ etze has hardly been emphasized in Germany , Professor In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should contact the physician first at bed@@ time , betra@@ ying We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
he can clarify the problems whether the problems have a physical cause .
who was to sleep in the sleeping laboratory and what happens there ?
&quot; to investigate in sleeping laboratory , medicine for example with snoring with respiratory infections , in sickness @-@ day @-@ fatigue , in sleeping , or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder . &quot;
you do not have to prepare for the investigation .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after c@@ ab one goes to his normal time in bed .
&quot; besides the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a nose @-@ wearing , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling . &quot;
how can the sufferers have the problems get under control ?
there are quite a lot of parking spaces where you can get better sleep for a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ e@@ ß count on : regular sleeping and up@@ time times , not to sleep too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep far to sleep , alcohol m@@ ur and at night don &apos;t look at the clock - then you start immediately and this is totally and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;

airport : arrested in the gang of baggage
professional th@@ ie@@ be at the airport Düsseldorf
&quot; civil servants , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police achieved the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ ver@@ susp@@ ects had committed as a gang of several hand@@ bag and luggage valves .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf was a gang again , which was known by the police officers of past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several Deli@@ vered since mid July of this year , and were collaborative , working , and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Cri@@ mes Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can include the di@@ ligence , the stand@@ alone for criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts of actions . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had exploited a total of more than 15,000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ t @-@ trees , in between yet another cob@@ bl@@ estones , the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedri@@ ch@@ sha@@ in works at first glance not so , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking down the road from east to west , one gets along the grounds , a fres@@ her nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the façade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; tested .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ d@@ l that is supposed to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about these &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; like the real estate company Friedri@@ ch@@ sha@@ in , however , become preferred for the last weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile have the residents rental orders , on the ground floor they are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year Hen@@ kel , especially the Berlin Interior ator Hen@@ kel had spoken out several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after the 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor , which had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks long official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , blocked parts of the street and kept visitors away from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , its renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown house@@ holders are the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clear@@ ance had been illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers moved under the itch of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talking to vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located .
&quot; lef@@ tist force is not the main ones of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who stood here three children above all , are gener@@ alized by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of household projects , they share the concern from rising ri@@ v@@ ets and g@@ entri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a p@@ ines who would like to want to know mostly Poli@@ ze@@ al utz against v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , that of the Berlin in@@ sen@@ ator and the police have asc@@ ending their neighbors and their neighbours , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedri@@ ch@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which is today compared to the rest of the city a low average and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; also home @-@ occupied projects and the resulting housing projects belong to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including the entire Main@@ zer street all near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under great police rose , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : with them , the inhabitants from the GDR @-@ times and former house @-@ occupied countries share their pine forest . &quot;
&quot; this has also been noticeable in the rents , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them in the sli@@ ces or fresh fac@@ ades , which have been thrown with color @-@ explo@@ iters . &quot;
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; lef@@ tist autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason for this is that not all neighbours can see that as a problem , it could not be affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury rely on statistics almost exclusively against poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences make damages , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial in 17 years , can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; concerning violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbors , which are not determined . &quot;
&quot; even the famous burning cars also do not give it any longer in the Rig@@ a@@ er , even longer . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary , &quot; Here you help each other , live together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has become aware of the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße and has remained .
&quot; therefore , it was so important to her that the inhabitants returned their street : from the police , politics and the media that suddenly become the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : thanks to the rebel@@ li@@ ous re@@ constructions in former buildings that sup@@ press the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well known , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not gu@@ ardi@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if one never stops anyone ? &quot;
&quot; there is frustration at all sides of frustration , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for zo@@ omed to po@@ ke about paint bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev . &quot;
those who are going to be aware should be aware - just like someone who runs in a pub that can complain bad about noise .
&quot; all persons presented only with preliminary names have asked , not to be called with their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee office
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
&quot; furthermore , it is a social worker on the spot . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ch@@ le is the refugee quot@@ a for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ es supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berg .
&quot; she sees himself as a contact person for all players : refugees , labour conditions , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the labour re@@ is indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ins@@ ati@@ able wool @-@ sau , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; so some - less spot@@ ting than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant , as the administration wanted to write the site . &quot;
&quot; sought after an administrative company with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , an ins@@ ati@@ ful W@@ oll@@ m@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administration is not its central area , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; most of all it is about organization , work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as net income . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ per cent on three years with a rate of extension .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ - and full @-@ owned actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small issues , organizational , human and dec@@ eption problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the washing road
&quot; the most serious problem has been to be recognized for some time , apartments for connecting flights , which have been acknowledged . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for connecting the connection .
you need to accom@@ o@@ date the refugees in your own or rented residential premises .
&quot; the cost of construction , the rent or the refurb@@ ishing of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the land@@ office to the commune and job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; they have not been working so far , to be dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ ter@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be re@@ inde@@ xed as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers will soon be set up in the washing road . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , the Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ les agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a solid lead , it is train@@ able , training places , school places , one @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and helpl@@ ess@@ ation for refugees and migrants that need to be requested or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help house@@ master , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but not only do work mean .
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so it offers offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so we also jump here administration and community @-@ community .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are in Germany , and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to declare to the refugees that it just takes and can make it useful for the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone , do not work and be useless , which will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but problem occurs also , says customer honest , &quot; people , at which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ les and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two have fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what may call a na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; . &quot; a res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could and would not end it out . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed are the hel@@ pers but already .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have been afraid that the attacks bring them completely into submission .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to remain in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and community @-@ community must hold on site and in the region to activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new pile of refugees and migrants would come to Ur@@ bach soon .
Germany needs a ceiling ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is shy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not there yet , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that Ur@@ bacher will be able to properly integrate the previous people reasonably .
&quot; these are currently about 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
the political world situation is so complex as there is no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : re@@ bre@@ cher with helicopter sought
the police helicopter flew around one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are forced on Friday morning against 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the lin@@ den .

the flag@@ ging was running without success .
