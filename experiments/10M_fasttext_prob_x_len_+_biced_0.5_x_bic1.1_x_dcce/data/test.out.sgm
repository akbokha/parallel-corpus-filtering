<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinics and trumps economic policy compared to: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP Trade Agreement - this is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are however in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">Who is on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep that small in doubt, and warned that how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to lead the economy to death and regulate, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, maintains Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return to regulations, and it is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton said against it, The state has certain tasks to meet, he has handified chance of opening and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost worshipped."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly opposed to the state-critical teard-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"thus, on Trump, we could have yet party internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power plants and uptake the coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil-mining should also be possible in so far protected areas as to the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton wants to strengthen and expand the renewable energies with its investment programme:" "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two rivals are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"PP, the transpose-fish trade agreements, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of us want to isolate the US not from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"this should then be paid better then, call for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase her to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must renter, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him before, so that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton faces at least from the rich people want to pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social welfare offers in Bavaria, and among other things deals with the topic women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poulded.</seg>
<seg id="16">"they live in Munich's north, one of the few decentral accommodations for all-fleeting women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made up the institution together with Pro Family and the Munich's welfare benefits."</seg>

<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not excessive to say: any woman who arrives here, has made her flight experience with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because they are politically persecuted, because torture or death will threaten or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women undermines other reasons for escape:" "many stealing themselves secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forced to see honorary murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>

<seg id="29">"the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells us."</seg>
<seg id="31">Also here all the women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worst.</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the district of Munich, traumatized them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say they have nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often don't have to help themselves, there will be more accommodations for them, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>

<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben alone, women are not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken, there are in some common shelters or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>

<seg id="44">"in a study published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "alliance of foreign boards"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish backlist in the decilant hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in reception, I cannot deny that Ankara is going to do this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles worked allippig, and he radiant barely heat, even for his back-down conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day I described a newspaper that Erdogan was heard so called, it would never make things worse."</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, sustainable coolness showed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in its introductions: the depreciation of a Russian struggle against Turkey on the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was burnt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to put Russia into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"this was even bigger, as it was committed by a alleged friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding up again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks were carrying the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations from leading officials, that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria could have benefited from the so-called Islamic state."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire lie clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes first and foremost all the friends who can get after the last month at a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and chartering companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught at the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week predicted the national TV as much as fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported will be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemographic formulated it:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because it's reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the lasting Groll of the European accession negotiations and Putin - the pierpike is to draw the cool benefits from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara with certainty, the Russian state of State won a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he tried to support the elected government bodies after the tried coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-evident for Moscow, a matter of course that itself has a deep-sitting fear of regiments."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, as it was a analyst once described," "Alliance of outer lateral" ": two countries, who turn away from the West and treated badly and now."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently launched the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing parties."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of first discussions, both presidents spoke at the press conference, that they didn't even understand the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey betraed it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as NATO member of the Russian battjet aboss - it certainly is better that the two leaders at least talk together."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in future, the SPD and Green Party mean: investors should in future be much stronger in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD suggests a" "action concept" "at the next Ratssession."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first and foremost, it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build urban areas in the future, needs to be 20 percent of all the apartments known as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be found in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute settlement in the city hall is, however," "Bratmann:" "how do you work with investors, who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments build as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new municipal housing program, which will cost millions and will have to be financed."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as viola:" there is currently no agreement between the political groups. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few provisions as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left does not want to make hardness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of it, Bratmann, bahne becomes a tightening of the situation at the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"when the action concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program is not entirely different: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you like the loss of more about 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion is going out over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">Until the year 2020 it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planner spokesperson in Nicole Palm, should now be bought on ongoing ties from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to pick up apartments back into the price of price."</seg>

<seg id="27">Because in the west-city the end-end dates are coming.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could get back to the price-binding apartments in the price of affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this is not wanting the owners, the housing companies do not want. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after all, the number of social housing in the west-city will dramatically increase, removed from the goal of the so-called diarrhea."</seg>
<seg id="31">There will no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>

<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities outdoors are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were created first for the video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overlsted the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go out with their smartphone to outside and search for Pokémons that were tracked with a GPS once they were once found," photographed "(about a screenshot on the phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger younger, joined the expectation, and sprang up for the search of the sofa."</seg>

<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring about" "30 minutes" "to get active" "from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day, because many public messages are getting bored and come from people who are looking for."</seg>

<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderfull on Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, that they are fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also maces that must always complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like FitBit could already pursue our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be left with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, because of Pokemons's success there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activity can be combined in the real world and help with many people on the hunt will help to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legally native.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also still unwigors and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the unequal treatment of opponents, for example - the question arises: what does that actually have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be put in speech that the attacks from Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people were worried about the high refugee numbers for safety."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that most people occupy deeply, are not settled in election times even in election times."</seg>

<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>

<seg id="36">In the past few days it was high between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garganger dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a safety policy collection of some Unions interior, in which the resists also demand a burka ban and a return from the double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also blowing here to conciliatory sounds.</seg>

<seg id="40">We have committed the discussion in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="2">Difficult men middle ages love boards.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you visit the commentary in order to oversaw him under the pseudonym non-leenigenmen with rough insults, this statement directs itself from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the many-expressed reconstruction of records is not on a boom in millennials that want to welcome the repercussions of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record people retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soho, I carry my hands and be wild before I steal, keep my hands and tell something certain as:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos is slowly adding to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera to the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetable by watching."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle aged) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, presumably on the 20) follow, is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores in order to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this record-plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I'm not followed home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he did not afford to purchase and buy objects that he sold, when he was young and pleted."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early seventies, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy the records are more introverted and happy to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I drink not much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believe also that many customers who meet, which he meets to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and causes themselves to be bought back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the rectory of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record stores provides a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some plate-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar soundattentions, of objects, the happy Jugenderinnings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WHZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flutes a staff from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people bought a record of the last month, they have not yet been listened to."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey was also found out that 41% possess a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I saw through a pile of Bossa Nova Compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42 who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men aged aged) has noticed a" trophy aspekt "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone has only recently been here and said," I don't own record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musician."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who come first."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stop that has devoted to the gramophone nearly a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos, teenagers and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts New synthesizers and far-packed pop instead of experimental jazz briers from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but nave mental traumas are hard to imagine if one stands beside someone over 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs in the business for several minutes and looks at the variation of the plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to have a showcase of a showcase than a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not earn much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from one computer or another way but the beauty of plates is... it drives out with a loved sigh sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, from which it is said that a new generation of plate-lovers should have inspired: urban outfits."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to mute the jeans hotels, I watched a group of young teenagers, grouped for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter are considering to buy a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees her - maybe because they are merely purely decorative, some so far above it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "disk-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry, and some customers might send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, that is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research inquiries made that the results of YouGov vote, they let, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and records, which exist in reality, record business and in Onlinefores exist unconsidered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the bumble through records of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while taking the stubborn look of an uncanny, 30-year-wrong moderator, which protrudes through the shoulders of nothing of the middle ages."</seg>

<seg id="6">"from 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies of worlds, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Llop, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to take deeper into the wallet."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fees are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>

<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, there are also over- or submissions from the previous calculation period."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in the pumping space, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and in the pond position, after nearly 20 years of operation the first Klärteich had to be installed and an additional ventilation system should be installed in order to be able to keep the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>

<seg id="5">"news-service information, which were typically used by high-level CentCom Commandeuren, marked regularly a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services," cited a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom, is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses will be presented our political leaders," "Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>

<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct reference to that government tips given under Obama instructions to change the reports, it shows how analyst faced the pressure from their predecessors, an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom Annobility was publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings, while the investigation will be continued."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway through the General Government of Defense Department."</seg>
<seg id="18">"democratic members of the intelligence agencies published on Thursday their own findings, which coincides with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years of 2014 and 2015 CentCom created an overly restricted process for drawing up-to-date assessments under ISIL and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest ranking democrat in the commons, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Shias," delayed the publication of "" reports "," the morality of the analysts and "gave some little room for deviating opinions."</seg>

<seg id="25">"but he also assumed that" experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense. "</seg>

<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest adjustment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recall that more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, the recommendations of many analysts looked forward to a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 victories over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said, they cannot remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"this, however, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are still in their group with the Britons on the first place that remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which both of them will gain first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed will take a little longer in the strong hols who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as usual, the game may occur on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story, four years after they landed at last London games in the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time in three years (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008 because it could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the subsequent year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, the coach of the National Team, and thus began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a body transition," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work record in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to tear the Ruder completely around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursdays Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a setback from the closeup.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the playing hall from 1-0 to the third quarter, until they took their hands in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she did a Sprint with the flat ball over the left side, then moved into the middle and swallowed the ball into the gate to get a 2-0 guided tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>

<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late it is, there are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro make a steady and inescapable of a rapid run between competition and quest."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic Fackel itself is a burning off, that is passed from bracelets to the swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn off the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop, without the Simone Biles, Katie Leafy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's hot with dimples could have been well-known among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and wellness-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, Turner, or even Fechter."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not lit up any event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow there are the sports that are not generally recognized: air brush, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may have long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been debut in Sydney, it became the last 16 years as sparse that many that, I interviewed, did not know that it is at all a Olympiasportart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in a trampoline, and until 2012 had an athlete that made it until the end of the final."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians that share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a trampoline has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds for unenlightened ear passable for a clownsschule than that sounds for the Olympic Games. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a few enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end cloud tlenders - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports that unites it essentially."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, slums and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympias, you will be evaluated according to the execution, difficulty of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The non-sampled olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallers hoping to go upward in their pursuit of gold, faster, upward and above, sometimes down to the finish, sometimes back and back, to the top and down the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they chase not only the Ziellinie or the output wall, but also a further undermining target: the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I don't want to look at the listings of these games as something.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward-forward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prt from, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes upwards, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, not a firmament in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's just as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia spread to violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens were killed during clashes with the police in scusssion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the past few months, protests against the government of the country and are moving in more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people walked down to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses put witnesses that policemen were shot on tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"moving videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safe people strike young people with staves, while these were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold up this country and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopians economy expanded at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendulum in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, with dissident effective to be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have other options except to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in the central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">"there are numerous ailments, which cover all from the soil use to the spice in relation to power of the ruling coalition."</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time the tensions stop along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for these jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogades, who were forced to use turmoil and rearming the turbulence in recent years."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of stretching out before themselves sloping under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via the social media, as billigently smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government sees access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing at regular intervals, especially for protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies which conceal where they can stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians tried to gather themselves so too protectors.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since the times prosperized the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia in predominantly Christian highlands, in politics and the economy while the Oromos are exploited, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in areas of the amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which constitute approximately 6 percent of the population, which are dominant in the military service, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years as Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about facets."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly condensed in it to perceive early signs of discontentment as well as special officers to edit opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unsightly reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopians, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he enjoys not the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, according to allegations of analyst apparently rejected by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following sweeps were killed many protesters were killed, even though it were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts, Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protested in Gondar, an amharischen city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming increasingly common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronym flights over the neighboring Somalia, although they recently ended that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West definitely wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally collapsing in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," is a very thin breath. "</seg>

<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump did return to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he thought the accusation perfectly seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, the Republican presidential guard wanted nothing of it."</seg>

<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism as he thought, the Russians should crack Mrs. Clint Emails, but later he said" "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic borders in politics and then return after demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans will proceed as they arrive, and then" "clarify" "depending on how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe, he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defuse the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has taken an even older idea since its survey values went further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a guided tour with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative comments, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he's amplified the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal collaborators into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative may also be his statements."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps of prominent intercessors, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the accuracy of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in this sense it is true that Obama ISIS is an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most Mainstream Republicans attempt to argue that the government officially served by Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an Secretary of Foreign Minister, it is permitted to exclude himself by taking the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump put his attacks on the media and bowed them to ride on each of his words and to be taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he despised the" poor, "twilight" "television experts who try to understand and said," You can't. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the Sanna</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie got only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely swims the Greenland-shark at the bottom of the North Atlantic along the north, in an hour it is just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes up, the five metre long animal accelerates at satte 2,6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a rob."</seg>
<seg id="9">This long-way life-coined lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate by a Greenland, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means for cyclones a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist already anticipates that Greenland-haie are stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"about the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know accordingly little."</seg>
<seg id="17">Her temporal-empo measure her when they set up six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot do these sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly chase them sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for Kadaver, which torches from higher water layers down."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues looked at 28 Greenland-hay the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic Ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, during the largest 502 centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14-method the lens of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it were later no longer redone."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly a lot of carbon-14 in the lineup.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, her birth should lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons attempts to drag larger amounts of this radioactive carbon carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"with 220 centimetres in length of the third smallest animal, the linsenders contained a small surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities, which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for an 493 centimetres long Greenland an age of 335 years, while the record Hai can be aged with 502 centimeters even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females get back then, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign a age to the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably on the cusp to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland can obviously have at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Even this is likely to be the world-chord for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland-whale, located in its bacon at the neck a 120 year old harpoke lace, was captured before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the body of the living animals often runs on savings."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature thus later - and aging.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep hot water in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal gets heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on focusing as many descendants as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"in contrast, a very big animal should invest its resources more in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow reversal of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erved atmosphere, and yet slowly revolved."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect even faster."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rendition of Venus passes their day side of the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warmed the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer clouds, which appears like an umbrella, to cut the surface from a large part of the sunflower."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution of evolution that was previously thought of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabited, the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --has been exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was blown away by the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety scientists of F-Secure the beneficiaries have examined and come into contact with the blackouts and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or encode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must be partly tough and five-digit sums have to return to their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware-blackmail, the hacker will always be professional and share the work, the safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the Antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, it is that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software building on the actual blackouts.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits were created by the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmains then seek more hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a criminals and instructs another way to install the software on as many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infier calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually oversees the criminals then spammer of the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known in many companies that can secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">"over 50 percent of the companies-IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey, trust in order to repel Ransomware using file-back-ups and scans."</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have a sufficient threat to successful testing more, the perpetrators instead, with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, the potential for damages, according to the type of data, is much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators would be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackney Conference Defcon demonstrated the safety researchers as they could get one with the internet interconnected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the activation of such a block heating could be quite worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators rather than the heating in future block a whole production way in a factory, Ransomware might be a subject in industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you are walking forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning there is no more to think of sleep in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do you speak sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there can be many causes underlying, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, Managing Director of the German Society for Schlafforgery and sleeping medicine."</seg>

<seg id="8">"just that can sleep many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Managing Director at the German home medical association with practice in the lower-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can organic, mental or diluted factors, but also medicines are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the novice expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is common especially in depression," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors print each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a slipped disk, can lie badly, guarded all two to three hours and starred on, about everyday problems and worry, gives Weeß an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not well located over a period of one month in a minimum of three nights per week and is impaired by the day, should go to the physician, betraying."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment may look quite different: it is downcast, tired, unexhausted, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has voting fluctuations or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleeping disorder, it is important to find their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as a treatment options, among other things are behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping-coated only in exceptional cases and a maximum for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, Ngo Fietze has hardly been emphasized in Germany, Professor Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, one should contact the physician first at bedtime, betraying Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">He can clarify the problems whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was to sleep in the sleeping laboratory and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">"to investigate in sleeping laboratory, medicine for example with snoring with respiratory infections, in sickness-day-fatigue, in sleeping, or if one does not find the cause of a sleepy disorder."</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make lunch," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After cab one goes to his normal time in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-wearing, a chest strap and a antennae at the finger."</seg>

<seg id="7">"in the beginning of the year Henkel, especially the Berlin Interior ator Henkel had spoken out several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area called" no-go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor, which had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks long official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, blocked parts of the street and kept visitors away from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, its renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown householders are the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers moved under the itch of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talking to vorm Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects a primary school and kindergartens are located.</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist force is not the main ones of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who stood here three children above all, are generalized by the police presence."</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee office</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">"furthermore, it is a social worker on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuchle is the refugee quota for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagoges supports the management team around Achim Grockenberg.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees himself as a contact person for all players: refugees, labour conditions, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the labour reis indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that deuschle is now there, the insatiable wool-sau, which has above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so some - less spotting than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant, as the administration wanted to write the site."</seg>
<seg id="9">"sought after an administrative company with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, an insatiful Wollmchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administration is not its central area," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"most of all it is about organization, work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as net income."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-per cent on three years with a rate of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle Ehr- and full-owned actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small issues, organizational, human and deception problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"the most serious problem has been to be recognized for some time, apartments for connecting flights, which have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accomodate the refugees in your own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, the rent or the refurbishing of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the landoffice to the commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"they have not been working so far, to be dependent on private apartments, so Deuterle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be reindexed as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers will soon be set up in the washing road."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, the Regine customer and Annika Deules agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a solid lead, it is trainable, training places, school places, one-Euro-jobs and helplessation for refugees and migrants that need to be requested or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help housemaster, do charitable work - and this motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But not only do work mean.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it offers offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump here administration and community-community.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are in Germany, and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to declare to the refugees that it just takes and can make it useful for the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach anyone, do not work and be useless, which will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but problem occurs also, says customer honest," people, at which nothing goes. "the work of Deules and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer quite clearly," what may call a naïve "." a restrisiko could and would not end it out. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized are the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have been afraid that the attacks bring them completely into submission.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to remain in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and community-community must hold on site and in the region to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new pile of refugees and migrants would come to Urbach soon.</seg>
<seg id="57">Germany needs a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy is shy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not there yet, where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that Urbacher will be able to properly integrate the previous people reasonably.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently about 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complex as there is no simple answers.</seg>
