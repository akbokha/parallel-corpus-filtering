Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has not been friend@@ liest .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teheran &apos;s destabil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , it should also be a conflict with the Palestinians and the comm@@ uting two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington critici@@ zed the continued sett@@ ling of Israel and thro@@ ws a lack of faith in the peace process .
the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme by Obama has deterior@@ ated the relationship of the two further deterior@@ ates .
&quot; in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress in front of the US Congress held as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , but a meeting had rejected this reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
in a notebook met Professor of having shot his girlfriend
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon was told with a somewhat omin@@ ous voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; represented it important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; yet still live and probably be excited and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officers found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was attached to a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could not go , I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed , already 300 miles to the school premises , where he has killed and killed a popular history professor at school , E@@ ane Schmidt , at the door of his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he has made the dre@@ ad@@ ful emergency call after that .
&quot; by the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life , when the police took him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university that students and faculty are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said that they would be happy about their teaching .
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ s died , &quot; &quot; he did not have a history of violence or criminal record . &quot;
&quot; he did not mention a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic lives . &quot;
&quot; both incorporated in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose apprenticeship is 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time some tendencies were too problematic .
&quot; he &apos;s a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who &apos;s praised , he seemed a little excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes said that the lamb tells him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he previously carried the Delta State University to asked for health reasons for health reasons and told that he had some health problem .
this year he applied only two online courses .
&quot; in recent changes in employment policies of the university , the promotion that has worked so hard for workers was not a guarantee of an automatic way to an adjustment as Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; he told nothing about a conflict between Paul and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
it &apos;s questions that he &apos;s not able to answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found stro@@ bs later by Lam@@ bs , when he came to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he was arrested , he &apos;s self @-@ confident with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the backyard of a house approximately a mile south of his parents @-@ house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ ons Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb was at this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew in the area .
&quot; Lamb began in 2009 his work at the University , who has 3.@@ 500 students in a city with about 12.@@ 000 residents and settled geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of friendship lam@@ bs accepted him as intelligent . charis@@ matic and funny .
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when she met through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to give her the guitar game . &quot;
he was at that time of the women &apos;s flock .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; I said in the emergency , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no medicine from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick building that borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was in order .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed there and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; he said , he has never met , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb was represented pro@@ w@@ ess when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had both appeared in a summer year ago .
&quot; later , they played together the one or the other G@@ ig . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes , and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse used online for various companies on @-@ line .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertaining bar at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near Gau@@ tier , told that he &apos;s represented and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night kic@@ ked off the night on 5 September , after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ ul@@ ant to an end in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there were no signs that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the left and cher@@ ished each other .
&quot; me , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized on American indigenous and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , a English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
&quot; he studied at the State of State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his Brotherhood and of the Committee . &quot;
&quot; at the Delta State campus in Cle@@ veland , on the Tuesday night about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the assembly took part in a candle @-@ service ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the memorial , during the university &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; amazing grace &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the classes will resume on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ head P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans helped to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police said now that he did not rep@@ ute the emergency , and that the lamb recorded in his emergency rep@@ ute as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us is planning to hire less labour for the Christmas time

Michael J. Fox talks about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons also .
&quot; we sat in the theater for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat beside me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is seated beside me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; &quot; Back in Time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a sim@@ ulated and a tail @-@ length of it , with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interview with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest Time Travel @-@ Film , which was ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be based on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinemas in October . &quot;
&quot; UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot;
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s greater military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict ; and more weapons will wor@@ sen the violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; the UN Chief is once again calling for all parties , including the UN Security Council shared by UN Security Council , to unite and to support an inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its of the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; B@@ an asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity when dealing with the crisis in Syria , demonstrated it in achieving a nuclear de@@ pot with Iran . &quot;
&quot; 8 Re@@ frac@@ tures , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks amongst surveys , it has ( still ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to ask themselves seriously what it means to the chance of nom@@ ination of real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
but of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody wants that Tr@@ ump will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership has been given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but outside brack@@ ets like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative Economic group Club for Growth are now realizing a few m@@ umps and begin to let their dollar flow , to overthrow it . &quot;
here are some current survey values which indicate that the real estate is Mo@@ gu@@ l not only a temporary phase :
umps levels have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Re@@ public@@ ans have seen the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view on Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early countries .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump than candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week , 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if l@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son generate about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they would be &quot; &quot; low &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , will be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ can sees l@@ umps of temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the British @-@ re@@ public@@ ans believe that the real temper@@ ament of a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first Pre @-@ electoral state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent , that he has not the personality to execute effectively his job , and almost six of 10 crimes will tell that his temper@@ ament does not move into the White House , so ABC / post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters are used to get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose her nest @-@ guard , hold Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination one week after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from past week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
it &apos;s been a change since the time when four of ten will put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete dis@@ closing : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the final cycle , four of ten Re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to just 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless it shows that a large number of GO@@ P &apos;s voters can be viewed in a plau@@ sible campaign .
&quot; even when the Republi@@ can arose by another candidate , Tr@@ ump is propos@@ ing nearly anyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts indicate that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to tr@@ umps , while anti @-@ stri@@ pping support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will appoint the multi @-@ health support . &quot;
&quot; he has before C@@ early Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , mainly Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before the border Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the business with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans tells them their opinion have formed .
&quot; a new survey conducted by CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters support the dump , say they have to fix their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said they let the door open , so that they can change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; yet , the umps sharp@@ est competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon &apos;s Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say , that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration . &quot;
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , two months ago called &quot; immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; was the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expres@@ siveness of Tr@@ ump of Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and shall damage the new government efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in immigration questions . &quot;
&quot; as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will seem to do . &quot;
the frustration of the government clim@@ bs up to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son exp@@ ires about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , particularly by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the New Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Re@@ public@@ ans about the Republi@@ can in Congress are frustr@@ ated , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive motorhome in Germany &quot;

&quot; in the street , it costs a square meter roof in the average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is limited by nature , so it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special La@@ dies cost a square meter most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student dog in Munich are not really little . &quot;

a lucky hit by Thomas Müller eb@@ arranged the FC Bayern their way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then it ran .
a sovereign state of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario I@@ tz@@ e have sent a dream start to the &quot; mission of Milan &quot; with FC Bayern in Wit@@ en@@ kes@@ sel .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won its debut in the Champions League at the Greek record Master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers . Un@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es @-@ results ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves to be with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth step @-@ victory in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to finally catch the Hen@@ kel@@ f@@ t in the third round . &quot;
Müller received at his 28 hit in the Champions League in the Champions League of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os team of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto which took one as a f@@ lange of his shot of the world &apos;s birthday .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , &quot; had Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis @-@ stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ flo@@ cks of fans - and the Munich sitting . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and committed performance , without shine . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus has won his recent six home games in the Royal class , including famous clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 he saw Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; however , Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams was defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bol@@ dly , with their aggressive efforts , but often to resour@@ ce@@ ful of works . &quot;
the attacks were often introduced by the lap@@ se on the left of the Costa Rica to the former SPD of Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i against the former SPD of Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck left from right when his flan@@ k hit the right corner on the left corner of Tor@@ que .
at the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave possible the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye proposed the head of Poland by the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct delivery , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bavaria was used as a dominant game , it was possible to put Piraeus needle pun@@ ches . &quot;
on Tor@@ por@@ ters Manuel Neu@@ er was but abandoned .
so about when he got a shot of Ide@@ ye by the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; before leaving , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ dimensional chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ res , sat first out . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given only after the closing down green light , Sport@@ sman told Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; those who want to make something else of them , that is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he got King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the lead to lead ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later all clear , by El@@ f@@ ard Müller appointed a dr@@ one . &quot;
before the game it came to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .

who smo@@ kes has a higher risk to lose teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , hur@@ ds not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this will be a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : in aband@@ on@@ ment the risk is fast .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth soon .
&quot; this is from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees from the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , there was the risk of losing their teeth prematurely to the 2.@@ 5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major causes for dental failure , c@@ aries and inflammation of the fl@@ esh@@ y , highlights the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore going to return to frequent g@@ um disease in smokers .
&quot; not clear , to what extent smoking also increased the risk of dental c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; people who have heard of smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the threat turned back to the level of non @-@ smokers , Er@@ du@@ sts Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , student leader H@@ einer Boeing that DI@@ e : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings , also cause a good dental health to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany more than 20 per cent of the population is affected at the age of 65 to 74 years of perio@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed . &quot;
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking is high risk for early br@@ anding .
the new long @-@ term study sub@@ mer@@ es the findings .

European Commission breaks new court in talks about TTIP
&quot; for the removal of the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a vast reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
the controversial private arbitration institutions for differences between companies and states should therefore be resolved by a more transparent system because in its functioning there is significantly more traditional dishes .

plans to re@@ forming the current arbitration proceedings cont@@ end specifically for the EU states and the U.S. to set up independent judges for a new investment .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
it is planned for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against judgment .
&quot; so far the procedures involved refer to arbitr@@ ator , an objection to their judg@@ ments , there was not . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she wants to go to an International Investment Court in the long term . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clarified . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbitration rules , especially of large @-@ trun@@ cated investor @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional refer@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by oppos@@ ers as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ist , about the company damages tax@@ payers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act awarded the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient .
critic@@ ises the case that she did not apply for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic Secretary of Matthias Mak@@ nig ( SPD ) indicated the plans as a great progress .
&quot; the Commission considered essential points for the reform , which Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbitration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe war@@ ded to limiting the pi@@ ti@@ ation of the economy through too many new rules .
&quot; particularly small and medium enterprises could be disadvantaged , it meant . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on TTIP TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed , on Wednesday it remains unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA so far .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
the date is considered to be no longer un@@ sustainable .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ l debut in the prime minister of Prime Minister with excitement .
the new Labour @-@ president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall be his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and made his debut for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n shall rise to ask for the first of his six given questions shortly after noon and its performance by the media is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; fewer &quot; theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ pping some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s guidance , because after being appointed as a member of the shadow of the shadow and following his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour President , on Tuesday during the withdrawal of the National An@@ them during a commemor@@ ative ceremony to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence and stands at the center of several title @-@ pages @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Dec@@ ision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted a lot of attention &quot;
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he stood in &apos; respectful &apos; silence and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s Schatten@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got to sing the Labour leaders , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve as the national team by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they were appointed as leaders of the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Party of the Party was originally supported by the leaders . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are being st@@ acking within the Labour Party , namely by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s pronoun@@ cements on the position of the European Union and the limitation in revenue . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put forward the Labour changes in order to completely remove the whole idea of a restriction .
&quot; so hours later Mr Smith said the shadow - and R@@ ent Minister , that the Party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans , to reduce the limit of 26 000 £ on 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chair by David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory Chef , over the last decade to deal with the Disp@@ atch box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour Chair , who promised a different political approach , says that he has been given a &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions concerning Mr. Cameron and have given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP did say that the Fra@@ gan@@ ese of the Prime Minister is to counter @-@ head and that he has under support both &quot; &quot; perc@@ ussion &quot; &quot; and the fighting with resistance , and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , that is represented in the shadow of economic ministry , if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is on the way . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues can occasionally seize the word , and that he was John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; he said leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said to be s@@ lugg@@ ish himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre , &quot; who often linked with the watch@@ dogs of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he moved into it he has failed . &quot;
&quot; since they were first sent on TV in 1990 , the question was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer for the leader of a leader and his leadership in the House of Represent@@ atives and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued , they had become a caricature and a far @-@ sufficient reform . &quot;

&quot; the Po@@ unds was spr@@ ink@@ le @-@ like after data , which shows an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE was up 100 by the main objective of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the result grew without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest possible for the year in 2009 and was estim@@ ating upon the time of an interest rate .
&quot; the Po@@ unds rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over the Rival AB in@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands like Bud@@ ě@@ d , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competitor Group for DEL@@ U@@ RA@@ I@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
judge &apos;s newest sales figures strike up all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - om@@ it growth .
&quot; shares of Glen@@ core climbed by 5 % , after the mining company said that he had spent 2.5 billion $ by a share of shares as part of its strategy of debt relief . &quot;

&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % , after the finishing company had signed a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endangering the expansion .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this buying power will yield the higher labour force at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer opportunities . &quot;

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster sets the Lebanese of the potato idea
potatoes or don@@ er ?
&quot; it is both - and in the potato dic@@ ant , who has developed the Ol@@ denburg @-@ hostess Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato instead of &quot; &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat worked together on a mirror . &quot;
&quot; on the idea he brought him a poster at a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly in television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop , a barbecue , that is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has now joined the magazine in Munich in the meantime at the patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the agency , it has recently protected as a utility model . &quot;
how much meat and how much potatoes of the mirror does not want Al@@ ha@@ y to reveal .
&quot; it &apos;s just as much : &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the culinary international understanding come along well . &quot;
Met@@ cash starts the rec@@ ir@@ responsible campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ -
Met@@ adata attempts to protect the Ig@@ A shop in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched an insur@@ rec@@ tor campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di prepare the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ adata and Ig@@ A supermarkets are strengthening its relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstream marketing and marketing about the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like king@@ makers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ ours borough that distributed in Ig@@ A stores samples and shop @-@ owner , the cheapest tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ adata is further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices perform its annual investors strategy . &quot;
&quot; it stands much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia will account for almost 30 per cent of met@@ a @-@ Ig@@ A @-@ charging business , and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ cas@@ a Ig@@ A network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; locals in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and Ig@@ A retailer have much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in East Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut out about five percent of the food market in these two countries after the opening of its first markets and to take away all existing players , but mainly on independent and retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report released this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley reported that Ig@@ A @-@ Ret@@ t will lose 360 million euros a year and Met@@ ric 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this prognosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened up to 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , with a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in the food and gro@@ c@@ eries , and with the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ hes high fix@@ ture , could cost some 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ ric market shares in the east states , notably on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ purchases are the most likely . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in food and grocery store will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 to reduce 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent by 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , during a business meeting in Melbourne , will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
met@@ a declined to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ adata with Mr Dou@@ glass has made contact by Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food trade , which has about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A @-@ retailer , is about 43 percent of its operating debt recovery on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholesale distributor for@@ bid more than 150 million $ , to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ ds@@ men by hundreds of products every week at the same and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh food and providing a better choice of private @-@ label foods . &quot;
Met@@ cas@@ hs main business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice tells that the Price adap@@ tations and loading programmes are to be made to vig@@ our and hopes that the wholesale distributor will return to regain control growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ e@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves rather praise than criticism for its behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ e@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and earned a view of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of talented Du@@ os that is always called &quot; Special Cas@@ s , &quot; by the in@@ famous examination of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery Quali@@ fications in Cincinnati soon after then , Kok@@ e@@ akis , and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated by the refer@@ ee , wher@@ ein Harrison had to beat out : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a var@@ ic@@ f reached a potential US Open victory from Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was def@@ ender of He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen is currently at Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in second place in the single table behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing that I strug@@ gled me fairly , is the fact that according to my opinion Than@@ asi a little pushed into the dispute . &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et as he lost because of a cl@@ amp@@ er in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ h well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open and even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around you , and I believe that he was a little too severe . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he exercises hard , he is good in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also helped K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os to take into account the decision taken by K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right thing for everyone , but to return to the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term basis into the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish the team to completely focus on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe Nick was very quick to have made Ascension , making people like he@@ ather and Mur@@ ray . he goes up in the eyes of the public and he deserves some of the criticism that he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s Refu@@ ge@@ crisis : Hungary declared emergency rule , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the p@@ avilion , and drew the south@@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all who tried to reach illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were killed in a Ne@@ and@@ s@@ land accum@@ ulate and Serbian officials with rebellion . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence , were hidden for an un@@ familiar time in a land strip on the road between the two controls of the countries and built tents , and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; as a police helicopter ride over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; opens the border &quot; &quot; opens the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elling ins@@ ults against the Hungarian administration @-@ police . &quot;
some were taken back in protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would send back from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral harm .
&quot; in the next few days talks with Brussels and other countries take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ bloc with a strict immigration policy in Brussels at a stringent meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people that have fallen shelter in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would ensure that the EU states would include more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put his hopes for an upcoming event in Brussels or by its neighbours .
&quot; on Tuesday , rested in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum proceedings . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country has to stop the construction of a go@@ os@@ y wi@@ pe along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisons in the race , to create bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months Hungary , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East for a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and input of input into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most incoming economic migrants are on the search for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force by midnight , in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the har@@ ming of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall za@@ uns , to rebuild the government along the southern border with Serbia , for a crime . these laws also put higher detention centres for condemned men . &quot;
&quot; on account of the situation , which was created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man T@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament has to agree with the use of the military even today , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen standing on the border with vehicles and dogs on days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ ers for Or@@ ban , said that authorities spend 45 people in trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penetr@@ ated further into the country . &quot;
they come over by damage the fence ; they are now in police forces and will be accused of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are doing the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials joined the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed @-@ wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ ged the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and op@@ pressing a crowd of people to go there . &quot;
&quot; around 20 failed to reach it , but thousands left outside . &quot;
another group of migrants turns the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
choice @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s Vor@@ sprung before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to maintain a double @-@ digit head start in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins their face on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he nomin@@ ee for the presidential election , receives support of 15 percent of democratic voters of the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is certain of which candidates will support them . &quot;
&quot; however , Clin@@ &apos;s supporters are more permanent in their choice than those of the other candidates . &quot;
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders obtained some profits . &quot;
Clinton has a big lead in women and moder@@ ates but these le@@ aps have reduced .
&quot; their support among the men has fallen mark@@ edly , and so different here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has fle@@ dged themselves , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level . &quot;
Clinton has a big lead in the older voters .
&quot; last month Clinton had been in front of S@@ anders with a two @-@ cell lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the presidency did not say they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would be prefer@@ able to support them and further 15 percent would only support them because they claimed the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger with those who currently not support Clinton - just about a quarter would love them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ cho@@ ols they say that they can support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters this by their top candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ &apos;s supporters claim in an open question why they want them to be the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ &apos;s supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned . &quot;
consent to the handling of problems and voters are quoted .
&quot; since the Vice President launched a potential for the Office of the Office in the Office of the Office , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ cho@@ ke would like to see him in the race - although a third does not believe it should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked by the pres@@ election , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; of Clin@@ &apos;s followers say more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of us . &quot;
&quot; decides to not decide in favour of the nom@@ inations of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton increases her pre @-@ jump in S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds to win , but this figure has decreased by 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far the second with this measuring , but the percentage of the percentage he sees as the &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the question of what is more important for a Candi@@ date , call Democratic voters questions about voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate , or potenti@@ als candidate for those voters of the pres@@ election as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in choosing the vote of their party .
&quot; however , Clinton , S@@ ander and Bi@@ den are considered honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership . &quot;
&quot; bias cuts with the three candidates very best at honesty , while Clin@@ &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy it &apos;s twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 per cent ) , but 27 percent do not agree with him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pres@@ cho@@ ols generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , approximately a quarter of the democratic voters has no meaning of anything . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continued during the term as Foreign Minister , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explaining the matter and say that their opinions are not affected overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration while only about one third is satisfied .
&quot; public opinion occurred in March , shortly after the problem came to light , it is split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans told that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on the general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views on Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is seen by the voters of her party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters a total : 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the entitled to vote do not hold it for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the elec@@ tors have been seen as far as not honest and not trustworthy . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes at leadership .
&quot; for the six ex @-@ tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best refer to honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards himself rather than honest , but like with Car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic elec@@ torate in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves across a country in country and near Donald Tr@@ ump .
Ben Car@@ son &apos;s latest survey of the CB@@ S News / New York Times closely related to Donald Tr@@ ump
the two Candi@@ dates have now lap@@ sed over half the support of voters in the new survey and others lose a dras@@ tic control
&quot; Republi@@ can voters support nationwide Tr@@ ump in big numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey , which was conducted in front of Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey from Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son f@@ lowed in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son will arrive at demographic groups and makes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ early Fior@@ ina , and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ himself , is hit with Wis@@ cons@@ ins governor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the deepest , and 10 % in the last month , to now 2 % . &quot;
the former governor of the former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio find themselves with 6 % on the third place .
the bu@@ ke at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son is increasing in the pol@@ ls - it lands with 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the un@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed re@@ cl@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one over the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump , a few side @-@ flas@@ hes for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son used to question the dull faith in question . &quot;

pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if highest values are measured only in the distance , for bathing spots there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to provide even warm water . &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some goes no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; swi@@ m@@ temperatures continue to the Mediterranean Sea , while in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are exposed to the death of a Bar@@ uch College .
&quot; almost two years , after a student died during a post@@ operative ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ant will be filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i @-@ P@@ SI br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory period in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been bur@@ dened with his eyes with a 30 Po@@ und ru@@ ck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally def@@ endant about headaches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ SI br@@ otherhood did not get the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited about an hour before they brought him to hospital , leaving the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes to goo@@ gle their symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to give advice , said Police of Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ si@@ ly and placed the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood as a rule over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revived , and he died in the next morning at his wounds . &quot;
&quot; after an auto @-@ winning report , Den@@ g was repeated with mu@@ te force violations of head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the gun of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year at the ra@@ ils , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step is very important to the authorities . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ eight members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with joint attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved but if there is an organisation that - officially or officially - this has sanc@@ tioned , so we will also hold this to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College was prohibited by the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood will withdraw its affili@@ ation to the town . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; a p@@ ation of activity com@@ mu@@ te and the door is sli@@ pped into the che@@ eks , ren@@ ces for bonds will rise , and the economy will be pushed into a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy is only a small guide to the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest rates and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often albeit not always , one factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. bank have so inten@@ sely stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could determine that the whole excitement was possibly exaggerated because of an interest @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as being a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Apostle at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at the lowest level to the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to be frightened . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no implications . &quot;
here is a historical market @-@ based view to how some areas of business could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticipation of Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to raise capital from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the last 35 years , the market is mostly within the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to Zin@@ ser@@ tion , quite flat during the last six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to an actual analysis , Bob D@@ oll , boss plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on stocks tend to appear later in the Hei@@ gh@@ ing cycle and the returns with it begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but zinc in@@ clin@@ ations often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ts with some conditions which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; in this connection , the gross Dom@@ estic Product is near its lowest point at a p@@ inn@@ acle of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank the nominal GDP has declined in 1950 only in less than 4.5 percent , since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.@@ 6 percent , only few that will last this will last and expect the third quarter to obtain from Atlanta F@@ ed just 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; zinc in@@ caves in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and throw the question &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken all year on a p@@ inn@@ acle of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be approved for an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading gives only a 25 percent chance . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the enhancements have taken place in 1950 to today in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before the rec@@ essions were made very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest serving the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession . the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; the fixed income was also volati@@ le , since the market decreases a p@@ inn@@ acle , and the pattern is quite similar as in the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect in bonds will be faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; with bonds , the ren@@ ditions seem to change the direction once the first raise / reduction in the cycle occurs . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the cycle , the bond @-@ pick@@ pockets immediately fall , said the German bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will cause that Ren@@ ding between longer and shorter bonds will be closer together , and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve . &quot;
&quot; flood bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones believes that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy &quot; expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; in short @-@ term interest they have risen , earnings has increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies that get the greater part of their operations in the U.S. benefit , if interest rates rise and local produce become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debt will be worse , as an increasing number of dollars will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance its debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive , three months after an initial interest , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have out@@ done an average of 5 percentage points after each of the Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
company with high capital gains and low volati@@ lity in its shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality by average 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of the &quot; &quot; equity &quot; &quot; consumers can also benefit by the increasing dollars . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits through higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are how fast they will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM . says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transm@@ itter , because of its &quot; con@@ du@@ de &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said , that she im@@ it@@ ates only The Br@@ its . &quot;
&quot; parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the mission of The Voice and said , that this is not quite original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leader in parliament@@ arians and increases new pressure on the transm@@ itter to prove that he does something , which does not do the private station . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ er &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; is no longer able to distinguish anymore from his commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; silly &quot; - but it seems to transform Classic FM &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards held last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards held last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples you actually only have to im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Secretary dis@@ missed the dis@@ cards and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and education . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn any differently about classical music . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music @-@ making music really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and to give the dedication of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works in order , I really consider it important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that they need to be harder to engage the audience when it did in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only part of BBC production which , during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for this , led to the commercial ri@@ vals for their feet . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the musical Talent Cup of the BBC , who has been bought by Dutch producers of Tal@@ pa Media for a estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on special BBC mode .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit of our in @-@ house barn , &quot; if the next time it was a t@@ ein@@ ment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or give money to other negoti@@ ators for other negoti@@ ators . &quot;
Internet survey increased in August on the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there has been the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increases three years ago by using cell phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the expenses
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual arch was dri@@ lled and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into the gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
&quot; but experts say that there are now signs that the on @-@ line sales are st@@ agn@@ ant , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for early years and come back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales complex the Guardian . &quot;
he explained that the online sales grew more than three years ago when Bu@@ yer began doing shopping with their mobile phones .
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers can hold their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event , each taking place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers have been asking for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some retailer sites rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer set off due to bar@@ gains , buyers could prevent from it , shopping . &quot;
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found out that a total of 5 000 issues was spent more than 1 £ on online .
&quot; in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchase are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it buys more than a quarter of the people &apos;s clothes and shoes online rather than in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried the in Mecca during the crane @-@ accident ft - Bin Lad@@ ens family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims on the first bur@@ ial ground in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the gigantic Sau@@ cer Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition 3@@ 94 people were injured while the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the buried they were killed as a crane in Me@@ k@@ kas wholesale .
&quot; filled , mostly in white @-@ filled , largely dressed , the track in order to declare their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m &apos;s Grav@@ ey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went on to the holy place , where only days before a building cr@@ ater due to the blan@@ ket of the mosque , and then upon the expan@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , as the Saudi king passed through the construction company of the bin Laden because of the disaster , who also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction imposed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 keepers , who were killed , when a crane lined by the Great Central mo@@ ist Me@@ k@@ kas , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane spot@@ ted . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the launch of the annual H@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mecca with thousands who continue to come to town , will continue to go on . &quot;
&quot; today , king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group would not have to ste@@ al the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of Dec@@ ree , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news Agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company is forbidden . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this week Sal@@ man seemed to reveal what the overthrow of the crane caused , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the large mosque , where hundreds of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who were taking place later this month . &quot;
the Bin @-@ Laden Group published no statements about the collapse of the crane and their representative were not available for an opinion .
the Royal decree also bl@@ amed the group for not current safety measures and because it had not been co@@ operated with Meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of Kr@@ ays surrounded by Me@@ k@@ kas wholesale mo@@ can@@ ia as part of the massive construction project which is managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the family Bin Laden has been linked to the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has been taking over bigger construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ e@@ ased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an ab@@ omin@@ ous son , who was dispos@@ s@@ essed of the family in the 1990 @-@ 20 years . &quot;
&quot; crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy car . &quot;
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
government officials warned that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the people had to pay and the same amount of permanent injured .
others will be given the half of that amount .

&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , plans to open 200 other well @-@ known shops , which will be directed at craftsmen and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she would concern more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women .
&quot; right now , with the employees the men prevail . &quot;
&quot; she said , it is necessary to present the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than had more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry which represents one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index and has selected its top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company , which has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women to our Supervisory Board .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her announced a decline at the half @-@ year profit and the conver@@ ts , after the group was reduced the cost of the closing of the stores . &quot;
&quot; trends , King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity on trial
&quot; at the district Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday two Func@@ tion@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ ley @-@ mate A@@ I / DO@@ B , due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and acceptance will have to answer . &quot;
the def@@ endants have not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse of ministry .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May legally .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the pro@@ secutor of Robert Ri@@ ffel ( preliminary examination ) , the accused was allowed to disp@@ ose of money accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , to disp@@ ose of them in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage took place with around 400@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports@@ wear are also charged for financial statements .
&quot; this fact divided the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later time .
&quot; to re@@ pro@@ ach the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented that the association was at no time taken up a asset . &quot;
&quot; the sporting events have only been corro@@ bor@@ ated and de@@ ferred the sporting club for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money to carry out the debts in 2001 . the Pas@@ va remained around 600@@ ,000 shr@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we were standing before the situation : did we push the club further or block us ? &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ ung @-@ Grand @-@ firm of the Financial Officer . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and friends , he decided to take on this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have been raising money , executed our life insurance policies as safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the conf@@ is@@ cation . &quot;
with the association it had been agreed : you can manage the money freely and only debts could be made .
&quot; furthermore , in case of financial or financial success , the payout of the allowance for proposals had been retro@@ sp@@ ectively retro@@ sp@@ ectively . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance cuts is only years later , that from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account , paid off . &quot;
&quot; thus , even in @-@ scale and not detailed amounts of details , the former Ob@@ mann explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings managed the two def@@ endants in common , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association had not been revealed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in the financial aid in detail , be important only the forgiveness of forgiveness , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , as in 2011 , an official investigations carried out because of ministry figures began , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the account . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , they explained the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know a response for a long time .
&quot; he said finally , he thought that this is the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , he put the pro@@ secutor in the room . &quot;
the def@@ endant was kept informed of the function@@ ary .
this refer@@ ral was formulated as a repar@@ ation for repar@@ ation .
why damage ? ? did judge and pro@@ secutor want to know .
&quot; the first accused of the accused did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never created a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; You are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never referred to a cent content , he only comp@@ uted o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; in FA@@ D he added to the association 1,000 euros a month , but the actual cost has been much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years were not allowed to instruc@@ t the accused .
&quot; they were after a business check , where everything was judged correctly no longer , said . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also used the second indic@@ tee .
&quot; all Beh@@ ind were in cash , so that he has to drive from his residence the international market to the Bank in Blei@@ burg , explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial proceedings continues on 23 September with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard provides more than 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to for three years of ongoing personnel restructuring , the computer ri@@ men@@ esis is going to reduce further jobs in the computer @-@ spl@@ itting of the company . &quot;
the adju@@ sts in the US @-@ computer He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) can be found no end .
&quot; in the framework of its restructuring , the US technological group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30.000 places in its corporate body . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , expenses of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.8 billion euros ) should be saved , the company distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special exposure of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the last three years . &quot;
&quot; HP used the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , even around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of the Persian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has installed the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and water@@ front against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence of the bor@@ der@@ mal point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind it had formed a police line and behind the poli@@ cem@@ an stood a water@@ front .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began with stones , blocks and plastic bottles to throw down the officials . &quot;
the officers first put un@@ interrupted Min@@ t spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a .
much tear @-@ nar@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
so the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now somewhat abandoned .
a pregnant and apparently the last woman was taken away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had caught the tear @-@ eng@@ ths , scre@@ amed . &quot;
other refugees drow@@ ned in themselves and suffered under breathing .
&quot; also , the spokes@@ person of the Ser@@ b police suffered injuries by the use of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and pepper spray . &quot;
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world has been observed if the US staff will come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make an important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , asked by Re@@ uters , found that F@@ ed will do so , now that F@@ ed will continue to do so , and keep interest rates at the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate at N@@ UL@@ L . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a big central bank may end the zero @-@ area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Mr U@@ bi@@ des , guiding employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook to global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
deaths on the Delta State University leaving apologi@@ cul@@ ation
&quot; after the death and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi were on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed - Sh@@ annon wrote to him , &quot; &quot; I could &quot; &quot; do it &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; he could do it &quot; , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , teacher for geography and social sciences at the Delta State University , called emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; he said , He has shot on someone and someone was killed . &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency office that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I turned my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also said that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , who will &quot; &quot; no one will be upset &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the calls for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb has no explanation for its shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could make it und@@ one . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note fell 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ ane Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when he killed him . &quot;
&quot; he told nothing about a conflict between Paul and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that &apos;s supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship , said authorities on Tuesday , they do not give &quot; any information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; three @-@ relationship relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was given by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who spoke out that she had been married approximately seven years as a &quot; &quot; good man &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but were friends . &quot;
&quot; ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and they may be destroyed on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss always were their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , after statement by L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; told that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police told her family at a certain moment on Monday to tell them , &quot; he was not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when police officers moved him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he drove his car to the side , fled to walk , ran into the woods and sle@@ w herself with a shot . &quot;
he received a doc@@ torate in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University as a doc@@ torate on the website of the university .
stars that have lost their luck @-@ story
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner in Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was condemned because of drug owners . &quot;
all this certainly challenges its toll .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play Mon@@ days because of double cargo .
Luke Sha@@ w suffered in the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
&quot; while this has brought the left foreign defen@@ ders to wines , and exp@@ el it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
&quot; the injury was caused by an reck@@ less attack from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V range . &quot;
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has double gar@@ ment and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will move tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it is horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it is happening . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mass .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double question then it will last six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the hanging of a mil@@ limeter .
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
they can judge for themselves when I say a fine @-@ meter and a red map must be payable .
it was a very bad attack on both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws Account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how kap@@ ut I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come more strongly again . &quot;
here@@ on : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during defeat at the PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championships , the England @-@ defen@@ ders has an added incentive for France to recover from the next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is a very terrible injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves this type of injury the place , all are very sad about that . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , when Mexico played against Van ga@@ as Holland for the World Cup in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he does very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and when you hear that there is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu . &quot;
it was not possible for me to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing that I could see was the ball which was on the way in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron is familiar with The Lor@@ ax ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents should learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost mem@@ orized . &quot;
&quot; unless you are , you may be David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; as he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book was decided , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who published in 1971 @-@ published environmental cl@@ am@@ ers of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice for Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Capit@@ s and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a force@@ ful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , as there seems always a picture or a message that we have so far missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron says the story of the book , instead , gives a content indication of the movie version of 2012 that added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , met a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose correct name The@@ odor Se@@ uss @-@ Geis@@ le was lau@@ ded and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; if that was not yet suspected enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is artificial on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; though he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it appears unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the action of book so little . here stops an un@@ ann@@ er@@ ous boy , like the local environment through the monetary gre@@ edy , trees @-@ sn@@ ore , sn@@ ore @-@ bear@@ ers , &quot; who speaks in the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR problem was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax after the other time in a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ person told that the text was probably come by Camer@@ ons &apos;s electoral office .
&quot; Super@@ Capit@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons staff was supplied , but there were no more immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s team , but it is still hard . &quot;
&quot; to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you chose the cad@@ res , the UK selected for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat in my card . &quot;
I would not close an exit point .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the spirit spirit is strong ; they will not wear scars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
here on @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th res@@ igns from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and will be replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; let the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is for me as chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , to analyse it . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that cri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are aimed at results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example ; and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I &apos;ve said this - players can choose their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully strikes out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and that didn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question of how much time a test perc@@ ussion receives , to put his character is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got in front of him , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation to whom one can rise , was that England at first sat in the Caribbean in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in peak , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer who I value high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ aker , which looked at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which made us very much . &quot;
&quot; he has to obtain at least the same chances as those before him , but of course it depends on the team landing in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which would provide an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and get four squ@@ icks , emerged , and I have nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; I do not see why a drummer can not beat there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a hot @-@ shot of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps does not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is not a number 3 for them and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop , before he entered the 2001 as an Open@@ er . &quot;
he immediately made three hundred rit@@ es and looked not back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari arrives in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
people may see their statistics on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a point but there are no large numbers of backup sco@@ oters who rise their hands and the coach has chosen youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few wis@@ h@@ ful additions to the trainers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Com@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experience as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as players or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has prospects of which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the news is in line with the dar@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be inserted at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team @-@ creators do not determine the schedule . &quot;
they must bear in mind that as with the players depend on their jobs from the results .

David Cameron &apos;s un@@ audi@@ ted re@@ traction strategy to keep the UK in the EU will be deeper with every day even without the choice of the ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour and TU@@ C committed because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at ex@@ poses that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from its own guilt , Britain itself has taken an agenda with split cap and bot@@ her@@ ous contract changes , which they usually do not want to fill . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , TU@@ C decided on its annual general meeting that it does not like it if it jeop@@ ardi@@ se social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance ministers at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves facing a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who is looking for an outside Britain in the interior of the EU tent , doesn &apos;t want to see us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets him know that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials have come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the position before it looks bad for her as it has been with the exaggerated long exc@@ es@@ ion such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a pale power .
Poland could soon have a nation@@ alistic right government and Spain a left one .
&quot; it is hard to imagine that she will get a foot out to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s res@@ ignation from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to be , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; as a result , some such ministers may even consider not helpful comments , quite at the SN@@ P @-@ style , during the course of the SN@@ P @-@ style , to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ dge &quot; and &quot; Britain has won &apos;t gained a lot of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how r@@ appro@@ pi@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press @-@ bar@@ one as they did during the referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n inspired , but who joined our admission in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro Opport@@ un@@ ists , who made a name for himself as an &apos; EU Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &apos; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ ies . &quot;
with all his de@@ ity I knew Ed Mili@@ band , who had his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing @-@ sw@@ ells , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing aliens and the pseudo @-@ in@@ countries , who own most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually , Tony Blair actually thought about it , but created that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage allowing better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him , rather than to become a lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ an@@ dic than Blair himself , when he denoun@@ ced Mr. Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Blair was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 which opened their door door . &quot;
the press has never denied that .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me some friendly cl@@ aps on the back in Westminster yesterday - I told him that he would not have time for me to delay boy@@ cott of Mur@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ doch Mur@@ a strategy of 80 @-@ s years , an error at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ couch he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps and traditional bl@@ us@@ pr@@ it tendency and the wil@@ der of tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes to that yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; a Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said , when the sc@@ outs in it strug@@ gled , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of provo@@ ke John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s years , when his old father devoted himself to his leadership to his Labour government , without going to go too far and to lose his cabinet . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , in order to &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; in all circumstances - Ben@@ ns &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told its sympathy and parliament@@ arians to all reports on their presentation on Monday night . &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the ma@@ el@@ strom of social media , a breeding @-@ site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in campaign free of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell It said . &quot;
Simon Jen@@ kins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s major ambig@@ u@@ ities - in line with its Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ us economy - its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric representation of lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents as a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
&quot; like with its ambig@@ u@@ ities , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to res@@ ignation - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin squ@@ ander political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make com@@ promises to the British , if all this can be useless ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday of something which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts are critical of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; allegations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined The Lanc@@ et , by critic@@ ise the principles used by Public Health England ( phe ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
orph@@ ous published the &quot; primary report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial written in the medical journal The Lanc@@ et last month picked up the &quot; &quot; extraordinary win@@ dy base &quot; , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the cont@@ en@@ tions are built on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proving of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the general public is expected to say that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking , &quot; based on a detailed verification of references and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ level criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to guide their opinions about the damage of various nicotine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told that a Sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director has previously received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T on Public Health in a Sustainability Report , told them . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting agreed to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the funding he has received after reports before the Tab@@ ak@@ company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the body are not supplied , but they include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champion , some of which also include a branch of sectors in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco management took part .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; ingly , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard mo@@ ons for the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , no such connections or limitations in the electr@@ o @-@ report will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told that &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no evidence that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes can be used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at bran , said that the allegations of BM@@ J was previously responded to . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking .
every second life @-@ long smoking dies in its addiction .
any evidence suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are low but that we continue to have long term effects to study .
&quot; moreover , the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence is eviden@@ ced and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative risks compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0.000 people annually die of a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking is the national health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear pres@@ sions of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national responsibility . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up the East@@ er@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &apos; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent through other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making them public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time window , against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director Tony Hall , I said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he has tried to contact the BBC for six years at his time with Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC has been ordered on behalf of BBC , which also clearly demonstrated by non @-@ subsidi@@ tion@@ alist ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications Committee under his investigation into the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to hold the broad@@ casting fee , what I think in medium or long @-@ term is not for a good idea , one should at least do its production on programs that others do not do or in order . &quot;
&quot; send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous ; it is natural . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs could be financed , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another example , admittedly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business builder for series , has directed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews was &quot; due to the ambitions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC indicate what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ tag@@ onal presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ischen programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where they can quite do not measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
&quot; they put them in a window of time , in which no one ever wanted to see them . &quot;
&quot; on the broad@@ casting fee , Johnson said to the committee &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions you can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think that one gets a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , I wonder if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also spoke before the Committee on Tuesday , urged that the BBC should review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educate and entertain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only few of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example to &quot; &quot; Find out &quot; &quot; in public @-@ legal broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of on television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ band Alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Get &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
&quot; the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they will be stre@@ amed with sound impulses . &quot;
scientists have cultivated wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems which can be controlled by cut@@ ters of sound @-@ waves .
&quot; the tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction of the moment in which they treated with sound impulses , which have become too high frequencies for the human hearing . &quot;
pul@@ ses work by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ on cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that are responding to ultrasound waves .
more to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ Review , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ e@@ kan@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the proceedings of one day could replace the depths of the stimulation of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease symptoms . &quot;
claims are generally not responding to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani also stated that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultrasound waves , which penetrate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the enhanced ultrasound waves act on structures that TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ gs are called and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
&quot; sound waves show the opening of these ion channels and enable the cells to be associated with , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , genetically modified c@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ ility and TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels bear . &quot;
&quot; when it turns out on the changed creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fying by the micro@@ b@@ ans and transfer into the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed engines . &quot;
&quot; the process has some similarities with op@@ to@@ Sizegenetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool , the scientist allows , neur@@ ons with impulses of light and turn off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light being sent to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound tissues can pass through freely and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with genital therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the ti@@ led human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in school residence
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ter 19 @-@ year olds in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral tur@@ ati@@ vis@@ m ; but only now I remember the tense smile that I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ vo@@ iced complaints about others . &quot;
most of the things that I learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the cleaning of the student dormit@@ ory is from slightly nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely scary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to vibr@@ ating : people tell you where you come , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ Year where you are neither loving nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extra@@ kt Ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out people that you like unlike those with which you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your lashes were ra@@ ging in fire and this fire@@ proof would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people of people often turn into beverages as their recipes , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in this case , do not think about stopping at the Un@@ i with a relationship &quot;
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ tically received a crude treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many school residences are a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture , which can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be the hell for someone who tried to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go , but you have to go away , so that I keep the energy back I used for interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a being a plot of convi@@ vi@@ ality has been exhausted , and send him an SMS instead . &quot;
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an invitation was not a closed door .
he saw some things .
friendship close through B@@ aking .
&quot; as you start the un@@ i at the height of the back @-@ Man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of men to imagine them with a plate full of browsers , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ ers &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to bake . so , and now please smile if I provide you with some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to entertain yourself and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; cl@@ ums@@ y l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat led to them that people sleep asleep , when you anchor . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in school residence .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a rob@@ bery , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check it with the mil@@ k@@ owner .
&quot; the odds are good , they say to serve themselves , even if they are bo@@ il in the inner . &quot;
&quot; when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with this well @-@ balanced as my room@@ mate , who will add your milk into a soap to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise the people from sleep or from work stops .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that you belong to the people in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b that sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something , drum and bass somewhat le@@ qui@@ eter , because it had three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they reacted to this with much more loud music .
&quot; when they finally heard about 5 pm , their neighbours were kindly allowed to sleep two hours before they shut their own music , shut their door shut and went to her three @-@ hour exam . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would enter into the same dor@@ m dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; it would not be very deeply embarrassing for you to keep a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , join them again and then have to see them every day and maybe along the way they bring all common friends to themselves ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot @-@ room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that somebody has left his keys in his un@@ veiled room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and Bul@@ lying is one as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good battle is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
grab a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but if you never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but you waste your possessions on the ceiling not more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terr@@ aced houses for refugees , single @-@ extrac@@ tors , t@@ all@@ ists &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ es builds the Eck@@ ental terr@@ aced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for about refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the righteous for@@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how you can still work well today and well , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ es believes to know how rapidly cheaper space can be created : he builds on a project town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ es , many refugees are ur@@ ri@@ dges to the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or sne@@ ak@@ age has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we need plenty of living room during the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a whole , three @-@ storey house @-@ house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs least more space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when people under@@ mine people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses that are being built precisely in the pilot project , consists of three residential units of each of four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be re@@ arranged easily according to the needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ es : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is spread over 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction has taken .
this is reasonable .
do the builders have their plans complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : &quot; legally I have carried out my project correctly .
particularly complicated it is always the im@@ min@@ ent Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ ist special @-@ building and the adju@@ sting ordin@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ put , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the local inhabitants react to their town@@ house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who threw me down to create luxury farm@@ houses for asylum seekers .
which definitely is not true .
but tigh@@ ten not ag@@ grav@@ ate the extreme fight for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true that &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but they were built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need a living room . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother and the righteous for@@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
I am showing how to make use of cheap and well @-@ established today .
that is why it goes .

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the set @-@ up app , typ@@ ing into &quot; general &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install inst@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; some are pushed after the installation to problems , as they get an error message informing you that the &quot; &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush is going back or trying to update on iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; that may mean the d@@ ele@@ tion of apps to create room - but Apple has made this more likely through the screw@@ driving of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued because the phone might turn off half way and lead this to a down@@ turn of the updates . &quot;

men investig@@ ators on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans a
&quot; witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , against 23.@@ 45 , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in direction of Sal@@ oral . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police their two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them that they might wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was at the height of the B@@ FT station .
on the premises of the gas station also three persons were held .
&quot; one of these men cried out to the young people , and struck them up with the fist . &quot;
&quot; the victim is suffering from this , and hem@@ med heavily from the nose . &quot;
&quot; when his two friends found cre@@ ed and invited to the bat , they took first out of his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now being taken home . &quot;
the cul@@ pr@@ er followed the group with a passenger up to the apartment and drove a number of demonstrations over there .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
under aid of a tum@@ ult you pointed to the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured man had to be hospital care in a hospital .
&quot; so far , there is only a v@@ ague tat@@ too . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of Fel@@ ste@@ ing in Germany and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ence .
&quot; in addition , Sam@@ ba @-@ headed by Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economics of the U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
doctors are missing in many places in the countryside - A@@ sen@@ dorf and she &apos;s lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in Fel@@ ence on October 1st .
&quot; while SE@@ L Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is reti@@ ring in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing on his successor during the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ construction phase , Müller opens the practice again on October 12 , until then he will be investing 3@@ 10000 Euros in the premises on the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; sympathy came out at first glance , when I met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completed their studies of medical education at the Pro@@ pos@@ ing Hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ res@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I simply called them . &quot;
couple Mu@@ eller got the idea of operating the original practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and the continuous contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to experience and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he can also soon be his own boss . &quot;
and so one was agreed that the Mü@@ llers are buying the house with the practice .
live they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time Family father Frank Müller grew up , also raised in his medicine studies in Hannover , offices in several medical offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Neu@@ ch@@ â@@ tel . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a leader in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed a senior doctor in the district Die@@ ph@@ ol@@ z and joined as a volunteer in DR@@ K &apos;s readiness to Bru@@ ch@@ hausen . &quot;
&quot; from 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Field c@@ ab , his wife has specialised in the gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ts , want to take care of themselves as house in@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations and long @-@ term and @-@ term @-@ keeping @-@ up and need a one @-@ speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , the Mü@@ llers are granted within the context of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ istr@@ al @-@ Champion Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients are coming to practice , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , every quarter in the practice Fel@@ ence , in the North German average practice , are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store will count according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ res@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it would have gone .
who visits Mü@@ llers is by the way also especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical journals and cleaning power from the field ste@@ aling .
&quot; with its departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medi@@ cs have been practi@@ sed for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ h@@ mun@@ e . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness felt they after the long time already .
&quot; but we live on in Hohen@@ moor and many patients are certainly still seeing , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; your husband is comple@@ mented , &quot; we have a 6,000 sqm plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed ahead of gardening , so that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grandchildren and willing to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls are also high on our border line , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in parallel , the controls on the Hungarian border remain a common cause . &quot;
&quot; still it is clear that anyone who wants to make a refugee entry , that &apos;s also of course . &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear that clear signals needed , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , not via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is den@@ oted &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously communicated , Slovenia wants to leave Slovenia to the coming refugees towards Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , cor@@ ridors for the refugees were established . &quot;
&quot; all of this , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; rather to intensify the surveillance of the borders - especially to Hungary - to intensify . &quot;
the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled at the border of the Schengen area .
&quot; like the Minister , Slovenia wants to fight its borders for refugees but not to spro@@ uting . &quot;
&quot; each member of the EU member must complete its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ g@@ ur Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like Croatian government , the first refugees would have already tried to travel in eastern Croatian hours on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ari@@ nik / Si@@ d . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack it in the nearby ma@@ is@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , since that time in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and its new refugees meet new refugees . &quot;
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
also life@@ guard and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the days ahead , his country with around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo would be transferred to the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had previously expressed refugees to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , tends to make it possible to make certain routes : &quot; neither we can nor do we want it , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus arrived with approximately 50 refugees to the Ser@@ b border , in the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were on the way around 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police told us that we are to drive here , &quot; one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this way it could actually be joined to observers in the Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west part .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for Border checks
Croatia &apos;s interior minister of East @-@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible eradic@@ ation of refugees .
&quot; he did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia was called non @-@ Schengen &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
follow strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , since 2007 the EU @-@ partner has consistently delivered a good testimony to the country in terms of standards of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , there are about 300 refugees driving on the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reporting , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border transi@@ tions of Hor@@ gos and B@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now want to continue travelling to the Croatian border is not yet unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic was trying to calm an early afternoon at a local moment in Hor@@ gos : it is the debate about aging of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , premature . &quot;
it would not currently be a great deal of refugees .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute land maps that alternative routes are shown in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war that still does not under@@ mine min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of de@@ mining was sent in the border region .

&quot; according to this manner , investig@@ ators received a total of over 100 million dollars . &quot;

ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ cul@@ ation Mannheim has been around for 20 years
all around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ que is now in operation .
&quot; the people have their concerns , some short pac@@ em@@ aker , partially jo@@ ck@@ ling . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons on the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city railways .
&quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ istine life with beautiful autumn sun@@ shine and middle @-@ inside four large tables each with the heading &quot; Be@@ fore I die . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ om@@ ission took note of this action to its 20 year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it is about life , therefore we are dealing with the action in the midst of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the conduc@@ tivity of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ian Hosp@@ iz@@ ers is available for questions and discussions as well as our volunteers .
&quot; while some Pass@@ ant inv@@ ading the chal@@ k and got the proposition for &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; with the camper going through the US , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not long &quot; &quot; supplements to read , say sets like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go further . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the edge , small discussions about the action on themselves , about life , dealing with the death . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is currently on site .
&quot; only when I make it clear that for me eventually the end of this world comes , I can live ir@@ responsible , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onischen Werkes Mannheim , who is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ cer@@ er of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate with the tables , however , be understandable , finally it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying is still aff@@ licted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer , even though the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has contributed much to the people to open . &quot;
one app@@ rais@@ al , the an@@ ika Go@@ on &apos;s shares . &quot;
the death and funeral of this funeral is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; in personal experience dealing with the topic , they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; if the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ om@@ b was asked by a call for volunteers , I immediately reported it and had been with the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ solid is owned by a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - that concerned the sufferers and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z St. Vincent . &quot;
all are they carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ def@@ and@@ roid is good to cope with her job and his experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ rior , consider it hard for precious and value the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the range of out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ es are free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
&quot; the financial support of the sickness funds and donations of members and associations allows the training , as well as further education and super@@ visions of the eu@@ than@@ - and funeral guides . &quot;
every two years training courses are offered for new employees .
&quot; the plates described on Saturday are now in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) , and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , further personal wishes can be noted on post@@ cards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result was mixed with financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports not dis@@ appoint results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his prize @-@ looking for a whole year because of the weak@@ est demand for cargo services and higher costs at its bo@@ oting service .
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to cancel 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the stock fell by 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. spoke to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent lower than in the previous pre@@ diction . &quot;
analy@@ st expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increase , average of 4.@@ 9 percent and on 4 January are effective , despite higher points for bo@@ ast transport of heavy and large packages , which are collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expect the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online commerce . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; solid yields &quot; &quot; to consider the weaker and expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , which plans to put 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research and asked analysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six by Z@@ acks asked analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a drop in international pri@@ mor@@ als shipping that brought sales to st@@ agn@@ ate in his unity express registration .
but the boom in online shopping made the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales at the Bod@@ nik rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher cost of higher packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit posted higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result declined because of higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; for market trading , approximately one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares re@@ turn@@ around € 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent on a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated meeting in the years Federal Reserve B@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table sitting down to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time in nearly a decade to lift the console . &quot;
&quot; on them , on them at the end of the discounted , two @-@ stor@@ eyed seat sa@@ wing is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
&quot; the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ et , and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things . &quot;
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an uns@@ ha@@ unting third mandate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate would be the X factor in a decision that is too tight in order to pre@@ dict them . on Thursday it is announced , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be re@@ kind@@ led by the un@@ parall@@ eled incentive for the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data from the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ences to the global financial markets could be cautious so far as pru@@ dent F@@ ed represent@@ ants to strengthen these volati@@ lity in the increase of interest on Bundes@@ an@@ bor@@ o - and be it just a quarter of the percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is first and foremost the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief econom@@ ists in the Mak@@ ler@@ ette Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were searching for an excuse to not increase the interest rate , the increased insecurity around the global market is enough justification , continue to wait &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , what is uncertain in itself to the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted an interest @-@ making this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets expect a lowering of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists are l@@ essen the blow because they promise that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average is up to 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or to 1,4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations , that the F@@ ed @-@ policy remains the sentence during this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Executive Officer at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go far too far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic in panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts ar@@ gues that a fight against financial markets would calm the financial markets , because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; just a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.1 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the monetary conditions that would test the recovery of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ uts had said in spring and in early summer , that despite the complaints by Liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase of a proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improving on the labour market this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank at 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage rates have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation continued under the end of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed represent@@ ants told that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them on the labour market because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Apostle at the Pantheon &apos;s Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets appeared together around the world at the end of the last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage in May fell by more than 16 % under its peak , as investors afraid that the Chinese economy would reduce the global growth of the Chinese economy . &quot;
&quot; in this month , the market reco@@ vers something in this month , the Dow is now almost 10 % below the ho@@ m of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al influence the complex calculation , when to increase the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy has not occurred in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
he tells us that they will wait at least a month to better get a grip on .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the world economy is just one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision making . &quot;
&quot; but , in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authorities of the world has become . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere remark of the then statement of Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; for@@ en@@ ching their monetary expansion &quot; , &quot; solve con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are becoming increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can only be monitored by the F@@ ed representatives but also advised by other central banks and experts to ensure a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary car@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for assets management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ acker , co @-@ legitim@@ ated member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocates the role of interest @-@ making , rec@@ alled decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark results in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place some aspects of financial stability , only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crisis , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence come not close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest @-@ making , because the markets become exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still lacks the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think they should hurry ahead of time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany in Germany .
welcome to prepare a warm welcome we do not work without the dedication of innum@@ erable volunteer don@@ ors .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are quite a lot of people who are un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also with their 74 L@@ enz@@ es they are still happy to instruc@@ t .
every Thursday she is doing it in asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very different lesson than in the right school . &quot;
&quot; Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande , promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding . &quot;
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to explain how important good nutrition during the breastfeeding period is . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that are suffering from breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods .
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies provide all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually concerns the genetics of their babies and protecting them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
unfortunately an unhealthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the local council Bern@@ ried authorized the construction price for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed to fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around of the sport grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent u@@ der@@ ate meeting the pronounced construction of the employment was revealed without great discussions .
&quot; previously , the body had decided upon another application for a structural &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; exception , &quot; it was the permission for a special design regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof @-@ roof &quot; &quot; should be built with non @-@ depth First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; background of planning is the intended use of the attic for solar generators : &quot; &quot; we get together a wonderfully large southern part , &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; in turn went in to the attic , which is required for energy reasons - unlike a construction plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan in relation to the attic are no &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereas the amber of the community in general goes more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a common project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the expense of some 2.3 million euros are calculated .
grants are expected by the school and grass@@ roots support .
&quot; in the next process of procedur@@ al progress , the grant for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now being submitted to the government office for testing . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of staff pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is what they see their amazing plans of the hospital GmbH of the di@@ ac , confir@@ ming the Coun@@ cils of Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot;
&quot; the Supervisory Board will make a decision about the Supervisory Board , and the meeting next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are put into practice , all of the nearly 50 employees in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue . &quot;
the vast majority should be converted with fishermen and the next ones within the station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who cannot cope with to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about their plans .
&quot; it has triggered the change of cancellation by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been at the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic before the beginning of the year , and now turns to a private practice in immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to compete , came to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who was ready to take on the line from the 1st of October and to exchange with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this would be a &quot; upgrading &quot; and a distribution of the offering in the field &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; such as Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the inner station on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ ance to the next two years , fishermen are expected to agree with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree both houses , until then the former hospital in the workforce , which has more than 35 beds , will be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the County had planned this for 2018 , as the currently ongoing renovation work at the hospital of Wei@@ l@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ chner @-@ White , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came out rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal law , should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; the end I leave . &quot; as it continues with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ light psych@@ ic .
&quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ um could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; Fischer said about the Qu@@ asi @-@ moving to the Le@@ ch , who has been accepted by the staff &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been working as a leader for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened in the last decades by close , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

two tra@@ ine@@ ers have been severely injured during their corn harvesting on the service afternoon through shots .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion at a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( County of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , like the police . &quot;
&quot; after a swe@@ dish , a 63@@ th and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injury and were brought into hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , it was initially unclear . &quot;
the crime police are determined .
mixed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence
an animal susp@@ icious has led the police into the body of the year @-@ old 16 @-@ year olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , the young people killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate has fallen victim to a victim of violence since Saturday .
&quot; the Lei@@ che of the young woman was found at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , as pro@@ secutor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ too , one also recorded on Tuesday evening recorded 20 @-@ year @-@ old who , in fact , carried out the report , and investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had already been missed on Sunday morning after they did not arrive at home on the eve of an autumn ceremony in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman investig@@ ators took the investig@@ ators to personal belon@@ gings of the victim .
&quot; in surveys in friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the def@@ endant , finally , there was a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the j@@ ump@@ tuous cul@@ pr@@ its then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; the party was alleged to have killed the authorities in the police force , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the bodies were put into the canal . &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday to the pro@@ pon@@ ent ; the investig@@ ators lay hold of his death .

refugees need accommodation : study of housing at housing
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid place .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
distribution struggles at the German residential market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and working seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many cities . &quot;
they compete with a weak minded people around the final affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , it would have to be built into 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this result is a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; meeting . &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year , a total of 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; hence , there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees have no longer committed to live as asylum seekers in a first residence . &quot;
many come across the flat market and join the long queu@@ es from flat rentals .
&quot; according to the Federal Office of the Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers came to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative trend in the housing market does not only lie in the rising refugee figures . &quot;
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany sho@@ ving a house deficit from year to year , getting bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; at present , in the metropolitan areas already approximately 77@@ ,000 units , su@@ ed Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals have therefore lived in large cities in W@@ G @-@ rooms .
&quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; because of the F@@ lu@@ te on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; during the large cities , the number of square meter per capita in the past years has fallen back again . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; strikes a new start . &quot;
the new incentives for the social housing should be accelerated .
this way could be avoided on the land transfer tax and will be exposed to the basic tax for funded apartments .
&quot; in addition , the alliance can be attractive tax @-@ sil@@ encing capabilities . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee camps at the State Bank Kf@@ W is already working well in cities and villages .
&quot; a good week after the launch was already more than half the total amount of EUR 300 million available at the Monday night , with 18@@ 4 million Euros . &quot;
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free parking : Croatia and Slovenia to set up a corridor
&quot; there is practically no escape to Hungary , as more and more refugees pick up their way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that the transit of Slovenia to the North with no hur@@ dles meant .
but the route is dangerous at all .
Croatia wants to leave Slovenia with the neighbouring countries of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik on the Croatian Highway RT@@ L .
Hungary had no border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , do virtually su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous asylum proceedings in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border with Serbia . &quot;
&quot; most of them were reported to media reporting according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came to the bus as well as in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
refugees were not at the border f@@ ences on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
&quot; instead , the border strip contains other dangers : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ de@@ dness should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closing of the border , no more refugees arrive after Hungary . &quot;
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 @-@ term people .
shortly before the gate on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws levels overcome the bor@@ row and damage of the bor@@ row as a crime .
&quot; in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were therefore to be introduced . &quot;
sentenced to five years and deportation from the country to five years .
&quot; according to the immigration authority on Tuesday , one took on Tuesday to the new &quot; tran@@ sit@@ ing &quot; border on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - most important crossing r@@ ös@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
there will be 40 refugees on Wednesday morning .
&quot; however , no one has a prospect granted for asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe Third World &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the distr@@ acted asylum seekers are to be raised there .
&quot; before the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke people gathered only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke started to regulate workers with it .
&quot; they gathered in the trash one , which left tens of thousands of people over the past weeks at the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ y@@ wall screens have been eliminated and one of the c@@ ots in the bor@@ der@@ place has been modified .
&quot; to the aim of this re@@ building , nobody wanted to express itself . &quot;
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , there are only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants stood still in the country , but still in the country . &quot;
about 1400 persons are waiting for the trip to Germany in Salzburg .
in the morning the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities .
regular groups of refugees regularly met smaller groups of refugees .
Mayor was driving &quot; cross @-@ border &quot; over the border
&quot; we were engaged after the bridge firm on Sunday with the elevator , when suddenly ten people with travel providers at the entrance of the tent were , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein @-@ one Mayor Alois City . &quot;
tourists always wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
&quot; because Germany had expected the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , but for her in W@@ ern@@ stein , the urban train station , who immediately offered his help and the str@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the N@@ ahe Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we had once had the hoped @-@ hoped for guests to have had with rop@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; says the town@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take to pass a generous donation - 100 euros for fire bri@@ ga@@ des .
&quot; this was very much appreciated by the city . &quot;
&quot; the passengers of the passengers were killed on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train in direction of Pass@@ au , to make it difficult after the notice that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany but still to try the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was ab@@ rog@@ ated before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ crossing generally is high in the course .
&quot; the Br@@ ücken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbors on Sunday ro@@ am soci@@ ably , days before a two @-@ full @-@ cycle - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends another Z@@ ig@@ th to us , is a logical result of a apparent policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than help in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help build structures that human@@ eness provide , our Federal Republic has turned the official position and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government in the ranks of National Socialism . &quot;
suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with chaotic states now .
&quot; the p@@ oul@@ ders will have to determine that the &quot; borrowed country &quot; &quot; they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the end of the winter we have to make decent conditions for protective seekers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees that arrived on Monday to Austria be accomplished without the big vor@@ tex , &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; master work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the cour@@ ty@@ ards spoke of a &quot; &quot; crisis situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , Konrad Adenauer expects a need of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ting in the last year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfill the number we must be able to find 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the coming weeks - 20,000 the countries are willing to provide 15,000 children . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the governor he has already conducted conversations .
&quot; these would have secured him , as well as for the coming refugees to create qui@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow will there be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby it is necessary to explain how the church will help . &quot;
&quot; large expectations put the asylum @-@ ordinator as well as the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps &quot; &quot; as we do . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodations . &quot;
one can also hope for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in times of need , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ sans have to respect a certain amount of the manuals or size of the upper country . &quot;
for a fixed time would have to apply &quot; emergency standards . &quot;
&quot; that he was more successful in the place of the Interior concerning the accommodation , Konrad Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentleman , who cannot without further face the fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;
belief force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic no cost as they declared themselves .
their staff will want to increase it on three or four .
the mother &apos;s own tran@@ sit@@ ter has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz in the office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; only the opening of the city halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for accommodations of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; at the moment this is not necessary , as people currently can accommodate these measures without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
for emergen@@ cies but more locations are to be tested for their adequ@@ acy .
a critical review of the city &apos;s residence on the division of refugees within the state .
other regions have to do their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not cut off &quot;
in a longer telephone line with the Bav@@ arian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) has consolidated the company &apos;s full action in the refugee population on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ass@@ ures me that the German borders will not be cut off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is also possible .
&quot; yet , there is just the corresponding border controls . &quot;
special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
but the seekers would have been brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee population . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria also leads to controls on its limits , is for ag@@ it@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a matter of time
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; link in the Lin@@ zer industry is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production buildings the exchange of the exchange office group S &amp; T moved , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) should be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in star@@ tup companies of the new ship@@ yard and later also app@@ raise which to match .
&quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which , Nieder@@ du@@ es promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is only a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the centre , € 3.@@ 3 million from the Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is hosted by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meter doors in the building are rented out , for a further 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ress opened second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the center .
actually J@@ utta wanted to adopt a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ cher by Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ ign @-@ ar@@ ade short@@ cut and finally she has now getting tri@@ wax in the form of another business location .
&quot; sold in the Fur@@ la shop over the business , in which they sold under others bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and gar@@ b of different manufacturers , now everything is about Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags in the Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are available from 75 Euro . &quot;
&quot; bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop has been in operation . &quot;
previously has been modified several weeks before .
&quot; but I survived , if I want to open a store for a long time , &quot; says wide . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of its own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the single in Greater Linz to sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion show is wide placed by her mother to the cradle .
&quot; I &apos;m most likely , when something developed and I can show new trends for high @-@ performance prices . &quot;
&quot; why so some woman in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tr@@ ap@@ ture det@@ ector , the woman can not be answered with last security . &quot;
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded to any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ makers from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are called an@@ alogues . &quot;
this feature bin@@ ars some also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether it is foreign or xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists or kno@@ wers be revealed in the international crisis policy - the applicant fores@@ had@@ ows his election in favour of the US presidential election . &quot;
and it cuts off on well .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the real estate industry desc@@ ended . &quot;
the New Yorker with the bo@@ oming hair@@ dres@@ ser is on the wine road many in the wine region .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is related to -@@ sixty corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign mode . &quot;
the Simone Wen@@ del tw@@ isted a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; and what do villagers think about his goal , become the most powerful man in the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think that somehow you find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; a native speaker , made a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous Spr@@ int , to which besides Tr@@ ump , the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; the ump , which is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he certainly would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tended to say that &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; is a bit a great w@@ alled &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; by chance , the nickname , the k@@ all@@ stadt in the district , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - in high @-@ tone : the len@@ ders , she says . &quot;
&quot; thus , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the Gi@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the US opened a pub for the min@@ er . &quot;
foundation of the real estate concept was the first real estate in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy , her desire to return to the homeland over the long run , was part of the Bav@@ arian State , which was part of the Palat@@ inate at that time . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t have absorbed Tr@@ ump because he was once saved without a permit , the director of the Institute of Ga@@ el@@ ic History and Folklore , Roland Paul , explains to the film . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the desc@@ endant .
this has repeatedly been p@@ onder@@ ing over Mexican immigrants in the United States and requ@@ esting the construction of a border property to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ ls , this is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives ( &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ ancing . &quot; he is always so short @-@ temper@@ ed .
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; that I can not imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of any city .
&quot; the Pen@@ si@@ ka Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm mentioned as man@@ tra K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a post@@ age of the family Heinz lived with a visit to something for the church organ , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; that I cannot imagine of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they did it better if he won &apos;t miss the choice because &quot; &quot; there is such a radical view , I do not know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the USA at the time of his grandfather , would have been as he did , he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ asts Sarah stages . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not so , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , which was interviewed for the Tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 kin@@ og@@ am@@ ers , but also in the USA the interest is awakened . &quot;
the Upper Bav@@ arian community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; min@@ stre@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; from the president of the Vice @-@ President of the German Alpine Club ( German Alpine Club ) , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , 1800 @-@ inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park , received the award for gentle tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering &quot; villages .
&quot; in the neighboring country , the Austrian Alps association is responsible for the award of the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain sti@@ ck@@ dorf &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ f of the Do@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently un@@ wit@@ ted father , which decides to settle with his two children of New Zealand , reaching a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son got a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L &quot; &quot; ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 ) from the new Quiz Show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ K@@ ee@@ fe emerged on average 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 6 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday night , the first half hour was recorded by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will also hope@@ ful that Hot @-@ Se@@ at eventually will win at 17 : 30 . &quot;

&quot; the final three agree : Bachelor of Sam , is the perfect man - but who will he choose ? &quot;
un@@ veiled secret ? ...
&quot; Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have un@@ know@@ ingly un@@ know@@ ingly , who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood landed at The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was wrapped up in the greatest secret . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they are the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ low on the day before coming out three two , you might have accidentally put an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues its lips to be sealed on Thursday
&quot; all three women are om@@ itted on a ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and ex@@ poses his sense of humor , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was supposed to receive the last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the per@@ dition become who the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki bel@@ lows both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood continues to have a simple relationship with one another on the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ was ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; he added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be as a pair well .
&quot; from their perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week was clear to her that wood is &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and my family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I now have un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose between Wood , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ loved girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lan@@ a .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten @-@ Line . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the USA - and there were many other teams seeking to send requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise choice .
&quot; some coaches were rel@@ eg@@ ated Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a bar@@ gain , as it did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Conver@@ ti@@ t in his first Pun@@ t @-@ return on Tuesday when he was 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man , and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to return a Pun@@ t @-@ return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the match .
&quot; instead of taking over his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; also , Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne on his press conference again in his press conference . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ ad@@ porter In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams co @-@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ dden to catch his scrat@@ ched catch and care about the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ rolled at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ enn@@ ese . &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian explor@@ atory had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and told later the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne all@@ ot@@ ted the car@@ ver with his Ori@@ gin debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al region led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; leader of the Party and leader of Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn migration at the big crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1,000 extra teachers to keep the schools before collapse &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get con@@ vul@@ sions in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Sunday collection of the Free voters bu@@ ds to Friday in the fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually the other main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees also dominates the Free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; naturally , the subject of asylum is covered by the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they did during the Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it goes on , we need to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the Free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; so Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative authorities that are responsible for asylum : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new Asyl@@ um &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W chief critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; we were nationwide federal standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bayern sli@@ me off , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to be able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics should not fall under the table in big wheels .
a long @-@ long run of continuous burner remains on the agenda : the policy of the image .
&quot; for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ Minister Ludwig Pl@@ aces ( CS@@ U ) started in 47 g@@ ymnasi@@ ums from three to four years , with an extension of the grammar school of three to four years - the result will last nine years until the finish . &quot;
but that is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ as@@ tics who want to do this .
&quot; free drive at G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired . &quot;
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
the German stock market has closed after an over @-@ wide routes of ground @-@ free and nervous trade @-@ course with threads .
&quot; only in the afternoon a fes@@ tering pr@@ el@@ ude of the US market could be a clear direction that the D@@ ax was ultimately reduced by 0.@@ 56 percent to EUR 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points . &quot;

&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones @-@ Index last around 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
&quot; many Bo@@ si@@ ders expect the markets to take place on this Friday , even after the interest decision powers in the US and to the large decline . &quot;
the discussion about the loads from the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has made the stock of RW@@ E temporarily on a record and also inhi@@ bit deep marks at eon .
&quot; according to the &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; no 30 billion euros are missing in the German energy divisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied any figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered somewhat , but it ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) . &quot;
&quot; Infin@@ eon shares rose by a further 3,@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax tip . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the U.S. &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &quot; &quot; magazine took place from the weekend . &quot;

the papers of the highways Daimler and BMW used by 1.@@ 34 per cent or 2.@@ 21 percent .
Volkswagen advantages exp@@ elled by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German retirement market the operating on loans were reduced to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the pension index Rex rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the euro decreased in the afternoon to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
&quot; against mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate of 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;

4 people killed after poli@@ c@@ emen work on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal .
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police explo@@ ded rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd of men who spoke against the proposed new constitution said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke down in the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Financial Officer , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters gathered outside of a police station , with some of you throwing stones and sl@@ bom@@ bed . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used trou@@ gh@@ ur@@ as and then shot up into the air before they dropped on rubber .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the employed rubber bul@@ lets known that they may be killing , but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the examination was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as Southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of ma@@ dro@@ i say that new provinces , which were formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ itz family who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been in violent conflicts since the decade . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties have signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution since 2008 has been on its way , but legislation accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislation voted on certain cl@@ auses in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ der Youth Centre Alte Post is scheduled to rebuild .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; planned is a mix of trade , commercial and housing - but there is not yet concrete offers . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meters large plot in direct vicinity to the Art Museum of Ancient Post .
the preparations for this are currently running .
&quot; planned to use the terrain for a blend of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate promotions , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor desire to question is still not clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner Grand Street , just a few months ago and can tear the town located to it . &quot;
project H@@ ie@@ ve : details are on the table
the plans for holiday in the little sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ lie@@ ger are more troubled - they fear selling their leisure market
&quot; T.@@ T.@@ I. has been p@@ onder@@ ing behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ing , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday in the little sea are near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized em@@ powered institution of &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; presented their plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Stadt@@ Stadt@@ Stadt@@ Labor Committee , for the first time . &quot;
originally that point was standing on the non @-@ public part of the day .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , those of the investor and administration of secrecy , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went from the System @-@ Bau @-@ Management to the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
&quot; yet , it is good to be able to deal with all the rum@@ ors now . &quot;
&quot; for months now , the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; fierce reactions among sea land@@ owners , who had come to the meeting , gre@@ aves the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ land@@ owner and board member in the syndic@@ ate of the An@@ lie@@ ger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ained : &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ tops all other containers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he feared a number of other project critics that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase greatly : &quot; &quot; there are all bus numbers so that counts , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well one h@@ ect@@ are of the old restaurant , is however still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; first of all we have to have a logical concept , &quot; he said to Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
because this was still missing but also the development plans were still variable .

Google starts re@@ dou@@ bling action campaign to earn 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign that will aid 11 million $ in humanitarian organisations , who will aid the thousands of refugees who su@@ ck the European Nations as they flee from the war and flee countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to posting the donations on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting one manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google co @-@ worker who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip belonged to many dark rail and bus trips , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants grew out in Europe , many people as my family are des@@ perate for help . &quot;
&quot; donations are made available to four charitable organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , international Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million in Goo@@ .com / or low to $ 11 million .

coverage from Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easy overweight diabe@@ tics can be helpful and surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for a minimum of five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easy overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery are longer living than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert on the weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial written to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrition .
&quot; over the years adi@@ posit@@ as operations have been proven to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies were conducted with people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that somebody is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that have collected them since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity , stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ tis - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those that undergo this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who are subjected to surgical procedure , they del@@ etes in 36 % of the diabetes disease completely and in case of 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared to the diabetes @-@ treated group , the diabetes is completely only at one percent and in part at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results were found in controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in general , better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitoring the patient &apos;s blood level by hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , writing the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c declined by some 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved v@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - does not decrease the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
&quot; the research team also tested average results among the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger returns in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 % vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study has no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was subject to obes@@ e people , who undergo an obesity operation , about 29 per cent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring to persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without having higher risk of death or kidney illness . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors are beginning to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we do people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , conversion is really difficult . &quot;
love @-@ history plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is currently being noted in the fic@@ ic@@ tion of fiction : a young woman , too school times un@@ loved and un@@ sigh@@ tly , after years she meets the flock of her youth and she fell in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tually , we are not so &quot; of Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück ( s ) , as it plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional writer has grown up in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and was delighted that she was able to set a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide urged to stop the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of prolonged refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford with ethics and studies .
he called for sure that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of each nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is admir@@ able in the refugee crisis , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there is only temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as genuine peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s action after the terror attack on September 11 and presented that the US violent reaction of the U.S. attracted a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; after the 11th September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to resolving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put an authority , and this has start@@ led consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold rise of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; po@@ ft@@ ment centers in the U.S. report on an almost 400 @-@ percentage increase in the number of children less than twelve years , which swal@@ low weight non @-@ infectious agent such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand san@@ i@@ tizer for children under 12 years , have reported the poison test centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately one percentage of them go in the ER , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants un@@ visi@@ bly drink , while some do it to impress their friends or do because of a mut@@ ase in the social media . &quot;
video videos on YouTube shows how young people inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
juven@@ iles have supposedly mixed a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcohol mouth@@ wash to obtain a tougher beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive types of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ umes .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and oran@@ ges , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in case of small children a few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Kr@@ ft@@ yt@@ eller &apos;s Hospital in the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t have a sip of whis@@ ky , but people let this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come to it then there is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which recently taken four sp@@ lash of straw@@ berry @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was taken into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood pressure was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that applies in adults by law as being drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah spoke their words and was unable to go as they came out in the emergency .
&quot; doctors were monitoring them overnight in a separate children &apos;s home on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had joined the head , &quot; Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah mom , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection agents to store and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol poison@@ ing beyond were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women in Ontario women died after the canyon of hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which dis@@ missed a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product of meth@@ anol has contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol alcohol which has been noted as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state New York put up their &quot; &quot; measured &quot; &quot; teacher , by taking anti @-@ bacterial products all around the classroom , so it announces a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and secur@@ es them out of their room .
the police considered the failed plan as &quot; de@@ ton@@ tz &quot; and the disciplinary action took to the school@@ ing authority .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wenn@@ ingen : damaged three vehicles
at a rear @-@ end on the cross @-@ span@@ ked between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and On Her@@ oes it was easily injured a 33 @-@ year @-@ old passenger .
&quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver went on the cross @-@ turn in the direction of the roundabout industrial area , and realized too late that at the roundabout two over@@ riding vehicles had stopped . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , he pr@@ elo@@ ad with his truck in the rear of an audio test and sh@@ ove this car onto a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the un@@ down vehicles , the police were comprised of approximately 10 000 Euro , divi@@ des the police . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , what was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths , who insisted that he and his Mann@@ ers are not under increased control as they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football stri@@ ker - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald De Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , because there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the R@@ angers .
you are speaking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m @-@ games , and it is not just the people in Scotland who want to see those games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars di@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic needs to fight , but the Norwegian boss oscill@@ or , the things reverse . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malmö and the following res@@ ignation from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now have five points lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had previously been bad times , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel that exactly like this - but we must continue .
&quot; we really need the support provided by Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now together , it is so important . &quot;
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully for January @-@ transfers
&quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago , pointing out that he was a few January @-@ transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful on the signing of new appro@@ vals and ins@@ ists that he does not want to inter@@ rupt the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ ders . &quot;
the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in summer have those pres@@ e@@ ason time to integrate into what you have seen with our own group this season .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there are no team who won everything that played everything in Po@@ kal@@ play or Li@@ gen , the games of this kind also won &apos;t win . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK overall .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period of May to July , while the number of people unemployed per work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period was about 10,000 in 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 per cent as the figures of the offices for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS . ) .
&quot; in the meantime , employment fell in Scotland by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent in the course of the quarter - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has placed the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I become a guard in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope it is not happening , I will sit in a viewer &apos;s gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip caused by the cast sp@@ lashes . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near , I started to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applicants than seats , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lottery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spots from 12 to five .
who is chosen which will be em@@ otive .
I cannot do that .
&quot; in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two @-@ and a half @-@ hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison @-@ authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be permitted to record a notebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will receive access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; they lay hold of it &quot; &quot; It could have been able to form@@ ulate better &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it myself if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
&quot; but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations will help the movement against death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I will not enter any details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ a is inno@@ cent .
&quot; his actions after the assassination of Barry Van F@@ ese would be guilty of him , to be a benefici@@ ary of the act . &quot;
&quot; however , I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of the murder . &quot;
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death judge .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter to whom you can turn to .
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death . &quot;

the p@@ anning V@@ ale poli@@ cem@@ an remained dry when he over@@ speaking the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Perth , the police were un@@ successful , when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few metres from a police officers , who tried to exc@@ el him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed on Tuesday to a domestic break @-@ incident in B@@ low@@ ham .
&quot; discovered the susp@@ ects , it tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming , come and get me , &quot; said Senior S@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Sal@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too impressed to make his Uni@@ form wet , so he turned a reliable tactics - &quot; a good poli@@ cem@@ an act . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to escape to a alcohol control , and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired native to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ ade him and threatens the race for racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy says that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install and dro@@ wn a sp@@ y in his stables last year - to finish the race immediately .
he approached the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and maintained that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment that led to the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ fer@@ rehearsal for Li@@ dar@@ s that he could not explain .
&quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage pro@@ pi@@ onage , and did not want to &quot; see &quot; that it &quot; aus@@ ed as too high @-@ hung grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been to eat , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out of once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
you know that it is far @-@ reaching .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk around you , and I would like my owners , that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I then have to think what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb on an interview with rac@@ ing.com , so that the integrity @-@ division had tried to sp@@ ade his barn . &quot;
&quot; two months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart recently sat in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my stables , to provide information about what I do within my st@@ balls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they clearly believe that I am a sc@@ ammer .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , for they have failed to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy &apos;s President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that time and are still today . &quot;
&quot; should I bring that to the view , that it is personally ? &quot;
does the R@@ V@@ L cra@@ ven itself and perhaps does people outside the trainers responsible for what happens in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and exp@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me very sad .
I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt analysis at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching began to say that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ heard Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race days were &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound was applied to the horse @-@ debate , what was b@@ umped against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees is mistaken to wear mud on the leg .
it could have been that evening so .
it could have been that way yesterday the whole day could have been that way .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy might have faced a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an inquiry into this affair was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far gone , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driving cur@@ ses has been arrested

the cycl@@ ist was supplied with the helicopter into the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on the Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes back at ri@@ vals for allegations of ring @-@ fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ tics of its players as an &quot; Agenda &quot; setting of two Premier League &apos;s favor@@ ites .
Sydney Roo@@ ster coaches Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ers have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring @-@ struggles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett has made a hard envel@@ oping note about the Storm team after his team won the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; example &quot; example of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two out of Queensland were not &quot; good &quot; in R@@ ingen .
&quot; Bell@@ amy , the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; by the Tac@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , added that the criticism of two leading trainers by his team gave him confident as it proved that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that pl@@ unges again and again - I did not listen that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when she has done us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed the whole year at our defensive system or techniques , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ icles a real emphasis and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he probably didn &apos;t get accustomed to losing it , it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny to see how this season starts again and again .
&quot; Bell@@ amy idea has attacked the &quot; &quot; exciting soccer &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett St George Il@@ la@@ eu@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was considered a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a fil@@ th . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we look as exciting , particularly its young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , you want to play if you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so that they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I have stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about having to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game was achieved against ro@@ sters a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are there p@@ auses and do not have any points to span a span ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; when they mention , it means we will meet in a phase still . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has been off this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the Vor@@ finals at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next service tomorrow . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ deposit to drug policies
&quot; a man who could potentially face a lifetime penalty under the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were wi@@ ped to Queensland , was released against a b@@ ail of 200,000 $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the federal poli@@ cem@@ ei 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed when he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the yacht harbour in the course of the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially lifetime penalty for attempts to possess a commercial great deal of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer by Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the coffee could have been from an harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge of the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Ost@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the case of a criminal case he got the police about his place of residence .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vice mother and step@@ father had a security of 200,000 dollars in common , in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ owed statements by the two individuals it is clear that the printing of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ de@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to keep it from it , not to appear , warned him . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail damage , under the conditions that he det@@ ects his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , at the police daily and stick to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ge@@ op@@ hile to send pictures
a ped@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of a 11 year old girl to challenge pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ decent images of children who were sent to it by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hands of the sle@@ ep@@ y H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through she found the confusing message and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five pictures , analyzed the computer , which were found under the address and discovered the &quot; &quot; web research , which I used for the search of in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g said then to officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; ped@@ op@@ hile on the Internet &quot; &quot; and he then announced , to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are them scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the government of E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that he is addic@@ tive to people . &quot;
&quot; he adm@@ its that the seeking on the computer were carried out by him , but said it would happen because he wanted to be a poli@@ cem@@ an , to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ge@@ hi@@ lic . &quot;
he asked for his conversations with the un@@ familiar person who sent him pictures and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head , when he has been drinking , and he said he would see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and crying . &quot;
she then saw the un@@ solic@@ it@@ ous pictures on the telephone and made the accused with it .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said , that the accused would use the accused of computer and Play@@ station , to speak with girls who saw much younger . &quot;

bad user brow@@ ses on small borders on Germany
more and more refugees are picked up in the German @-@ Austrian border in the far @-@ control points .
a lot of locks left out of fear of discovery and fixing the people more involved in smaller cross @-@ borders
&quot; out on the Austrian side , there is a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police . &quot;
&quot; along the grid of the Inn , there have been more than 1,000 refugees along the pass@@ a@@ circles and Rot@@ tal Inn . &quot;
they were walking on the German side by walking via bridges and dust .
they are being collected from federal police and passed on to the registration .
&quot; at Munich &apos;s main train station , more and more refugees arrive at Munich central station to the weekend of the weekend on Wednesday . &quot;

Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner by Tro@@ pen@@ ick &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west .
meteor@@ ologists warn of Stur@@ mo@@ e in the South@@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; because of a deep @-@ pressure area of Western Europe currently warm marine air flows into the country , distributed the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful T@@ ief is the sp@@ urs of the Tro@@ pen@@ ick &quot; Henry , &quot; which was caught over the Atlantic over the past few days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
fierce storms and storm are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday early as early as the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b Al@@ b , and in the Lake Constance region , with bad@@ ges of 60 to 90 hour kilometres . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the sun can be seen again in the sun again . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 above all , movement is noted in the comp@@ acts of comp@@ agen , which is now particularly well sold . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently especially asked : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were reduced to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) only in August this segment .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( publication period 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept autom@@ obil@@ es and new luxury cars and luxury cars will be featured in this year mainly by new compact models .
&quot; the Opel A@@ stra is one of the biggest premi@@ er of the Opel A@@ stra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it is part of the brand .
&quot; thus the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra should not become much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is located directly below the biggest competitor VW Golf in a view , which starts at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euros .
the A@@ stra has a new 1,4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
&quot; furthermore , the H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time three @-@ cylinder petrol engine count . &quot;
&quot; other than the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel A@@ stra first appears as a five @-@ fifth . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant , I will follow in the spring of the comm@@ bi which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will the A@@ stra get to new compact cars next to the A@@ stra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault send the fourth generation of its A@@ stra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is regarded only as five @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atically sporting GT version .
&quot; in trade it comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan &apos;s new model wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti fits in its inu@@ ous lines completely in the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;
the maximum torque is about 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .

&quot; J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell , human @-@ un@@ worthy &quot;
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the U@@ C &apos;s pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was housed in a small cell every month . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have a fundamental right to financial compensation if they are accom@@ o@@ dated in small cells . &quot;
this decision has decided on a decision issued on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope for the judges even if they were imprisoned at only a few days in the too narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; with it was an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe , Germany : he was accommodated in the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell , consisting of approximately five square meters of floor space ; the res@@ tro@@ om was not separate . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who has been moved to his lawyer after data of his lawyer , has now moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his term @-@ duty hing@@ es due to the un@@ worthy prison conditions against the land of Berlin .
&quot; however , the constitutional judge raised the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and rejected the case for the renewed test there . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity injury .
Kammer@@ Court now decide on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of port days for compensation are decisive , whether a statement is given , its name was named . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a tum@@ ult of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clarify the amount of cell damage .
the constitutional mag@@ istr@@ ate have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; so they said only in April a prisoner , to damages , because he was locked in a cell naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy is to make a decision of 2011 , even the multi @-@ allocation of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court , the Berlin Constitutional Court , confirmed an in@@ decent accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the former K@@ lä@@ ger was booked for three months a day from 15 to 21 hours , in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the prisons of Berlin had come to the head@@ lines over the past few weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked into 23 hours , which is aggres@@ si@@ vity , even to stro@@ kes , should it be already for the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial Pres@@ cri@@ es , 21 agencies in Te@@ gel were not occupied because of junior @-@ man@@ ders , 19 should be exp@@ elled from 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seekers came to Germany by proj@@ ections of the Federal Ministry of Commerce this year , to the statement of vice @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated this unusual challenge to resolve : &quot; I am saying again and again : we can do this and we create that . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , the following overview is given . &quot;
&quot; according to various forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Labour ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and the next five years . &quot;
it &apos;s almost twice as much as has been built up to now ( 250@@ 000 dwellings ) .
&quot; the lack of housing , but especially in affordable housing objects : a year , 60@@ ,000 up to 80@@ ,000 social housing from hiring households , and around these especially low @-@ priced apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore wants to double the promotion , of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to arise annually , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in agreement , scientists and Federal Minister agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research and Department Research , 55 per cent of the refugees fle@@ es in Germany can be assessed for the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , in Germany the refugees were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them start , with critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is crucial whether they will find jobs in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self esteem of the immig@@ rant , &quot; says Migr@@ ations researcher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ el@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there has been a political transition according to Arch@@ ur@@ hardt : from the work of refugees to recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while it was a job of employment for asylum seekers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residences that asylum seekers has limited to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , however , because of the shortage of skilled workers , the view took a majority of view that refugees should be able to get access to the labour market faster . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for entry to the labour market are of a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is no such offer for general and occupational @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies show that jobs most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the creation of networks is therefore according to Thr@@ el@@ hardt on the road integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration recognized that only a few refugees fle@@ es their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated at ten to 15 per cent : &quot; &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents , it is only quite important to keep the family together , &quot; said Il@@ ja co@@ ar@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family members in Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , distribute the manuals in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators rise strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about by increasing more medical schools . &quot;
in the countries students without German knowledge are prepared for classes in competition classes .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , like in Berlin , also of teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no defect on them , says Be@@ ate St@@ em is the Berlin school administration . &quot;
German Studenten@@ werk is estimated that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal land asylum seekers or don@@ ate the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior , Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) , however , gave up his attitude now . &quot;
academic refugees could be facilitated by the university &apos;s access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a residence permit or debt receive no achievements after asylum seekers or more if they begin to study . &quot;
the latter is not going to get a BA@@ Fö@@ G because they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ ated persons .
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G &apos;s license , from 1 January 2016 to shortened this Spanish @-@ span for 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this funding gap must also be closed but call Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Under@@ secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; but Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should ob@@ lige the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches to develop a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important as the foundation of a Islamic charity , which cares for new arrivals . &quot;
the Rights also include obligations .
&quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and be willing to work together with the state in many areas , giving it some control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes readiness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be transferred to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to pun@@ ish such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more today than today an issue of society .
&quot; with this will also have to change the majority society , the exploitation of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany indeed - as a result of European decisions - has been a anti @-@ discrimination directives and a General Equality Act for a short decade .
&quot; but it very slowly learns how the NS@@ U series was presented , in which police and authorities have systematically ignored the racial motive . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders are not demanding for a long time , and what international agreements like anti @-@ rac@@ ist terrorism will have to become reality in the coming years if the country will be peaceful , and its new citizens should use its possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , Germany is capable of providing medi@@ cally anticipated refugees , Doc@@ tor &apos;s president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , this means extra money to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , invites all com@@ ers immediately to the registration of health @-@ types . &quot;
these services could later be reck@@ oned with the Bundes@@ länder later .
&quot; and in the long term it is highly questionable , so many people are un@@ question@@ ing with the limited power catalogue , which fores@@ ees the asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are mainly making language barrier . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin Health Sciences The@@ a Bor@@ de have proven that migrants are worse off their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical offices , would need to be taken over by translator . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many refugees would also be assisted with more general medical stations in emergency out@@ performed . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; under refugee @-@ up , there are some distinc@@ tly more un@@ obstruc@@ tive disabilities ; and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
with the partial other disease models German doctors came from their training but clearly writes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation , or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; and as for the therap@@ ists , it is possible to take even relie@@ ving in sight by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians have developed a sophisticated educational system , several refugees and even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take off tests . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees coming to Germany is , according to the estimates of the Bund@@ aber@@ ration ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically sick : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorders or under depression . &quot;
&quot; in particular , be refugee camp , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study conducted by the TU München shows that each fifth of Syrian refugees traumati@@ sed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , suffers from other things to so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs , with respiratory for , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and de@@ ath@@ ir@@ th . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include difficulty and concentration , strong terr@@ ors and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , declared Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; though , psych@@ ologically sick @-@ seekers can face an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the social offices , most of the cases of non @-@ lab@@ our@@ ers or doctors , who are not trained for the mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this frequently perform to mal@@ ign@@ ments , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new production &quot; passion &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
&quot; the goal is to pull each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;

&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current management stage staging .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family . &quot;
the offering to fascin@@ ate the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to take away the people away from their everyday life and to take them for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior athletes . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
&quot; indeed , 50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;

Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics such as little other and fascinated with its flexibility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every sense .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Stephan@@ ies mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
abnorm@@ alities of the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a subject in various animal rescue organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also assumes that position : &quot; &quot; if it does not happen on our animals , it does not happen well . &quot;
each car@@ esses can enjoy about 80 animals from five different continents into each unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged arti@@ sts &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal does not feel at ease and does not want it into the ring .
&quot; thus , the most important commandment : good for the animals . &quot;
&quot; especially on its zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is prohi@@ bit proud . &quot;
the two animals spent eight years in a en@@ closure and nothing is happening .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little jum@@ bo &quot; , &quot; told Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so for every visitor something might be part of it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or more 200 participants , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ y@@ man Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped out of a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; last he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by allegations of members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and had warned them to accompany the pronoun@@ cement of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ ggy . &quot;
&quot; last month , they took him off and interrupted for him during his speech on the State of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ tics politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones which they were waiting to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; they warned the affected Parliament members that the immunity in parliament will end , and once they leave the parliament , parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the chief speaker said , that the &quot; &quot; Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &quot; &quot; party is &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; about the danger for the politicians . &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to rebuild from 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and reduction efforts at the company &apos;s services .
&quot; HP is going to divide into two listed companies later this year , and separate the computer and press business from its fast growing company @-@ hardware and service operations . &quot;
&quot; the expected job building leads to a load of more than $ 2,@@ 7 billion in the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable economy structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ president and Chief Executive , which is supposed to lead the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and diversified portfolio of shops to help companies with the transition to a new style of business &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has launched more than 50 billion $ 2012 and will be focused on providing unlimited technology solutions to companies , &quot; &quot; says an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it shares a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electr@@ o @-@ installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called the birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to cope with the coming from traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest U.S. high @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on belief that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal &apos;s captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mate will have to stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it &apos;s only September and where his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play Christmas before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and , in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly attend the European Championship . &quot;
&quot; the great shame at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate papules removal , and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , that is not well healed . &quot;
it is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
&quot; he was not in contact with his an@@ kles , or with the injury they had previously had . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from pure medical point of view but as little ones well recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injury , always if a player is trying to get back in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
&quot; the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere , since his debut in six years ago . &quot;
he also played in just 65 out of arsen@@ al as 15@@ 7 lig@@ asp@@ ed in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader image for Arsenal is that in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs , most of the vulner@@ age have been reported . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a tense period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain strength &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ gauge in the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team . &quot;
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia that means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and to give players who need it to give a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is among the play@@ grounds with the biggest intimid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 years after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken on the Tuesday evening by a earthquake , which were measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
&quot; this is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lessons of the past season with the champi@@ ons of the Champions League , and remains far @-@ away with his management to lead the association with his first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this impulse is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never been folded in arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough at the shop to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendly Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s family
&quot; lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for males to open up now even more doub@@ ters than ever , such as self @-@ murder among young males on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high proof . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the issue , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ faces ( CA@@ LM sets campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the goal to ask the culture to seek help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ rep@@ ie@@ ce of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms proved that when the suff@@ erer received a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere &quot; , &quot; his chances of recovery has doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship may function . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication , communication with its focus on the substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , viable and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists are ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the cost of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much more deep . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money cannot really buy . &quot;
the beautiful thing for friends was that this focuss@@ ing on the head was put on .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler have frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ros@@ s to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men can definitely return , even though they often go back , completely explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the phone care , I explained : ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and confident , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest inter@@ play of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; I com@@ et the old phrase &quot; I com@@ m with this &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how it feels that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term procurement mechanisms . &quot;
it clearly shows clearly the small moments of men of men .
so much my object &apos;s out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone to help people in moments of sight may also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely new designed setting , why do not take your friends with a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you &apos;re in Star@@ bucks you see alone , give him a smile and tell me Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; di Maria meets to help P@@ SG , Malmö to rent &quot;
Angel Di Maria continues with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Sam@@ son Cav@@ ani according to his follow @-@ up on Malmö .
&quot; di Maria is in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps P@@ SG to pass by Malmö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Sam@@ son Cav@@ ani held each course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain won his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 battle against Malmö in the Prin@@ t@@ park@@ gar@@ on on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League &apos;s debut as P@@ SG player who brought the French masters on the way , but after that they finally passed a series of opportunities before they finally lifted up their lead , when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ room in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only striving for the qualification rounds , but an improvement on the way to the fourth quarter in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no Kl@@ ass@@ esp@@ iel of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an ap@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s negoti@@ able before the gate . he was later started in the game against his home town and against the association with which he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; says Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; b@@ ap@@ him@@ ovic returned to Paris in one of three changes in the Paris team , which on the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League . but he was driven by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian side @-@ stor@@ mer was called the man to take the P@@ SG to the next stage in Europe , when he ran at Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö defense , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and finished nicely in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if anyone believed that P@@ SG would achieve a great victory , which was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , Celtic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , joined in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep within the middle @-@ field mat@@ ured to heavy opponents . &quot;
&quot; but besides a kiss from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , P@@ SG itself sometimes gave up , with some undes@@ cri@@ mp and bad connections , not least by Po@@ him@@ ovic , who was then abandoned at no less than five attempts in the first half of the party and then abandoned after the restart . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed much more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game , and it was a pass of Po@@ him@@ ovic , turned into a shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole . &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus scored his sixth Se@@ ason , after the him@@ ovic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malmö can return to the game , and only an excellent entry of Wil@@ ders from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before sub@@ player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognize a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that P@@ SG has played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; our last champi@@ ons league game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi played for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; FC Bayern was obviously just before a few years before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish master , three times Po@@ kal@@ sie@@ ger , three times champion League winner , two times champion world champion , two times champion masters , a time champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and went to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi do now that he was already standing in front of the EM in 2008 in front of the departure of Barcelona . &quot;
she told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we say nothing , &quot; he tells . &quot;
and the registered member of the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
reminder : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ visor took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man therefore works for the German record master : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM .
&quot; PE@@ P has told me that I would not change , that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; with this , he has been spot@@ ted . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film coverage
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on proposed the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said , she does not need behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a succession of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actors Brown retired as this the need for alternative perspectives indicated , and in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it during the filling of the film and not during the occupation of the show &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown reacted shocking , with ins@@ ul@@ ted Un@@ believe and called &quot; ho@@ o ! wow . &quot; okay , &quot; when the comments made by the actor of The Mar@@ tian turned . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the product , Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly @-@ brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - who also will be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a nut@@ shell , which is defeated by her white Zu@@ h@@ em . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People aimed at the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the director &apos;s rights at the film ; Dam@@ on ref@@ utes that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion is aired , the social media explo@@ ded before the endor@@ sement of the Dam@@ ons comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni crossed his anger through the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can tell her diversity - that &apos;s SO W@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ et , and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ ons comments arrive at a time when the exact race representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement of Black lives were nationally and urged regul@@ ators and authorities to discrimin@@ ate against discrimin@@ atory practices . &quot;
in February the voc@@ alist Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inees of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet weaker , ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums were still their significance . &quot;
more recently the leaders of the Black lives Mat@@ ter have published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ President Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be considered as a hatred group .
&quot; the network of Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the guides . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ees , producers and media outlets that will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .

&quot; professional clim@@ bers and 0@@ 7@@ Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athle@@ te , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the contest , which just finished her 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant , who won all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season of the season there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final . &quot;
the rock @-@ climbing was also one 75 feet long climbing @-@ rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time , which was the first athle@@ te to finish the first Ath@@ let , who ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . nevertheless , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge total three seconds faster , which made him winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero talked with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock on winning the Great Prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or go to life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot;
as suddenly as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the Chief producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood repor@@ ters to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he was first at all the course , not receiving any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much the money is a wonderful price and changed life , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t believe it would have such a res@@ entment in it .
he has just been happy to have done what he did .
massive decisions received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by somebody , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac had just as felt , if they had exchanged the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for a second season , filming will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers is passing by Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NO AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers standing on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to her role as Spo@@ iler , but played this part in perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins has a chance to rise up within a half of the Houston branch of Ast@@ ros for the second American League game card .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was difficult to grasp more than a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad extracts . &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support erect as Detroit three times in the first two gro@@ ings then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ings and made three rings .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year greatly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ seye each game , and that &apos;s why I really want to go into the game . &quot;
the nomin@@ ee tiger @-@ Hitler &apos;s Victor Martin@@ ez had three hit and was in two ranks ; his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against the Seattle naval headquarters on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has done the drums good &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( drums training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ seye , and he brought it directly to the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the backyard @-@ meeting at the end of the seventh session the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks achieved a bun@@ ny , and Simon gave his second Bas@@ ner Brian Do@@ c to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed wall , the only man with which he was faced , before the nomin@@ ee R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who made the right guy Dre@@ w Ver@@ ges a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; through a pair of runners , and the close @-@ run of the second brought Ver@@ ges the third Bas@@ ner Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play . &quot;
this was the Major League leading 27 times this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a Double Play .
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inside , the wall made an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
however the right @-@ handed plate however S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save is out .
Detroit benefited the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from an unprecedented Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three runs in the first two inner ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game by the injury @-@ list , after having been spot@@ ted more than a month for a back @-@ suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt like I started off and felt that I would do some pretty good Pit@@ ches as we did in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after she received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , she gave me a single song at second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez to won a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez made his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos ended with a single on the right hand , made another run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third , which was the threat . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers laid in the second place achieved a one @-@ out double from Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not been kno@@ cked out very well , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , generated no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the reloc@@ ated right handed . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there came to three R@@ us at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ps . &quot;
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal S@@ án@@ chez divided because of an injury to the worm school .
&quot; he is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the S@@ án@@ chez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ chez , who has been on the risk of injuries since mid @-@ August , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the risk of injuries was painted , in order to start against the tw@@ ins . &quot;

Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers will want to take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special course for a binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee research in Germany , the federal government plans to support the countries in the first @-@ up and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced the late afternoon after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the chan@@ cell@@ or in Berlin . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther Platz .
&quot; in the presence of the town of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previously un@@ inhabited site in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill , was bapti@@ sed in the name of the German Reform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now acknowledged as a &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome in addition to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live over centuries as a minority often only in secret by their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the square I become visible in a symbolic way , that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome was welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 some months in Rome .
he found the town back then as a for@@ get@@ ful sc@@ ap@@ y ba@@ bel .

hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( Con@@ gol@@ ese ) Dor@@ nen@@ cr@@ one is one of the main buildings , that is painted in Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and scriptures .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible , which is now appearing with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture of Ot@@ mar Old , who has formulated his own personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for three years , for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of &quot; books of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; arise of cycles that are dedicated to topics such as cross @-@ pl@@ ings , pl@@ agues , commandments , or father@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; with this he spontaneously fascinated several partners : that is true for the Luther &apos;s publishing company with his the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag , focusing on art books . &quot;
and that is above all the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post who dealt himself up on the basis of painting with the respective scriptures .
&quot; he has interpreted the scriptures from Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ selected Bible and thus , in the present , into current relations . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ally of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; it &apos;s embedded between the original Bible verses of Martin Luther and each and a set of the artist , who is here his own personal thoughts for the respective situation . &quot;
the gem @-@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a profound insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately not a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant missionary medal . &quot;
&quot; since the education came with the ship stock , &quot; says Ot@@ mar &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to do that , maybe to keep me with the Lord Father too . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to increase the significance of art in the quick@@ est time again : &quot; &quot; the perception of picture worlds is today c@@ im@@ min@@ ted today , and which is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out .
artists have a different desire and desire to show things .
images always have a kind of secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to get the viewer out into the pictures , &quot; &quot; take them down , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture seeks his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post stri@@ an on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar &apos;@@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art , &quot; &quot; seems to have been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Arts &quot; &quot; : &quot; I like , how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; do not take care to capture the Bible completely , but selected the essenti@@ als for him , as well as mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; it is about the pictures , the lyrics just described . &quot; created be a picture @-@ Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the original - paper and wall @-@ wall pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned to model Earth @-@ guard for a circuit . one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration provided for rent , especially with the residents who did not tolerate the train . &quot;
&quot; thus hills de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permits . &quot;
&quot; the approval will go in October , was the first municipal council of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the children &apos;s and Youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should be started without any &quot; &quot; commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
football respon@@ ds to the mounting situation in Germany and secur@@ es the policy its help in coping with the previous problems .
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since the reunion . &quot;
&quot; there no one can say in the principle that nothing is about , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; that must be interested in each individual to get this subject in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B &apos;s chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and enter the Minister of Minister E@@ o@@ ğ@@ u@@ z , and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; then the topic will certainly play a key role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football would be able to help and want to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must be the policy .
the German football federal government has therefore extend its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program runs through 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEF@@ A Conference in St. Juli@@ an@@ us / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ lig@@ tics support this program .
already this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ mel set out a clear sign when it takes place on the left tri@@ cot @-@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # fe@@ es@@ welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that all should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sports chief of Ru@@ di Völ@@ ders of the &quot; &quot; Pain@@ ter &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; granted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the acquiring drama goes every one , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we are able to hire football team , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Peter Ret@@ tig talked about a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees to a large common plant in German football .
&quot; that all 36 roy@@ alties in their places have started their own projects , be great . &quot;
&quot; just as great is , that small and smallest associations are there . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we have spent , will be living in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association is providing 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole amount for 2015 as well , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ De@@ dic@@ s loses an eye in the accident
&quot; the head of the European Union &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has repor@@ tedly lost the left eye for several reports by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; when he had an accident on the stairs leading to his brother in the USA , he looked after midnight on a water @-@ glass which he had carried in the left hand , &quot; &quot; Economic Week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ha@@ sty , was power@@ less , and then dropped out on the road - that he told us this last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; and founder of the turn@@ around is quoted . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet ahead of the meeting meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Plat@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 year old manager was with the meeting and &quot; fully functioning . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( on Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software group . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its president H@@ asso &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; anyone can happen such a thing . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stay up again , if you really liked it . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ted a similar photo , saying , he suffered the injury , when he cras@@ hed out of the wheel . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he comes to the offspring in Singapore last weekend as little as a reserve for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button in@@ ask , like a week later at the Great Prize of Japan . &quot;
soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ feller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes of winning a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa league .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundesliga as well as in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we can not rely on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga team against Le@@ verk@@ usen , let the BV@@ B coach open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the high stress of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its regular eleven on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the door@@ step position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ feller assumes the place from Chief Con@@ man Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained on a absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the Football Teacher to the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; if Wei@@ den@@ feller in future come to use in all of the European league games , however , the tu@@ ck@@ les were open . &quot;
with high probability he will argue the second game .
&quot; the formal statement of fellow players Re@@ us that the final statement for the B@@ B in the Europe League has to be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l is for veri@@ fying : &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot;
Rob@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the pioneering role for Germany
Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner after the government &apos;s will at the transformation of the car technology .
&quot; the federal cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Verkehrs@@ betriebe Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees an investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse IA@@ A of a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
automated driving and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and provide for less steel . Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries which meet with the representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
the strategy paper of the Department of Commerce emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band deplo@@ y@@ ons and a generous turn@@ around to digital audio .
&quot; currently , for testing the new technique there is currently a test track on the 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order to give the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the German government wants to examine the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany wants to employ around internationally for this , that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars is up@@ lifted from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will also want to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only provided people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes over the car the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Commerce , a highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 is technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they are expected to expect huge vehicles on public roads to be expected later by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ governmental stig@@ ator S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in dis@@ closures and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clear . &quot;
even the Germans are still skep@@ tical about the Germans - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA dis@@ proposed survey of the For@@ sa institute in order of the testing re@@ organization DE@@ K@@ RA will believe that only eight percent of Germans believe that self @-@ reli@@ ant cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent not believe in 20 years , but 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; 21 percent of respondents count up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent agree to give control during the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , that in flowing traffic could nevertheless imagine 15 per cent , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would be left to the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team - and double start with ping @-@ p@@ ong EM @-@ EM
Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to stand up to the title fight from 25 September to 4 October only in the individual .
the final decision is scheduled to be handed down at the latest on September 22nd .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; said Par@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ Guide in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this point , B@@ oll was on the flight at a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer so clear favour@@ it &quot; , &quot; said @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ mond , who later results the S@@ etz@@ als in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also rec@@ alled to the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; then , Timo also was spot@@ ted , and we are European masters . &quot;
&quot; this is how we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ story @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has drawn a heavy injury to the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven was taken by the def@@ ender of a Tac@@ tics of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno , after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an end
&quot; the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier , the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) was presented at the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) on Wednesday in Munich . &quot;
&quot; the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , which may look scary thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits , became the big star of the scene , and thus that he put men into the skirts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the end of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was very light , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The S@@ ide@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Ci@@ ph@@ g on the cat@@ walk ) , that is to be seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ pot@@ ters has changed his bud@@ ding stance on a picture above his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; For me , an exhibition sounded a little bit &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said . &quot;
when one dies down one comes to the museum .
&quot; the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal , Montreal and in Paris station . &quot;
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it comes to tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into this man &apos;s hard work , the fashion history has ever written , without ever having completed a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an outstanding chore@@ o@@ grap@@ hing total , for which much effort was done : to rec@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have f@@ aded the makers according to specifications of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot after Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Revolution there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen match with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested himself for strong women ( &quot; &quot; Women are s@@ lau@@ er than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier old Te@@ ddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ em@@ bodi@@ ment of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in soccer ) he had attracted his te@@ ddy B@@ HS and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him to play . &quot;
he brought into fashion and later he brought himself to himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion journals and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought it and off course of course .
for his first own fashion show it did not have to pay the mod@@ els .
&quot; they got nothing , they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener top as a fashion @-@ niche
&quot; earlier , we went to the long nit@@ rogen machines in and around pl@@ ings to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and tips created in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example on blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ ra@@ vines . &quot;
instead the fashion is again important .
&quot; during the early periods of the Pl@@ au@@ ener top , fashion played a major role , was then sup@@ pressed by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage mode which re@@ jects itself in past sticks , an increasing contractor . &quot;
&quot; who does not use any niche markets in the textile branch in Germany is no longer available on the market . &quot;
in our company they already make half of all the orders .
Mo@@ vie@@ won Pl@@ ust is a member of the ranks of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they must bear the protected label .
about 80 percent of its sales were cut away in the last 15 years .
private stores and also wholesale trade there are almost no more .
we hardly reach our products in this way .
&quot; however , the mass product in the Asian region is much cheaper and almost is distributed almost from chains . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the export of export , to Russia and the USA is also weaker . &quot;
enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer von der nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; this year we are leading a seal of quality that we produce environmentally and socially toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the used materials .
Diplom@@ acy U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger Out@@ side of the West @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for applied arts - and is specialised in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tops .
&quot; in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies which must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design may only be slightly modified to hold a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago the specially animated textile firm Kat@@ i Re@@ uter has re@@ discovered the historical sn@@ ail tip .
the machine sticks to some places small cows .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ auss has inspired himself , &quot; &quot; formerly I could not do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she is using the snow@@ ball top for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies them to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ ings and surroundings and want to mem@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze the memory . &quot;
&quot; with this , I view my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to stir but Disney still faces a new movie by his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; according to Entertainment Weekly , it is not about a re @-@ cinem@@ atic , but a sort of continuation , which is 20 years after the first film plays with the magical children &apos;s n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in the times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins in more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already stuck : ro@@ b Marshall , finally with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy broader for the world
&quot; the economy must open itself wide to the outside to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping to the Tuesday of a group that was asked to reform the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should devote himself to increasing foreign investment and expertise and to improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in an address in the 16th meeting of the central executive group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promote innovation and reform will boost new impetus and vitality , and bring new space for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the man@@ ag@@ erial group has adopted a series of policies including a negative list of regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the citizen @-@ system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not in question for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ points to the market a major role in access of resources , a legally state business environment and has an open market , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government is also attracting over the powers transferred to the enterprises and make sure companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow China border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; in the context of an offer , controlled by sectors , other areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will furnis@@ h the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it will be easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by making the requirements optimised and the application process will be facilitated . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
at the meeting the Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as was reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants mer@@ cury edge @-@ value in predat@@ or@@ fish .
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large predat@@ ory fishing and makes the consumers a much higher dose of nerve fibres .
&quot; the Verbraucher@@ zentrale F@@ ood@@ watch , which is right in the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharply : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects empi@@ ri@@ fied industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full weight to pregnant and infants , &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt von F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the threshold values of the neur@@ ons are to be raised at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury each kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; big predat@@ ory Fish , however , are so heavily poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury that can not be sold on the basis of even current limits about 50 percent of the length . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ ven@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; ood@@ watch recorded this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ eter@@ ies , as approximately car@@ p are usually so low stressed that they are already keeping the planned high@@ s already today . &quot;
&quot; the distr@@ action in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; an per@@ fi@@ de Ab@@ len@@ eck &quot; , &quot; which alone helps the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
Mercury is a man of highly toxic heavy metals that prevailed over the food chain in particular in predat@@ ors .
the German government therefore warns that &quot; even small amounts can cause particularly severe damage of the nervous system .
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment explains on its homepage with regard to the current expectations , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
Mercury is achieved primarily through the carbon burning to the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of German power , the German coal mining employers met more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany em@@ itted total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted in March of the paper . &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings on mer@@ cury in fish were already considered the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
