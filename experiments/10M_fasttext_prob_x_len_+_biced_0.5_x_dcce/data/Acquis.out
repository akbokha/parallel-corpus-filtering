&quot; should the core material , the backup measures on this Convention is subject to non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agreed the fel@@ lowship with the organization of such use of material , under which circumstances the backup measures on this material can be completed in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the not@@ ches used during the duration of non @-@ application of security measures after this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ ers .
B ) The organization and the community meet a regulation that intended in this agreement will not be applied only as long as the core material used in such activity .
&quot; in control as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will be used again in this Convention as soon as the core material will resume a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is kept on the total quantity and composition of this material in the country or in the relevant states , and on any distribution of such material from this state or of these states out of the current state . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent to as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as in other time @-@ time and practic@@ able provisions for the reporting , but does not include a accounting or a secret protection of military activity , and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;

purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify how to implement the provisions of the part I on backup measures as required .
&quot; the goal of the backup measures established in this Convention is the timely detection of a significant quantities of peaceful nuclear material for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ ers for un@@ known purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such a branch by the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; for the enrich@@ ment of the in Article 28 defined goal , the material case will be used as a backup measure of fundamental importance , inter@@ ruption with the spatial intervention and observation as an important suppl@@ em@@ ental measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of veri@@ fications by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for any material balance zone which is not listed for a certain period of time , under specification of the most accurate limits of the specified Me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; when carrying out their post@@ insp@@ ections , the organisation for article 3 full use of the hed@@ ging system of the community . &quot;
the account@@ ancy and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
&quot; when applying its backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make the following kind of use and they , as far as required , see how they are in suppl@@ em@@ ental changes , and purpose are : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preser@@ v@@ em , her@@ al@@ ted , lost , abandoned , deser@@ ted or other way out of the stocks distant core and the component . &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and estim@@ ation of measurement in@@ security ;

&quot; between the European nuclear community and the Swiss E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft Mineral@@ wolle e.V. , in the area of the controlled nuclear fusion and the Plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k &quot;
&quot; the European nuclear community , &quot; &quot; Euratom &quot; &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , below , &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot;
&quot; and THE Swiss E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft , named &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , listed below &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; , &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental system , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company according to Chapter V of Euratom Treaty - is listed below &quot; &quot; Joint Company JET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been working with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plas@@ ma hy@@ si@@ k and is well acquainted with the particular area . &quot;
&quot; as far as to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contract parties to avoid un@@ necessary efforts and have gained their respective research , which due to the energy crisis resulted in higher education . &quot;
&quot; this agreement shall enable every contractual party to be able to avoid use of their research efforts in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and the plas@@ ma @-@ si@@ cs for the mutually beneficial benefits , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear mer@@ ging reaction to achieve faster . &quot;

&quot; within this agreement , the export possibilities for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat from Argentina after the Community are determined on the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure a proper procedure that the actual set out of the agreed amount did not exce@@ eds the agreed amount and executed in accordance with the traditional Offer ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change in the Offer is possible , as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult with each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the number 10 indicated committees to find an appropriate solution . &quot;

&quot; the community takes everything to avoid a market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ in@@ ean Ham@@ mel and L@@ amm@@ atic on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community arrives , so that the paragraph of interven@@ tion@@ ists in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of Argent@@ ine ham@@ mel - and lam@@ bs does not under@@ mines . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the goals and regulations of this agreement , the community declares that any actual use of elements or other funding measures for the export of Ham@@ mel and lam@@ bs , as well as for s@@ laughter certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international commitments and take into account the traditional share of community trade with these products . &quot;

the committee discussed all relevant questions during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the appropriate regulatory authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall be governed by the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; the agreement is valid for : - fresh or cool@@ ed ham@@ mel , lam@@ b and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; following this agreement , New Zealand is established for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat , access to the market of the community in the agreement established in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives assur@@ ances that the normal he@@ el of his ham@@ mel - and lam@@ b@@ alists is not drawn through the application of the regulation in co @-@ passion .
&quot; to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , committed to the New Zealand , by ensuring suitable procedures that the actual amount did not exce@@ eds the set amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ standing quantities are executed in conventional supply ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand with this agreement should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
&quot; if a change in the Offer is possible , as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the cl@@ ause 10 stated committees to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
