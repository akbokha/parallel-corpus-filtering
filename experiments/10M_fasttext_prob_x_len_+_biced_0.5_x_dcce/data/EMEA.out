&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ges report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the committee has been evaluated , in order to reach recommendations on the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the pack@@ et device ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or chem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the based recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that appear in the mouth ) as solution to entry ( 7.5 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
B. wir@@ res mind and Spe@@ ech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a psychological disorder , in which the patients have several episodes ( periods of ab@@ normal high @-@ tuning ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
bili@@ fy is applied to the treatment of moderate to severe lack of episodes and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the inj@@ ecting solution is applied to rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders when the oral in@@ ges@@ tion of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to one or the mel@@ ting tablets in patients where the slots of tablets are being prepared . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably acts mainly as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ d zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in slightly lower dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine can play a role in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , contributing to norm@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and may be prevented re @-@ occurring . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of furniture , the re @-@ emergence of the symptoms , has been studied in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , or similar diseases resulting in increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been stabili@@ zed over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in a different study the effectiveness of bili@@ cal and plac@@ ebo that have been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with furniture . &quot;
the efficacy of a bili@@ cal inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which rose to increased un@@ rest , compared with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies the variation of patients with a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients said , were examined to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also conducted studies in order to examine the body the mel@@ ting storage and the solution for entry is res@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting solution showed patients who received r@@ bili@@ fy in doses from 13,@@ mg , 9.@@ mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased un@@ rest than patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased veins , in four of the five short @-@ term studies lack more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re @-@ performing man@@ ic episodes with previously treated patients and if it was administ@@ ered in addition to an existing treatment .
furniture inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects from A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extrac@@ ted ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( in@@ con@@ sol@@ ation ) , prot@@ ru@@ ary secre@@ tion ( increased sali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ essness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and from intermediate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes have out@@ weigh the risks with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ections in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission shared the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. permit a permit for the trading of furniture in the entire European Union . &quot;
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients shown mainly man@@ ic episodes and their lack of episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a reduction of 15 mg / day daily independent of meals .
&quot; increased efficiency in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or com@@ bin@@ ational therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ als should be considered as clinical factors that justify ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ elec@@ tor is set off from the com@@ bin@@ ational therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ d zo@@ l @-@ dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the appearance of su@@ izi@@ a behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after starting or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy even in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder is not an increased suff@@ iciency risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ otic disorder .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ th@@ ic or sham@@ eful disease , conditions , which are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ ony co@@ de@@ duc@@ tive diseases ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ous and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which was a year or less dau@@ g@@ ated , there were occasional reports of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ris@@ er Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if in one with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ es@@ th@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , are cancelled . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ ants in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at the states that are applied with c@@ amp@@ fan@@ ages , with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis that were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a raised mortality rate compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was one study in one of these studies , a study with fixed doses , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
hyper@@ gl@@ yk@@ emia in some cases extremely and associated with c@@ eto@@ es or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gl@@ yk@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents of patients to allow the direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of the gl@@ uc@@ ose values . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed by schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to composite bi@@ ologically , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ otic substances , in which weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable if Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central drugs with themselves over@@ tax@@ ed side effects such as Se@@ en@@ coding ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a stomach acid @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the remains of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not relevant to clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers increased a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inc@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as fluid @-@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosage . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans , the common application with highly effective inser@@ tions of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is a result of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 results resulting in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible met@@ abolic disease . &quot;
&quot; if one draws the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks to patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inc@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ef@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage . &quot;
&quot; after placing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dosage height before the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 common with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y can be administ@@ ered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials doses showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l per day no significant effect on the met@@ abolic disorders of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of the people and due to the burden on animal studies , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential health benefits justify the potential risk to fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic patients the patients should be warned of hazardous machines , including power vehicles , to operate until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side @-@ effects appeared more common ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) than on plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the down side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks joined in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ zo@@ l ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ic , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ soprano ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.5 % in patients suffer from plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;

&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term planning phase over 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.0 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; comparison between patients and groups of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; Enh@@ ancements of the CP@@ K ( credit @-@ phosph@@ ate @-@ gases ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2.9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neur@@ l@@ ep@@ tic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and c@@ amp@@ fan@@ es , undes@@ irable developments and increased mortality in elderly patients , hyper@@ gl@@ it@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the launch of the market , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional tension with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death succession . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a modi@@ tization with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l before ; it is unlikely however , that hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis has been beneficial in the treatment of a surplus value , since Ari@@ pi@@ d zo@@ l has a high degree of plastics . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption about the combination of a particip@@ ag@@ onal effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will be convey@@ ed .

in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psychological symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was 52 the share of the Res@@ p@@ onder patients , which in both groups are similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values made from Mess@@ ales , which were defined as secondary study , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ant scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo controlled study on 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia showed himself a significantly higher reduction of the back rate that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % among plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in an o@@ pe@@ er in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study involving schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients encomp@@ ass@@ ed a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the output level ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.7 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l towards plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ ats and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a compared to plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and an un@@ sustainable effect , which was comparable to that of li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l also pointed out a compar@@ ative share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as li@@ thium or Semi@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;

a non @-@ specific evaluation of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics yiel@@ ded no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency in comparison to young healthy volunteers .

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study , on the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously received a anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ a gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in combination ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between medicines such as time to deterioration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , at patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
it must also be applied to patients who are breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils in the blood .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ ic drugs ( CH@@ MP ) exhibited that Abra@@ x@@ ane was no longer contradic@@ tory , in which the first treatment was no longer reflected , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , medicines that it has to be given in opposition to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el to decrease side effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission shared the firm xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited was a permit for the in@@ stig@@ ation of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment is missing for metastatic disease and not shown for a standard anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine Peri@@ odi@@ c therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ y number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe Sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; in sensory N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 is the treatment to break down , until a improvement is reached on degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose has to be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; there were no studies conducted with patients with han@@ dic@@ apped kidney function , and there are currently no sufficient data for dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bent nan@@ op@@ ul@@ li@@ form@@ ulating of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could be essentially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be immediately introduced and the patient should not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again . &quot;
&quot; in the patients no renewed mol@@ ane treatment cycles should be introduced , until the ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils are increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ sis over 100 x 109 / l has increased . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while an un@@ ambig@@ uous den@@ ig@@ nition has not been proven in connection of the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardi@@ ogenic inci@@ dents in the inde@@ xed patient treatment are not uncommon , especially in patients with former anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be dealt with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ tial means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , which are not used effective recei@@ vable , except for the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoidable . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should be applied during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , is advised , while and up to six months after the treatment no child has to witness . &quot;
male patients should be advised to advise before treating a sperm archiving , since therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irrever@@ sible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause any side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and ver@@ win@@ dle ( frequent ) that can affect the transport and ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma that were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules ingredient which promotes the co@@ sting of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ lets and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing its Dep@@ ending .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhi@@ bit of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ape network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the exotic cell@@ functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in Trans@@ zy@@ t@@ ose of Plas@@ mak@@ om@@ pon@@ ers has been introduced into the End@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells and as part of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes by the End@@ ot@@ hel@@ ical cells .

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma is treated by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ formed studies and 4@@ 54 patients which were treated in random@@ ized Phase III studies .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma were treated with pe@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; this multi @-@ centr@@ alised study was conducted in patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ based P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with em@@ medi@@ al reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without com@@ medication ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the recording in the study , 64 % of patients had a general public state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ as@@ serts . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had never received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % for Met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to Met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and for the adjuv@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients , which received &gt; First @-@ line therapy are below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patient which at a time during therapy a periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 survived .
the natural course of periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of pe@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .

the average volume of distribution amo@@ unted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high volume volume has a long @-@ ranging ex@@ trav@@ al distribution and / or m@@ oll@@ ection of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic qualities of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ hour inj@@ ections of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ vent @-@ based P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
the clearance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher than x@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ based P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and also the distribution volume was even higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human living micro@@ some and certain@@ ties will report that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .

&quot; in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency or patients who receive chemotherapy , hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ om@@ inations always should be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults respectively between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be used prior to treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency is , and iron compl@@ ementary should be administ@@ ered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or by that the body is not sufficient to the body &apos;s body @-@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied in operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it is capable of formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as inj@@ ecting in a v@@ ene in the framework of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients , which caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference frequency . &quot;
all patients participating in this study were submitted for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene before they were either amed on se@@ amed or continue to be e@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ om@@ ances between the beginning of the study and the screening period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also laid out the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin had been studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering caused by kidney issues , hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ om@@ inations were caused by patients who have been amed to se@@ amed in the same degree as for those patients who continue to be e@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to these patients , the continued e@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received a rise of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of wast@@ ew@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally cause symptoms of a enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ agn@@ ant mig@@ ache and confusion may lead . &quot;
&quot; wast@@ ew@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) was concluded that the drug has been informed according to the provisions of the European Union &apos;s regulations , that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ opause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high Fr@@ ak@@ tur@@ risks ( bone out@@ breaks ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a sli@@ des@@ y hip ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hips should be obtained before the first inf@@ usion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or through inj@@ ecting in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) just after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ al symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta the same is as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted for evaluating A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study nearly 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis , and it has been studied the number of sp@@ ine and hip re@@ plac@@ ements over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study carried out 2 127 men and women with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis more than 50 years , who had recently suffered a gir@@ affe ; it has been studied the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ates in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me that builds bone substance ) in the blood back norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the output .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ inal con@@ tours in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other o@@ steop@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ente ) has been reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients suffering of plac@@ ebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other o@@ steop@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ente ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hips was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip , 9 % of patients in A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated infection .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients which may possibly be over@@ sus@@ cep@@ tible ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ onate or any other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients in A@@ cl@@ asta to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information material for doctors ready to use the A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis which explains how the medicine must be used , as well as such material for patients , in which the side @-@ side effects of the drug should be explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis and o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , the administration of inf@@ usion by A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the operational supply of gir@@ der ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should be prescribed A@@ cl@@ asta only by physicians who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta has been observed a long re@@ mission period in patients who addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily with at least 500 mg of calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip , an Initi@@ al dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 is recommended by 50,000 or in@@ tra @-@ muscular vitamin D before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ denti@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min will not be recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( &gt; 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and eli@@ mination of older patients is similar to the younger . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta is in@@ suff@@ iciency in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) not recommended for these patient population only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is before starting the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta to deal with adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick inc@@ ision of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine emia , which usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta occurs ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily with at least 500 mg of calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

kidney dysfunction has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions which vo@@ iced as decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney function as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study at o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis over three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was observed by 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary calcium values , which were under normal fluctu@@ ations ( less than abundant m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2,3 % of with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial treated patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium found in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis , in the study for the prevention of clinical fr@@ act@@ ments after a gir@@ der and in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study for the prevention of clinical fr@@ act@@ ments after a recent conc@@ essions , the majority of patients were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , most of the patients received a initi@@ al@@ dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported by local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain @-@ strength and pain @-@ influenced compared to the output value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age .
patients who were classified at the end of the six@@ teenth report as a Res@@ p@@ onder ( on therapy was addressed ) were able to be included in a watch phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was compared with 71 of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of the re @-@ observed phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multi @-@ time 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic in 64 patients , the following pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ geon decreased quickly on &lt; 10 % of the peak after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

the early stages of sub @-@ phases ( α and β ( with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the quick res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the exp@@ ul@@ sion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
the overall body @-@ clearance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the inf@@ usion of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ g@@ äu@@ er - concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plas@@ ma centr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
&quot; decreased clearance by hydrogen to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or no direct and / or irrever@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;

it depends that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney dys@@ functions up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment to the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
there are only limited data for heavy kidney functioning ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity is the highest not let@@ tu@@ ally effective ret@@ do@@ sis in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , ret@@ ailer of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ unci@@ ation effect . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chron@@ ological and chron@@ ous toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous use has been administ@@ ered by doses of 0,@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , compared to the 6@@ am of the human therapeutic exposure , referred to the 7@@ times of human therapeutic exposure , referred to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , which is well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions which , the maximum of the intended Human @-@ exposure occurred sufficiently , occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ gue in@@ al@@ tr@@ act and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings and studies with repeti@@ tive application was a multip@@ lier spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ se of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a findings and that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive action of the substance . &quot;

&quot; a summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ges report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the committee has been evaluated in order to get recommendations on the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insul@@ in @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) , where Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ) is not shown . • It can be applied together with another conductor medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) . &quot;
&quot; it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a Sul@@ z@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insul@@ in , the previous dosage of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ material or insul@@ in may be retained by patients with Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced the dose of the sul@@ phone yl@@ har@@ ming , or insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s body can be improved in better and blood sugar levels , thus reducing type @-@ 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ ol@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition they received either accounts or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) is measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which means that the blood sugar consumption at the use of the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were cut . &quot;
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study the effect of additional gifts of accounts for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ ol@@ har@@ n@@ stoff in a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by sum % while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo at a reduction of 0.35 % .
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insul@@ in at 28@@ 9 patients were examined , patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to insul@@ in participated , compared to 0.7 % in patients compared to 0.7 % in patients who are in addition plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ th@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to stim@@ zen ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be applied in patients with patients which may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic c@@ eto@@ wers - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients in which Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission shared the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited was a permit for the transport of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the title &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also displayed for combining insul@@ in in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate in insufficient and in which Met@@ form@@ in due to contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations or intoler@@ ance is un@@ suitable ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering due to the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former coron@@ ary heart disease or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or est@@ rogen , especially those with reduced kar@@ di@@ al reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and est@@ rogen , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with insul@@ in . &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disorder has been performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of sei@@ zur@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency was revealed , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
patients with increased output levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x sky@@ line of standardi@@ zation ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
if the AL@@ T @-@ Spiegel are increased until 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the standardi@@ zation are increased to control the liver enzy@@ mes as soon as possible .
&quot; if a patient develops according to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , wa@@ vering , fatigue , appetite and / or dar@@ ker res@@ ins , are the liver enzy@@ me . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the patient treatment is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , should be led up to the extent of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been proven a dose @-@ dependent weight increase , which can be over@@ due in obesity and in some cases with a fluid @-@ ten@@ tion . &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ ost@@ ution appeared under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a low reduction of the mid hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ om@@ inations ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and insul@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.7 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insul@@ in sensitive cases in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or three @-@ fold combination therapy with insul@@ in @-@ carbon therapy with insul@@ in , the risk of dose @-@ dependent Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the launch was reported under the treatment of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about a appearance or deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms with a reduction of the vision . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ular doctors , though patients should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ ms ; a suitable ophthal@@ m@@ ologic evaluation should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages undes@@ irable events regarding bone health , controlled , dou@@ bling clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the right frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 fr@@ ak@@ tures for 100 patients of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with women and 1,@@ 1 fr@@ act@@ ments for women who were treated with compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.5 % ; 1.0 fr@@ act@@ ments per 100 patients ) of patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ tures for 100 patients ) patients treated with compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this entry is the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no relevant effects on the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics or Pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in exercises . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ ction ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased insul@@ in resistance to the mother@@ ti@@ eres and thereby reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rarely &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in turn , and counter @-@ sensitivity to the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ffer crossed over the triple of the norm@@ ality of the norm@@ alised sector often on the way under plac@@ ebo , but less than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in a out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disorder , the incidence of severe gas @-@ suff@@ ic@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was to be 1,6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the launch of the market , it has rarely been reported via gas @-@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insul@@ in or in patients with heart in@@ suff@@ iciency in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted in summary analysis of messages undes@@ irable events regarding bone health , controlled , dou@@ bl@@ blin@@ ded clinical studies on a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years running pro@@ active study , frames with 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; at intake of the maximum peak of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days had no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to work via activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( per@@ oxide Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased insul@@ in reaction of liver , fat and skel@@ etal cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the gl@@ uc@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ tance in case of insul@@ in resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8.6 % after the first 6 treatment products ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.3 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under gly@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ ed study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was employed in spite of three month @-@ phase Optimi@@ zation , with insul@@ in inadequate , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value around 0,45 % , compared to patients , which remains only insul@@ in ; a reduction of insul@@ in dose in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on group has been observed . &quot;
clinical trials over a year showed itself a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ cies compared to the output values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , in 18 weeks laid out investigation into type @-@ 2 di@@ ab@@ etic . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies were observed in comparison to plac@@ ebo a reduction of total plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids , and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ h@@ gly@@ ca@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
compared to plac@@ ebo there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased values .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , not only the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but improved also the cur@@ ving increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ mirror , this also has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ised with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , whereby the top @-@ cent@@ ric pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ actions studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics or Pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 Indu@@ s ) or lo@@ wers the plas@@ ma centr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral use of radio@@ active slopes pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mark@@ er was mainly found in f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the average plas@@ ma Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ery period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to the people 5 @-@ 6 hours and all of the active met@@ abolic rate is at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plas@@ ma @-@ concentr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abolic disorders are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function , whereby the edges of the oral Clear@@ ance of the Mother &apos;s sub@@ stan@@ cy are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies played in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys dis@@ agree after repeated administration of Plas@@ ma ution , ana@@ emia and rever@@ sible in@@ oc@@ entri@@ c heart hyper@@ trop@@ y . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in the design of hyper@@ insul@@ in and increased insul@@ in resistance to the mother@@ ti@@ eres and thereby reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was tested in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insul@@ in , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insul@@ in effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were as strong as with other human insul@@ in . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients which may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insul@@ in ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ ans have out@@ weigh the risks of diabetes compared to the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission shared the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the use of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
&quot; mixed insul@@ in products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initiated effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
inj@@ ecting needle must make at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar have improved significantly for example by an increased insul@@ in therapy significantly , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia cells can be altered and should be changed and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; each change with regard to strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insul@@ in yp ( fast acting , biological insul@@ in , human insul@@ in or insul@@ in an@@ alogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insul@@ in animal origin ) can cause that a change in dosage is necessary . &quot;
&quot; if the change to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an is required in the patient a dosage adjustment , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change from animal on human insul@@ in occurred , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is less pronounced or different from their previous insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; travelling , which are over several periods , the patient should be advised to take the Council of his doctor , since such trips can lead to that insul@@ in and meals have to be applied or taken into meals at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask for his patients following different medicines .

&quot; however , a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be developed in a way : • Easy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics can be treated by oral gl@@ uc@@ ose of gl@@ uc@@ ose and sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have sad@@ ness , sweets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sugar @-@ keeping fruit juices in itself . • Gra@@ vity Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection by glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a designated assistant or by gl@@ uc@@ ose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;

&quot; the dosage can be corrected both after and down , by turning the dosage op@@ tionally in the corresponding direction until the correct dose is opposite to the mark@@ er of the dosage . &quot;
&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ ask@@ marks ( &quot; stones &quot; ) , that can lead to artic@@ ulated and bon@@ sa@@ ig@@ ations ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary body s@@ ails after two to four weeks still lies more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased once every day 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment period , still g@@ ask@@ ets can occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients should take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still further drugs for prevention of g@@ ask@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ transpl@@ ant , as it was not examined for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , on which 1 0@@ 72 patients were participating , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic do@@ si@@ fications ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with the group of a plac@@ ebo ( search@@ camera ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once every day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract was placed under 6 mg / dl in the blood during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) patients who once daily took 120 mg in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart disease , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) have reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia in diseases that have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ grad@@ ations ( including one of the patient &apos;s history known or currently present g@@ ask@@ an and / or an G@@ ich@@ tar@@ thritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ packs after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still remains &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dosage increase to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , the effectiveness and security has not been completely investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people there are no experiences in children and young people , the application of Feb@@ ti@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; when there are no experiences in organ transpl@@ ant@@ ations , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases in patients with local cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart disease is not recommended for treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ ine@@ es@@ sm@@ ents medicines , it may occur during the treatment start to an acute seal , because by lowering the ser@@ um back@@ packs of first ur@@ inary deposits can be mobili@@ zed in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in rare cases is so far increasing that it comes to a deriv@@ ative in ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver diseases , while the clinical trials of phase 3 have been observed , slight symptoms of liver functioning in case of Feb@@ ti@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore advised to perform before starting the Feb@@ u@@ st@@ ine treatment and in further course depending on clinical findings and a liver operation ( see Section 5.1 ) .

pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies can not close any side effects from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or the health of Fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect detri@@ mental effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle that serve machines or exercise of dangerous activities until they may be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C has not imp@@ ly influenced their performance .

the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ r@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ th@@ ic or a de@@ com@@ promised heart in@@ suff@@ iciency in the patient &apos;s history .
&quot; frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects which could be reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg total treatment groups in a total of more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with Col@@ ors . * * In the clinical studies no serious skin attacks or severe over@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term studies in the open long @-@ term studies were 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients have been treated with Feb@@ ti@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years . &quot;
the events reported during long @-@ term - renewal studies were similar to which were reported in the studies of phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ti@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ti@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ time period studies ( up to 4 years with a Ex@@ posi@@ tional period of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to the information collected sometimes . &quot;

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary activity of primary activity was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three months of certain Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ packs &lt; 6.9 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serv@@ o of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed significant superi@@ ority of lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ packs under 6 mg / dl ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .

lowering the ser@@ um back@@ packs of &lt; 6.6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently maintain the entire treatment .
5@@ 09 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with Ser@@ um@@ cre@@ in@@ ine &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney dys@@ functions The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary interest rate at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in accordance with percentage of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ äu@@ re@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations in Pro@@ b@@ ans regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ s@@ lic@@ en@@ centr@@ ations &gt; 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( Bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um har@@ dening of &gt; 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years in the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease of the incidence of g@@ asket is yiel@@ ded that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a G@@ ich@@ ub ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ ask@@ dul@@ ar size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of g@@ ask@@ ose up to month 24 . &quot;
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,@@ 5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with Feb@@ ti@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ time pun@@ ctu@@ ation studies ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plas@@ ma @-@ centr@@ ations increased ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plas@@ ma @-@ cent@@ ric time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at after administration , simpler and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ dis@@ proportion@@ ate increase . &quot;
after in@@ ges@@ ting simple or multi@@ pler oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily is the C@@ max approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decline in ser@@ um har@@ n@@ s@@ lic@@ en@@ centr@@ ation has been tested , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The seem@@ ing ste@@ ady state volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plas@@ ma fee of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 99@@ ,@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is above the concentration of concentration , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro studies on human living micro@@ som@@ en showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic disorders demonstrated primarily by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ e@@ stat@@ on@@ cur@@ oni@@ d mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ edly found around 49 % of the dose in the urine as an un@@ changing Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic rate and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as further un@@ known met@@ abolic disorders ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the urine also found approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair as an un@@ changing Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic rate and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ abolic disorders ( 7 % ) . &quot;
special patients groups of kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency After the intake of multiple mg doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild to moderate or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency changed the C@@ max of Feb@@ ti@@ ost@@ at in relation to Pro@@ b@@ ans with normal kidney function .
the average total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at rose by about the 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function at 13.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe Ni@@ kl@@ ys@@ function .
12 Living Room After intake multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Child@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or indirectly ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification ) changed the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ abolic disorders not significantly compared to Pro@@ b@@ ans with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ abolic rate to intake multi@@ pler oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ met@@ abolic and urine composition and for clinical use as not relevant .
it has been determined that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fer@@ til@@ isation and reproduction capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were about 4,@@ 3@@ - times of human therapeutic exposure , the mat@@ ern@@ al toxic@@ ity came up with a reduction in rising performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in portable rats with exposure , which approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in portable rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions which bet@@ s about the 13 @-@ times of human therapeutic expos@@ ures , had no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis ( a disorder , in which the bone bro@@ ods are employed ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D level . &quot;
&quot; the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ ants ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid an irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines that are authorised in the European Union , the company placed data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steop@@ or@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D sp@@ y .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with a low vitamin D level was treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than with those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also placed data to show that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose is precisely the dose , which is required for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of diges@@ tive apparatus such as abdom@@ inal pain , dy@@ eing , v@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( blast@@ oc@@ ulation ) , stor@@ ul@@ ence ( blast@@ ema ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( thro@@ ws ) , infl@@ ated Ab@@ dom@@ es ( broken belly ) as well as su@@ ck@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ end@@ ron@@ age , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied for diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; Janu@@ ary@@ - 2007 , the European Commission shared the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. had approval for the use of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , characterized by the envel@@ ope of a button on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or take of medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ ades ) for the day to take . &quot;
following critics are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk for ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be lu@@ cked according to the advent of the day only with a full glass of water ( minimum 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a exists . • The patients should not take place before the first eating of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ del@@ ine ble@@ eding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ gue in@@ al@@ tr@@ act except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , are given only with special care ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; ec@@ soph@@ ist reactions , such as Ö@@ soph@@ ism , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sion , rare followed by ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age ( partly these severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms , which should indicate to potential th@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out , while the appearance of symptoms such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain , pain , or new or become mu@@ til@@ ated So@@ d@@ burn the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe th@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that point on a th@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all do@@ ckers are passed on to the patient and to be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk , were rarely ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reports ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pine , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regim@@ ents mainly intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the separation of a bis@@ phosph@@ ate therapy in patients who require a ki@@ os@@ surgical procedure , reduces the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pine . &quot;
clinical assessment by the prescri@@ bing doctor is relevant for treatment planning in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; patients should be dependent on the intake of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet next morning , after they have noticed their reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking one tablet each week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases that will affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ tism before the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE also ad@@ ä@@ qu@@ ate .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ age foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , Ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines can affect the remains of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore patients should wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interactions have not been conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies were taken jointly with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore is not used for pregnant women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ age leave no indication of directly har@@ ming effects regarding pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al or post @-@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pine was reported in patients with Bis@@ phosph@@ ates ; most reports have been reported from cancer patients but was also reported at o@@ steop@@ or@@ os@@ ep@@ ati@@ bility .

Adv@@ ag@@ raf is administ@@ ered adult patients to tran@@ script a kidney or liver in order to prevent a rep@@ ell@@ ation of the tran@@ script of the immune system by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft has already been deployed in the EU , the company has presented its results from previously published studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ raf were compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients who was dro@@ wned after a treatment duration of one year ( by looking for example how often a renewed organ transpl@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
&quot; in addition , no more studies have been carried out to 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and investig@@ ates how Adv@@ ant@@ raf is taken in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with recur@@ ring hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ag@@ raf since the Adv@@ ant@@ raf @-@ dose or the dose of the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

&quot; only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ant patients , should arrange this medicine or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transpl@@ ant canc@@ ers or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ ology . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; revers@@ als of wor@@ ding or the regime should only be carried out under the narro@@ wed control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and appropriate tin adap@@ tations must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ell@@ ation and toler@@ ability in individual case and on blood @-@ reflection ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ d@@ ations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as Tal@@ mirror , with both form@@ ulations both at Ni@@ er@@ und as well as live @-@ dro@@ wned patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive control of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ talent is recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant in Adv@@ ag@@ raf in order to ensure proper substance exposure in direct descendants phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase is not allowed to intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of conc@@ ent@@ arte for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) , with a dose of ca . &quot;
duration of the application of c@@ ur supp@@ ression of the transpl@@ ant@@ ment must be maintained ; consequently a maximum duration of oral therapy does not be specified .
tin recommendations - Ni@@ er@@ entr@@ an@@ spl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant Adv@@ ag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.20 - 19@@ mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further tin adap@@ tations can be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transpl@@ ant .
dosage intake - liver transpl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant Adv@@ ag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; tin recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a tran@@ splan@@ tion receiver from twice daily doses of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f , so this shift in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ raf once daily the treatment with each in Ni@@ er@@ en- und hep@@ atic transpl@@ ant is recommended for prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant@@ ment coverage .
&quot; heart transpl@@ ant When adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ raf is an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily at once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other Tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ at@@ receiver makes no clinical experience with Adv@@ ant@@ raf in lung , p@@ ank@@ ar and or@@ ectal cancer in a oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0,@@ 2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal tran@@ splan@@ ts from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to application . &quot;
tin adap@@ tations in special patients groups patients with reduced liver @-@ function z@@ ur maintenance of blood @-@ mirror in the growing area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions and dro@@ pping a dose of dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function since the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ at@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the Ser@@ um@@ at@@ ine level , a calculation of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ear@@ ance and supervision of the ur@@ inary tract ) recommended . &quot;
conversion from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ raf . switching from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations for the Tal@@ mirror in the full @-@ case The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ment and compatibility at the individual case of en@@ su@@ ing Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror checks . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to conduct frequent controls of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , followed during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c controls during therapy therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ talent of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change according to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , tin adap@@ table , changes for immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous use of substances that could change Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ full ble@@ eding ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical studies have been made to conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the Tal@@ mirror in the blood is 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
in clinical practice the Tal@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the age of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in case - and sav@@ aged patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent hal@@ ation therapy of liver , kidney and heart transpl@@ ant@@ ations were usually used blood @-@ centr@@ alised in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this led to serious unwanted events , including Tran@@ spl@@ ant@@ at@@ ants or other side @-@ effects which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Unter@@ - or Tran@@ scription . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; revers@@ als of wor@@ ding or the regime should only be carried out under the narro@@ wed control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ ant prevention , proved to be proven against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants as a ther@@ api@@ upp@@ res@@ sive form , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
to the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant@@ ment of the transpl@@ ant@@ ment of adol@@ escence and tran@@ splan@@ ts in the cinema there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
&quot; because of possible interactions , which can lead to a de@@ composition of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ rogen ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant healing during treatment with Adv@@ ant@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful surveillance of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood is offered because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood@@ stream under such circumstances can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases it was under Pro@@ gra@@ f a as cardi@@ omy@@ op@@ athy , or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing cardi@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , hydr@@ ation and pollution . &quot;
&quot; like with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the impact of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be restricted by suitable clothes or use of a sun protection using a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; when patients suffering the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for P@@ RES such as head@@ aches , changed awareness , cr@@ amps and visual defects should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ raf carbide , re@@ tar@@ ded , lam@@ act@@ ose included , is available in patients with the rare fr@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , L@@ act@@ ase @-@ deficiency or gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicine known as Hem@@ mer or indu@@ s of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood level in the same gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was made with an@@ tim@@ yk@@ oti@@ ves such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol , as well as with the Macro@@ lid in@@ antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ protest . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics studies assumed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhi@@ bit of gast@@ ro@@ lim@@ atic metabolism , results . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ quality pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute pl@@ ying operations , can increase or reduce the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; effect from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abo@@ li@@ zes , whose metabolism may affect . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us put down the clearing of ster@@ oid @-@ contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a and thus can increase the hormonal exposure , is particularly careful in decisions about observ@@ able measures particularly carefully . &quot;
the results of veterin@@ arians have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of studies on transpl@@ ant patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants is an increased risk to unwanted events regarding the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o Ex@@ position , monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns on any dam@@ aging effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
there is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ tension of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 Neu@@ born ) i.e. :

cases of B@@ K @-@ Virus @-@ Associ@@ ated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associate multi @-@ fo@@ al leu@@ co@@ enc@@ ephal@@ op@@ athy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
it has been reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ tics including EB@@ V@@ - Associ@@ ated lymp@@ ho@@ bic diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ sol@@ uble and the high bond of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ one can be accepted that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
&quot; mechanism and pharmac@@ ogen@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be convey@@ ed the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its bond to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ical protein . ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucle@@ us . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent Hem@@ aming of Sign@@ al@@ trans@@ duction because in the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a particular range of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII @-@ conditioned , inn@@ ate blood loss ) . &quot;
dosage and frequency of application are based upon whether Adv@@ ate is applied for the treatment of ble@@ eding or the prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , which causes ble@@ eding problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , that it allows for the formation of the human scent factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is approved by another in the European Union approved medicines called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but will be different , so that the drug does not contain proteins , or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined as well as surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was assessed at the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients which may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster , or any of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 shared the European Commission of B@@ ax@@ ter AG approved approval for the integration of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy will be directed after the sever@@ ance of the factor VIII , according to the place and extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ orrho@@ ea events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period is not under the stated Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repe@@ ating until the p@@ ains and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger to patients is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , for controlling the inj@@ ecting dose and frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ds is stim@@ ulated . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different semi @-@ value times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 that is to be given by factor VIII per kg body weight at the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the anticipated factor VIII @-@ plas@@ ma @-@ activities will not be achieved or if the blood is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ or values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be noticed . &quot;
&quot; the delivery speed should be directed after the patient &apos;s ability , whereby a maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plas@@ ma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk to develop inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the scale of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positioning days is on the largest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( P@@ TP@@ s ) with more than 100 extru@@ ders and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , observed by ( low @-@ tri@@ angles ) In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare appearance of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding is no experience . &quot;
&quot; the patients applied in the greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which appeared to patients with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each of 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first official view of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has been rated as a positive consequence , but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored closely for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the safety pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ T every 6 months , decided that the filing for 5 years has to apply for a further renewal procedure . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) that the company resign@@ ed its request for the use of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue , the other structures in the body combines , surrounds and base ) . &quot;
&quot; this is a type of virus that has changed gene@@ tically , it can be a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ exin is a &quot; &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been changed so that there is no copies of itself and cannot trigger any infections in humans . &quot;
advoc@@ acy could have been pun@@ ched directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is made out of the not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company placed data from a study involving a patient in front of the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ tree , into the bones , and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company on him , there were still some questions uns@@ ol@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; based on the inspection of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP was created on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ exin in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Tum@@ ore takes advantage for the patients . &quot;
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug through the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advoc@@ acy can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company was not aware of the CH@@ MP whether it has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ exin . &quot;
changed drug @-@ release means that the tablets are so mer@@ ged that one of the effective components is instantly released and the other slowly has been released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal fluctu@@ ating rh@@ initi@@ s ( h@@ ay fever caused by allergy to poll@@ en @-@ borne inflammation of the nose @-@ way ) in patients with nas@@ en@@ dar@@ s @-@ skin @-@ swelling ( co@@ op@@ more nose ) .
in adults and young people aged 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet every day with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the Nas@@ en@@ schl@@ eim@@ kin ( pet@@ ted nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be be@@ ating on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main effective dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay of h@@ ay symptoms , which have been reported by patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study , patients bore their symptoms all 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard sc@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms have been in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; with viewing all h@@ ay symptoms , besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , about a decrease of symptoms by 46,@@ 0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in the patient , the pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone took . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the Nas@@ en@@ schl@@ eim@@ ina was considered , patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7.2 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in patients suffering from des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( cardi@@ ology ) , harmon@@ ization , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ ability ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ ability ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is allowed to patients who may be over@@ sus@@ cep@@ tible ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ aline , or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine to treat allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bot@@ angle glau@@ coma ( terrible water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension caused by the brain ) or have already had a risk of hem@@ orrho@@ ea stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission of SP Europe shared a permit for the in@@ feed of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to sw@@ allow up in the whole ( i.e. without it to cr@@ ush , break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied to children under 12 years due to failure ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after dis@@ closing the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time on 10 days , since long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the sli@@ ding lo@@ wing in the upper breath@@ s , the treatment can be continued with des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contr@@ ain@@ dicated in patients suffering with a mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ant ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after the termin@@ ation of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attri@@ but@@ able to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine like Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Persian , cab@@ ine or nas@@ al , phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , Eph@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
security and effectiveness of these com@@ bin@@ ations were not tested for this patient treatment and the data are not enough to speak corresponding recommendations for dosage .
safety and the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ functional and the data are not enough to speak corresponding recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about that treatment at appearance of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ mia , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; in treating the following patient groups , patients under digital is • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ kt in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is able to reduce dermat@@ ological tests at least 48 hours before the implementation of dermat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can prevent otherwise beneficial effects on hood actions or reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered , however , were not observed clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plas@@ tic@@ ular de@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients regardless of whether des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin has been taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzy@@ mes is not yet identified for the met@@ abolic disorders of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin enzy@@ me , so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely eliminated . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not hem@@ med and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gl@@ y@@ kop@@ rot@@ one .
&quot; the uncertainty of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the incidence of normal population . &quot;
since reaction studies of animals are not always transferred to humans and because of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ical characteristics of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy .
&quot; patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated , however , that in very rare cases , it may come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to an impair@@ ment of per@@ sever@@ ation or the ability to serve machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ aling , ap@@ nea , minim@@ ized mental attention , cy@@ ani@@ ans , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ ations ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation , Tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with potential let@@ ter@@ ing fur@@ n@@ aces . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , ag@@ ony compl@@ aining , muscle weakness , and increased muscle voltage , eu@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ the , pal@@ pit@@ ations , du@@ ling , fl@@ aw@@ ful pain , s@@ win@@ dle , Tinnitus , at@@ ax@@ y , visual dys@@ functions and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely , as well as A@@ tropical in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , p@@ up@@ lift@@ able and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin tr@@ ö@@ y , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ omm@@ ates symptoms ) . &quot;
these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ cl@@ or@@ ical cy@@ to@@ k@@ ins such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhi@@ bit of the expression of the failure of the &quot; &quot; failure &quot; &quot; P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ic cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg does not have any influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks connected to the subject . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies have been fixed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily with no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can give more lik@@ om@@ able effect effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ or or manifestation of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; it received 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall cor@@ es for symptoms ( except rhin@@ oc@@ ular sul@@ len ) , significantly higher than among mon@@ otherapy with Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ating effect , determined by the nose @-@ sli@@ gh@@ tening effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
in the framework of a single dose @-@ study on pharmac@@ ogen@@ s of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after administration in plas@@ ma .
after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the barrel @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adin and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine has reached day 10 . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study , which has been performed with the wor@@ ding as tablet an healthy adult pro@@ b@@ ans , was found that four prob@@ es des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin is poorly influenced . &quot;
an component study study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) by Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole gift of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ ci@@ equivalent was a position after the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ read@@ ology , to toxic@@ ity in repeated gi@@ sts , to gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for reproductive cancer , however , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ chlor@@ ine adin has no particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination poss@@ essed no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally linked to the ingredient pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive medicine the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ at@@ ogenic .

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 6 to eleven years the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies at seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and the capacity in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body is the sy@@ rup , the solution to the entry and mel@@ ting storage in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were gathered together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to an average rate of symptom ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26 % in patients who received plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us must not be applied in patients which may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission of SP Europe shared a permit for trading of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reli@@ eving the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in youths from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ iors allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done accordingly to the previous disease progression and can end up after the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at their resume .
&quot; in the Persian rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms , 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the aller@@ gen period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been observed in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in simultaneous in@@ ges@@ ting of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated , however , that in very rare cases , it may come to ben@@ z@@ zin@@ ess that can lead to a impair@@ ment of per@@ sever@@ ation or the ability to serve machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently reported side effects , reported on the more common than with plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 578 y@@ outh@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.5 % of patients who were treated with des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin and were treated with 6,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ multi @-@ dose study , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg Des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dosage ) have been administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ cl@@ or@@ ical cy@@ to@@ k@@ ins such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhi@@ bit of the expression of the failure of the evil molec@@ ule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage varies from up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dosage ) over ten days was administ@@ ered , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dos@@ is@@ - trial with adults showed des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening subjective wei@@ ght@@ iness or the tasks connected to the subject . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ch of nose , it@@ ri@@ ties and redness of eyes as well as rejo@@ icing on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as on the basis of the whole cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aires of the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ jun@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis has been shown , dimin@@ ished a@@ eri@@ us effectively the caused by seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s on the basis of seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was being investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ological biology in the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easier prosp@@ ectively . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ amine removal is a urs@@ ory factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ultur@@ al disorders , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has also been corro@@ bor@@ ated in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria into an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the de@@ composition of size and number of squares at the end of the first dosage interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka at chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who are not on anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka re@@ acted , out of the study . &quot;
an improvement of the it@@ ri@@ pen@@ es around more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with an@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and consciousness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients @-@ demo@@ s with the general seasonal fluctu@@ ating rh@@ initi@@ s were comparable to 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no evidence points for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzy@@ me used for the met@@ abolic disorders of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin enzy@@ me has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely eliminated . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not hem@@ med and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gl@@ y@@ kop@@ rot@@ one .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not affect the availability of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
the clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin conducted in a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the toxic@@ ity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and of Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ read@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ ability , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for the reproductive medicine , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin leave no special risks to humans . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s may be caused by infection under 2 years ( see below section 4.4 ) and that no data exists that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with an@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ alies should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin testing . &quot;
&quot; about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years , met@@ abolic disorders are limited and experienced a higher sub@@ stitution load ( see below section 5.2 ) . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in simultaneous in@@ ges@@ ting of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the total population of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ ups group like the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ domain study of adults and juven@@ iles , which were administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of des@@ ol@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine in question , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ do@@ sis of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the substance data of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin can be extrac@@ ted in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multi @-@ expert in adults and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily is applied over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and juven@@ iles , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage applied by 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dosage ) over ten days at adults showed itself no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and young people have found no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; during single single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets resulted in clinical trials for adult or young people in clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous in@@ ges@@ tion of alcohol suffered neither to a rein@@ forcement of alcohol @-@ in@@ duced power , nor to an increase in the sle@@ ep@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were a@@ eri@@ us tablets effective in all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ch of nose , it@@ ri@@ ties and redness of eyes as well as rejo@@ icing on the pal@@ ate . &quot;

&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ov@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ professional study conducted in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that constra@@ ined met@@ abolic disorders .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was approximately 6@@ mal higher than 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half @-@ time period of about 120 hours .
there are no evidence points for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient g@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days with adults and juven@@ iles .
&quot; 12 In different retail studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzy@@ me used for the met@@ abolic disorders of des@@ ol@@ at@@ adin enzy@@ me has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely eliminated . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us solution to entry is displayed for children aged between 1 and 11 years , young people ( 12 years and older ) and adults , elderly people included . &quot;
&quot; if the solution for entry to entry is attached to entry with sc@@ aling , you can use this alternative to take the appropriate amount of solution to take . &quot;
&quot; regarding treatment duration , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , under which you suffer and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution to take . &quot;
&quot; however , with children under 2 years of diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness were frequent effects during adult fatigue , mouth dry and head@@ aches more often than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; 97 A@@ eri@@ us solution to entry is available in bottles with child safe wear board with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. is officially approved by the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ isions ( CH@@ MP ) to the Prevention of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A @-@ Virus . &quot;
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to man because the people have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system of the parts of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus as being &quot; physical @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form a contact with a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus of this Stam@@ ms quicker antibodies .
&quot; then , the Membran@@ e of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface anti @-@ gen@@ ous &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , that the human body can be det@@ ained as body @-@ foreign ) , and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; a inspection of some of the study group showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA guidelines for prehistoric vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your treat@@ able physician . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the based recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for treating adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immune @-@ weak@@ ening of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ ological syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot sw@@ allow the capsules , stands v@@ gener@@ ase as a solution for admission , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination is not examined . &quot;
&quot; an gener@@ ase should only be sub@@ ordin@@ ated if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral medicines of the patient has been taken , and the probability that the virus can appeal to the medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily that are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces in@@ ges@@ ting in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS does not cure to cure , however , may delay the immune system and therefore also delay the development of associated with AIDS infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which previously did not have been treated with protest . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ ghted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines of generic medicines was compared with 206 adults , which had previously encountered previously protests . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ documented concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of viral burden after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ eas@@ ers , although after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a virus weight below 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but an@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children the an@@ gener@@ ase was also reduced the virus last but , however , of the children who were previously treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , were only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ers , lo@@ wered that with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the virus @-@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ants resistance , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of viral last after four weeks as with the patients having received their previous protests . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blood vessels ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Ill@@ nesses ( ti@@ redness ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients which may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; generic medicines may also not be applied in patients , cur@@ rants ( herbal medication used for treating depression ) or medicines that are just like an@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines to HIV , in patients who are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( def@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that will be caused by the changing immune system ) . &quot;
the committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that the benefits of generic medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; an@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee asked that the benefits of as@@ o@@ ase is taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a protest . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances because at the time of permission for scientific reasons only limited information .
October 2000 European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited was a permit for the trading of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1- infected , Prot@@ eas@@ e.@@ PI ( PI ) treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , generic capsules are supposed to be administ@@ ered for pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to entry is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , are an@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for generic capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied addi@@ tive supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) must be applied higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a day of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
Pharmac@@ opo@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ o@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other protests in children were not examined . &quot;
&quot; generic is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to in@@ consistency and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ os@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of generic capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is intended to use in patients with mild or more liver @-@ functional , with caution in patients with severe pain @-@ functioning , it is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cycle ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk reduction of plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , an generic capsules should be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and be treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral composite therapy and have a higher risk of severe liver effects with potentially deadly disease .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with existing li@@ vable liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on or other gl@@ uc@@ co @-@ stero@@ ids that is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ rug@@ ated effects , including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function out@@ weighs ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ er Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is subject to a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opathic including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen not recommended .
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective due to decreased plastic bag from Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrast can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on ob@@ sc@@ at@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col , this formulation is contr@@ ain@@ dicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
a gener@@ ase should be set on duration 5 if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ers , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gl@@ yk@@ emia or an ex@@ trac@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other conditions regarding their therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gl@@ yk@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , reports are about an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous jun@@ ctions and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
on HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial Equ@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ tical stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ o@@ ids , higher body Mass @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose have been reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of generic are not allowed to have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cycle ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of generic m@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicinal products whose active ingredients are primarily connected to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ingredients and are connected to the increased plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ d with heavy and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a res@@ ili@@ ence development .
&quot; in trying to equ@@ alled the reduced plastic bag by a dosage increase in other prototype inhibit@@ ors , in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very often undes@@ irable effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient already takes a cur@@ rant , the am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror , are the am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ ally and , if possible , to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and de@@ du@@ ce the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see also em@@ avi@@ r@@ ence below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this therapy . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min @-@ Values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r at Plas@@ ma ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administ@@ ered .
&quot; a lectur@@ er recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a narro@@ wed monitoring since the effectiveness and discomfort of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended because of the har@@ vest@@ ing component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase it lies at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore at G@@ hub of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment .
the treatment with matri@@ mon@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants could be reduced .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other types of release and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r may be sen@@ sed .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable to be less effective because of the decrease , and may possibly be sub@@ therapeutic Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel less effective . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of combining Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plas@@ ma centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin around 193 % and thus to a rise in associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with an@@ gener@@ ase is administ@@ ered along with as@@ so@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out but could be the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel of both medicine in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ il@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily with no simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r once daily .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below are including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or indu@@ s of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with an@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be applied to toxic responses which are associated with these medicines when they are applied in combination with an@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other protests , it is advisable that Ant@@ azi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as an@@ gener@@ ase , since it may come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of antibodies known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plas@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ ds such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , peri@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ eu@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase 10 by am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine . &quot;
simultaneous in@@ ges@@ ting with as@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plas@@ ma @-@ centr@@ ations and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ b@@ ans , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ ate Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval all 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended along with these gluten @-@ stero@@ ids , unless the possible benefits of a treatment risk the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is dependent , are distinctive enh@@ ancements of the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel in simultaneous administration of an@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ers increases this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ op@@ athy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines will not be recommended with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations until the stabil@@ isation of the mirror is recommended as the plas@@ ma centr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ers are evidence of a possible rise in the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ at@@ ar@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low loading of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is to be given as Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to custom@@ ize when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; at the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies along with an@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International normal rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ toxic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predic@@ tible , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption is recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous use of an@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk l@@ acti@@ le rats , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r goes into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a Re@@ production study of impair@@ ments that was administ@@ ered by acquiring in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the neighbour .
the further development of perfection including Fer@@ til@@ isation and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier .
the intoler@@ ance of generic medicines was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most with the anti @-@ generic @-@ treatment associated side effects were slightly to moderate , occurred early on and rarely resulted in the treatment break . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clear whether they are applied in connection with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the atro@@ cious disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the listed side effects come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ eas@@ ants , patients 1200 mg of generic patients received twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grad 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ator than in connection with the study of study , and in more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment laboratory studies ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body @-@ condition ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patient , including a loss of periph@@ er@@ em and fa@@ form@@ ous fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hia , hyper@@ trop@@ hies of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal li@@ pos@@ al collection ( pen ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ actively , not previously untreated persons who were treated with am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only been observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 appeared in 245 NR@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various NR@@ TI@@ s on a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin attacks were usually slightly to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mak@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ou@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ch and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors ( advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral compromise therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; with PI patients treated 600 mg of gener@@ ase twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ ghted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and lab changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and lab changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and lab changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) , and CP@@ K values associated with patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase combined with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently appeared . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ cation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , are required support measures . &quot;

in treating anti@@ retro@@ actively patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r do@@ zens have been observed - as with other k@@ on@@ avi@@ r counter @-@ inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; at six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ actively treated patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 732 , came up twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 732 . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of insul@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logic failure within the 59 included patients were not previously treated patients , showed Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) to patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure more than 96 weeks , the following rel@@ eas@@ ants mut@@ ations on : &quot;
on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ based analysis Gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied to the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ t@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ers @-@ resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ v@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V / M / S / T / V / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a increased phenomen@@ al resistance on Fos@@ t@@ avi@@ r , as well as a decreased lik@@ eli@@ hood of a vi@@ ro@@ logic response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation sm@@ iles can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of res@@ ili@@ ation testing . &quot;
on ph@@ el@@ otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ based analysis clin@@ ically vali@@ dated ph@@ leg@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ i@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ers @-@ resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .
firms to distribute diagnostic resistance testing products have developed clin@@ ically @-@ ph@@ an@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a residential test .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ated gene@@ tically patterns produces a certain cru@@ ising resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r , but generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross@@ bow between Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and other protests orders for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ sten@@ cy , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ actively patients treated with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , C@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant insulation ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isolation . &quot;
the early break @-@ off of a vers@@ ed therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits which can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of as@@ o@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the trial of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , an random@@ ized open study , in which with PI previously treated adults ( standard TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly received with low @-@ level Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ een times ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least a NR@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis provided the non @-@ cap@@ tion of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time period ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Plas@@ ma last ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ lower wave of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of non @-@ baked chemical gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controll@@ able studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , from which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies as@@ gener@@ ase solution was tested and capsules in doses from 15 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice a day and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice a day , where the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
it was not given a low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks the patients received a plas@@ ma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output rating .
&quot; 19 Basi@@ lic@@ ating on this data should be considered in the therapy optim@@ isation , with PI the children treated to the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ used &quot; ab@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
5@@ 08 % increases for C@@ max compared to 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % of de@@ duction of AU@@ C , but has no effect on concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and the rate of the res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the seem@@ ing volume is about 430 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a big distribution volume , as well as a tremendous penetration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the active ingredient in plas@@ ma , whereby the amount of un@@ broken Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of irregular Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of the free active component occur during the market segment in the Ste@@ ady state in the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; hence , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 will be administ@@ ered with caution when they are given simultaneously with an@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ vou@@ chers than from the capsules ; hence the an@@ gener@@ ase solution and an@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance is neglected by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , therefore the impact of a kidney function is likely to be low on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ eg@@ s comparable to those that are obtained in healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the pul@@ ero@@ gen@@ eit@@ y with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats occurred in male animals , on the 2,@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ rop@@ ular aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on humans , both from clinical studies and of the therapeutic application , however , there was little evidence of adop@@ ting a clinical relevance of this findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity testing , the bacter@@ ium Scre@@ ening test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes hal@@ ved , was am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical use by AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so far , in clinical studies have not been observed any significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients , neither during the administration of an@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies of the toxic@@ ity in young animals that were treated at young age , which were treated with both the check@@ ups and with the Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r treated animals as well as with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with a system@@ ic plas@@ ma Ex@@ pos@@ ure , which was significant under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significant higher ( rats ) than the expected ex@@ position under therapeutic dosage , but were observed a number of low @-@ term changes including t@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and sli@@ mming skel@@ eton , which refer to a consuming development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If an gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied addi@@ tive supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for generic capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a day of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is intended to use in patients with more vig@@ or or light liver dysfunction , in patients with severe pain @-@ functioning it is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
a gener@@ ase should be set on duration 27 if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addi@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a res@@ ili@@ ence development .
5@@ 08 % increases when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min @-@ Values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r at Plas@@ ma ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administ@@ ered .
&quot; a lectur@@ er recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a narro@@ wed monitoring since the effectiveness and discomfort of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with matri@@ mon@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants could be reduced .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of combining Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with an@@ gener@@ ase is to be administ@@ ered , becomes a reduction of dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ ds such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , peri@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ eu@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase through am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ b@@ ans , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ ate Plas@@ tic@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval all 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies along with an@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International normal rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ toxic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ es@@ tradi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a Re@@ production study of impair@@ ments that was administ@@ ered by the listing in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the after@@ math .

&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ cation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , are required support measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % of Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ak@@ ut infected cells and amounts to 6@@ µ@@ M at chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant insulation ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isolation . &quot;
&quot; based on this data should be considered in the treatment of therapy with PI children , the benefit of &quot; un@@ used &quot; ab@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of irregular Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of the free active component occur during the market segment in the Ste@@ ady state in the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; hence , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 will be administ@@ ered with caution when they are given simultaneously with an@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neglected ; therefore the impact of a kidney function is likely to be low on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the pul@@ ero@@ gen@@ eit@@ y with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats occurred in male animals , on the 2,@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular Aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on people , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity testing , the bacter@@ ium Scre@@ ening test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kern@@ els of rats and chromos@@ ome specimen , am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies of the toxic@@ ity in young animals that were treated at young age , which were treated with both the check@@ ups and with the Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r treated animals as well as with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results conclude that in Jung@@ le the met@@ abolic path@@ ways have not yet fully mature , so that Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; a generic solution for entry is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , Prot@@ eas@@ ef@@ mer ( PI ) treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; E@@ gener@@ ase solution to entry was neither treated with PI patients nor PI patients treated with PI patients .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to entry is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , are an@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be able to sw@@ allow the capsules to sw@@ allow the capsules with the intake of solving the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.9 ml ) Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no dosage intake for the simultaneous use of as@@ generic solution to inhal@@ ing and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to be avoided this combination with these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a tin adap@@ table for am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for necessary , is an application of a generic solution for entry in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col is an generic solution for entry in small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver disease , and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a com@@ peti@@ tive in@@ hibition of the met@@ abolic disorder and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects as heart rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it continues to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with an@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for several medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
a gener@@ ase should be dropped on duration when a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ and 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , reports are about an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous jun@@ ctions and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a res@@ ili@@ ence development .
5@@ 08 % increases when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .

on the basis of data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are significantly higher according to or@@ ative gift by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plas@@ ma centr@@ ations taken by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known as a generic solution to entry may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of fet@@ us on the conn@@ ect@@ engl@@ y@@ col not during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk l@@ acti@@ le rats , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r goes into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a Re@@ production study of impair@@ ments that was administ@@ ered by acquiring in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight in the after@@ math .
the intoler@@ ance of generic medicines was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clear whether they are applied in connection with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the atro@@ cious disease . &quot;
in treating anti@@ retro@@ actively patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r do@@ zens have been observed - as with other k@@ on@@ avi@@ r counter @-@ inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .

your doctor will normally indicate an@@ as@@ ase capsules along with low doses Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effect of as@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of a gener@@ ase is based on your doctor for you with an individual viral test and your treatment of treatment .
&quot; inform your doctor , if you are suffering from any of the above disorders or take any of the drugs above . &quot;
&quot; if your doctor advised that you have generic capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to rein@@ forcement the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure that you have read carefully before the beginning of the treatment the used information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; just as well , do not provide adequate information to cover the use of generic capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients with 50 kg body weight . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is important that you can read the section &quot; When taking as@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; before you start with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; possibly you need additional factor VIII to control the blood flow . − In patients who receive an anti@@ retro@@ viral composite therapy , can occur a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat . &quot;

the application @-@ frequency and the duration of treatment with al@@ dara depend on the treating disease from : • At times in the genital area Al@@ dara is to carry up to a maximum of 16 weeks for a maximum of 16 weeks . • At ak@@ tin@@ ess ker@@ at@@ ants she is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles to aband@@ on three times weekly .
&quot; the cream is th@@ inner before bed@@ time thin to wear the affected skin area , so that they have enough long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete cooling of the treated War@@ zen . • Al@@ dara was also examined to 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma during which the patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dara or plac@@ ebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with full recur@@ r@@ age of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in a total of 5@@ 05 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • At the treatment of warm studies 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with al@@ dara patients , but only 3 % to 18 % of patients treated with al@@ dara patients treated compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effects of al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream is as long as continue , until all visible out@@ war@@ ts in genital or periods are gone , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
a break in the above described treatment should be weigh@@ ed if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when the treatment range is observed an infection .
&quot; when the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , a different therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; in the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is much higher risk for heavy local hood . ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed under fac@@ ili@@ ent application of heavy local prot@@ ections , which made a treatment required and / or resulted in temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty in the water , which made a emergency cath@@ eter and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;

local Hau@@ tre@@ aches are common but the intensity of these reactions occur in general during therapy or the reactions form their treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if it is necessary because of the symptoms of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local farmers , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy may be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .

data from an open clinical trial suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ess ker@@ at@@ ants in the inside of the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the Li@@ p .
there are only very limited data regarding the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ants to anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the sc@@ alp .
&quot; the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ cal ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower and hands support the effectiveness in this application purpose , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local Hau@@ tre@@ ach frequently occur but these reactions are usually taken over the course of the treatment of intensity or go back after the therapy with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if local grasp of the patient are great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AJ@@ SC releases a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating attributes , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ am should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; in the study mainly the security of the drug was examined , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by exam@@ ining its effect on reducing the gene concentr@@ ations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG conc@@ entri@@ c concentr@@ ations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the patients were consumed at the end of the study a normal big liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , pain , pain , pain , fever in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat emp@@ athy and reactions to the inf@@ usion set . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a scanning size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ the ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other ingredients ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) is given every year all new information that may be known , check and this summary required . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is preserved to patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; June 2003 , the European Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. distributed a permit for the use of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ en α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is available for long @-@ time enzy@@ mes in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ outlet I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) indicator that treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor which has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be if the patient gets this toler@@ ated all 15 minutes into individual steps on a maximum score of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reactions which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion . ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be monitored narro@@ wed down , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be made available only in a reasonable clinical environment , in the re@@ plac@@ ental institutions for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients are Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reaction , must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as little experience ahead regarding the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break is , due to the theoretical risk of hyper@@ sensitivity to a break of treatment have been cau@@ tious . &quot;
60 minutes before the beginning of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or Anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential appearance of inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reactions .
in the case of a slight or medium @-@ severe inf@@ usion reaction the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be stir@@ red up and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate at half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
&quot; in the case of a single , serious inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reaction the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , a treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is too p@@ onder@@ ing . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be recorded with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 the inf@@ usion rate in which the fores@@ een reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect implications for pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data for new@@ bor@@ ns who were exposed to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to satisfy during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the side @-@ effects in clinical studies were assessed mainly as inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reaction which were observed by 53 % of patients in the phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; undes@@ irable medicines related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3 years or older at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years ; frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ condi@@ tional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , there appeared heavy reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , respiratory and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s desired medication effects related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study conducted with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with a majority of severe delay , and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in most patients there came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical version within 3 months after the treatment during the age of 5 , with a severe delay form ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) were in 13 / 45 patients no by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ osi@@ ties ( Rip ) As@@ say veri@@ fiable antibodies before , among which there was never a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with faul@@ ted up to lower anti @-@ antibodies in the Har@@ n in Har@@ n during patients with high antibodies in Har@@ n was determined during patients with high antibodies in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally until low neutr@@ alised inhibit@@ or effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ v@@ ein activity in vit@@ ro who did not affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed to be found in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable medicines , even if the appearance of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical companies typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for the enzy@@ me treatment lies in one for the hydro@@ lys@@ ses of the accumulation of accumulation and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzy@@ mes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly taken from the cycle and taken by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients have been recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of the patients were raised by the medium phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients have been recru@@ ited when they had an for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ closure in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients have subsequently been en@@ rolled for an Open @-@ label verification study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group an improvement of the lung function and the in@@ solven@@ cy , shown in the following table . &quot;
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as seen from the following table .
the acceptance of the percentage percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased in proportion to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with an atom@@ atom@@ ized of treatment achieved 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first four weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel has been fixed in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) who remained constant to the degree of study .
&quot; regarding the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous path@@ ogen@@ s between patients , which was considered by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes in common for five patients ( 58 % ) , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
it was conducted a one @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study where mainly the security and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with heavy distor@@ tion form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased due to increase G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in case of several patients , a size of size ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental stage speed for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle age point have been limited , whereas in the older patients with severe infection @-@ form only limited or no advances in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 @-@ 4 study exam@@ ines a pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ do@@ et@@ schem@@ ata at the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; the Do@@ automation scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may present in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ ele@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ ability and reproductive medicine , the pre@@ clinical data do not recognise special risks to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no famili@@ arity studies have been conducted , this medicine should not be mixed with other medicines except with the less than 6.@@ 6. listed below . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used along with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug against cancer ) in patients who have not res@@ ign any chemotherapy ( drug against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or spreads easily to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously had previously used other chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , in addition , prior to or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drug against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liqui@@ ds ( to bow a liquid angel ) . &quot;

&quot; the active form of panic attack , thus slo@@ ws down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide . &quot;
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form goes easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells that leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of medicine and a longer active time in cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ s Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had not received chemotherapy against their disease before . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated with a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which has previously been treated with chemotherapy ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12,@@ 1 month , compared to 9,@@ 3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7,@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , patients , in which cancer do not attack the SC@@ C cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival times than with the similar medicine . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission of the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. had a permit for the in@@ stig@@ ation of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .

&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of Hau@@ tre@@ ach , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ tical oid is given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid and intake must be continued during the entire therapy season , as well as for more 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need an in@@ tra @-@ muscular inj@@ ecting vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third place of operation .
&quot; in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created prior to each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a ro@@ mbo@@ lic counting . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a tin @-@ examination must be held under reporting of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood@@ shot or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Moor@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC Grad 2 blood pressure .
should patients no @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity &gt; degrees 3 develop ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) must be interrupted for therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value in front of the treatment

clinical studies no indication that patients at the age of 65 year@@ s@@ ors or in comparison to patients aged 65 years old is an increased risk risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data on uncertainty and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of &gt; 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment needed to go beyond the dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations for all patients .
&quot; the data location in patients with a credit @-@ clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients with a liver im@@ pregn@@ ation of &gt; The 1.5 @-@ times of the upper b@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ ds and / or tran@@ sam@@ ase values ( with respect of liver metastatic breast cancer ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limits ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) not specifically examined in the studies . &quot;
patients need to be super@@ vised with regard to the Kno@@ wing soup and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administ@@ ered in patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ ils are again a value of &gt; 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ died is once again achieved a value of &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ age number and maxim@@ ally non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as they were observed in previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and reduction of the degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y and infection with degrees 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y was desp@@ ised when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
therefore all patients need to be instruc@@ ted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients to use fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduction @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous in@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sali@@ ka ( &gt; 1,3 per day ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients who fores@@ een a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed needs to prevent the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , avoiding the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of the shot in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment will be wo@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ es , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of shadow ( except yellow , these vacc@@ ination is contr@@ ain@@ dicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of a irrever@@ sible sk@@ ull of reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed &apos;s reproductive capacity , men should be advised before treatment of treatment to obtain advice on sperm conservation . &quot;

&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ eu@@ vre spots at After , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with stu@@ d@@ lab@@ s , stu@@ d@@ ded chair , de@@ mis@@ sive secre@@ tion ( f@@ eces ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be applied in patients who are treated with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ rep@@ ul@@ atory in transpl@@ ant patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ears .
it must also not be applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term painter syndrome ( with which does not have enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract ) or on chol@@ est@@ ase ( one liver illness ) or in pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers .
July 2007 the European Commission of G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited shared a permit for the use of Or@@ der@@ at G@@ SK in the entire European Union .
alli is to be applied to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI &gt; 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ ical or fet@@ al diet .
&quot; alli must not be applied by children and young people under 18 , as not enough data on the effectiveness and safety . &quot;
&quot; since Or@@ list@@ at , however , is only minimal res@@ or@@ ated , is at older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adaptation of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chron@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of the occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ al symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if alli is taken together with a fet@@ al meal or fet@@ ching diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli , a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients , the alli , as well as drugs against hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol level , should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ists if the dosage must be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures to prevention in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of the or@@ tal contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on interactions between medicines and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel has been observed . &quot;
&quot; in applying war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies in combination with or@@ list@@ at could be influenced the Quick values ( internationally normal rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentr@@ ations of the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the standardi@@ zation area . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take a suppl@@ em@@ ental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vit@@ amine ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a Ein@@ mal@@ do@@ sis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time Or@@ list@@ at received a low det@@ ach@@ ment of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Animal Experim@@ ental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ al nature and are linked with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption is prevented by taken fat . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ omm@@ ates side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side @-@ effects , which were established after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events have voluntarily reported on a population im@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ si@@ bly that treatment with alli gains in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ omm@@ ates side effects can lead .
&quot; stand@@ off@@ s of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ doses of up to 400 mg three times a day , over a period of 15 days were administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days , without any significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; with the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects are reported in the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies of humans and animals can be attributed to a fast re@@ formation of system@@ ic effects , which are attributed to the li@@ pass@@ able properties of Or@@ list@@ ine . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper lim@@ b intest@@ ine through kov@@ al@@ ente to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of g@@ astr@@ al and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ sions .
&quot; clinical trials has been derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies of adults with a BMI &gt; 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ blast , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in the body weight opposite the output ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight loss ( table 1 ) and as part of those students , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weights ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight @-@ reduction has been observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss in the first 6 months came up . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.9 % ( output value 5.3 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.7 % ( output rating 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output of 3.30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.6 % ( output worth 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; while the wa@@ ist measure was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;
plas@@ ma centr@@ ations of not met@@ abo@@ unding Or@@ list@@ at were 8 hours following the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .

the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
&quot; the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , since the effects of this age group does not have enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , which received chemotherapy or dis@@ sol@@ vers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients were treated with alo@@ xi during the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are , showed 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi during the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , towards 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission acquired Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd. for the establishment of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute sickness and v@@ om@@ iting with strongly em@@ et@@ ogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and for preventing nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting which is in@@ duced by a strongly em@@ et@@ ogenic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .

&quot; however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable for simultaneous use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that may extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which Q@@ t- Inter@@ v@@ all is extended or which tend to be such a pro@@ long@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further Chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi should neither be used to preventing nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;

&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies on the met@@ abolic studies have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in low measure , the I@@ so@@ bi CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the met@@ abolic disorders of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous individual dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine , PAL@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has made approximately 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ ts for healthy was the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients with severe liver dys@@ functions are raised the termin@@ al elim@@ inations and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies effects , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From pre@@ clinical studies , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be involved in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on can@@ als , which are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the promotion of potential . &quot;
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure to people ) who have been given every day over two years , led to a multip@@ lied frequency of Leb@@ ert@@ um@@ oren , thy@@ roid glands and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high do@@ ings of do@@ ings and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results are being low compared to humans . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of hepatitis C approved for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C approved by al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; this means al@@ ph@@ eon of a biological drug named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same quart@@ z @-@ effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference medicine &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for treating adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one by viral infection ) .
&quot; a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination points out the liver tissues damage to , in addition , the values of the liver cycle is Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ norm . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which is associated to the formation of the active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon used data to occupy the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient , composition and purity of the drug , drug , safety and effectiveness of hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared to 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , how many patients were treated after 12 of 48 treatment courses and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood referred to ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , concerns were raised to the stability of the drug and market leadership . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ates the disease in more patients than with the reference manual ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test for exam@@ ining the question of how much the drug uses an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ at@@ roph@@ y skin infection ) and small infected la@@ wl@@ essness ( R@@ iss@@ or or cutting ) , cur@@ ves and paraly@@ zed wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , veri@@ fiable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ able resist@@ ent st@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infection may not affect this kind of infection . &quot;
&quot; ag@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial cast@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was lo@@ wered after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients suffer from plac@@ ebo languages to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected bro@@ unds , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ exin similar contact : if the results of both studies were gathered in Hau@@ tw@@ ins , talked about 90 % of the patients of both groups on treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( the crowded H@@ ohl@@ habitats in the body tissue ) or by infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go can out@@ weigh the risks of Al@@ tar@@ go , following the following super@@ ficial skin infections towards the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • un@@ inhi@@ bited small in@@ serts , sh@@ ed@@ ding , or se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission acquired the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd .. a permit for the use of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union . &quot;
patients who showed no improvement within two to three days should be investigated once again and consider an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of an awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation through the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be the treatment has been interrupted , the ano@@ int should be carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection can be started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies at secondary infected wound , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resist@@ ent st@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient . &quot;
&quot; an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or a deterioration of the infected body occurs . &quot;
the impact of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ ma @-@ concentr@@ ations , which were reached in humans according to top@@ ical use on secluded skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous engine of 2 @-@ mal daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ical application from 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be on secluded skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not required to be required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in during a system@@ ic treatment is applied with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a prec@@ productive in@@ toxic@@ ity after oral in@@ ges@@ tion and are inadequate in relation to any statement on the birth and the rolls / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when an top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go will be termin@@ ated , is between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most frequently reported c@@ eption of irrit@@ ation on the administration , which consider approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; drug ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of Pl@@ euro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eric anus ( formerly Pl@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eric anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the drug mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a certain bond of bacterial , inter@@ locking of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ier@@ ender anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data point out that the binary post @-@ Bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binary place and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ Centre .
&quot; due to the bond of this bond , Pl@@ euro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub @-@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be based on the basis of the local prevalence of Resi@@ st@@ ine the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in at least some infection forms , a consultation should be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether insul@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) will be considered . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was brought 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and sw@@ elled skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary schools , individual plas@@ m@@ apro@@ x were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was carried out on the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual system@@ ic recording of people after top@@ ical use of 1 % Sal@@ be to 200 m ² ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP pen .

&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) that were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix will protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) among children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not imm@@ un against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used within the framework of a two doses existing vacc@@ ination , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if during the immun@@ isation there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the existing database plan can be brought into an end from two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired can be Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis A@@ - or B vaccine .
&quot; vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ enses of the body ) , &quot; as it can be against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface @-@ surface anti @-@ anti@@ gens and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as that of 1996 @-@ approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix kids .
the three vaccines have been applied to protect the same diseases but are administ@@ ered Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children under one of three doses existing vaccines .
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults identified ingredients , some of the data that are based on the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the final injection of an protective anti@@ body .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine has been compared with a h@@ exag@@ onal and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix took a month between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the final injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had similar to six@@ teen and at a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , appeti@@ tes , pain , sor@@ eness , redness , mat@@ eness , ti@@ redness and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used to patients who may not be excessive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) should not be applied . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the in@@ feed of Ambi@@ rix throughout the world
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ arization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ chim@@ ney is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ated vaccines or a combination of a combination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ hepatitis C anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ated vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet completely secured , whether immun@@ o @-@ competent persons , which have addressed to a hepatitis B vaccine as protection , as they may well be protected with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies may be protected by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all inj@@ ecting nutritional supplements should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended , the 360 ELISA @-@ units formal hepatitis B @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis and persons with disorders of the immune system is achieved after the pri@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation under certain circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ h@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body , so in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required . &quot;
since an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to an subtle impact that these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
&quot; in case of Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ ia or hem@@ or@@ ical disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be in@@ ject sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in those cases after in@@ tra @-@ muscular gift . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix had been administ@@ ered in the second life of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- and ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us enh@@ enz@@ ae Type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mask vaccine . the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective need , that there may be no sufficient immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , which was conducted with 3 in@@ dem@@ ons of these wor@@ ding in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ic , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ atives @-@ containing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 2029 vacc@@ d@@ ants Ambi@@ rix were administ@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inate at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix had been compared with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant @-@ combin@@ ant . &quot;
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and sailors on a basis basis per vaccine do@@ sis ambi@@ rix but not on a basis basis per person .
&quot; pain has been observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the promot@@ ers , compared to 39,@@ 1 % in accordance with the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant . &quot;

&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 were the default combin@@ ant with three doses . &quot;
&quot; with the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 dos@@ en@@ cyclop@@ ae@@ dia significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical trial study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after ending the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
&quot; for individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation of Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine . &quot;

&quot; the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water @-@ contaminated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a blu@@ ish face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lo@@ in ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all the vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is infected with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or hepatitis B @-@ Virus ( although you are not likely to feel uncomfortable or ill with hepatitis B ) ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick ) any vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disorder .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those according to a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• if your child already has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can express themselves through ju@@ ck@@ r@@ ots , air@@ borne or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have already performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a serious infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within six months and in front of the aforementioned administration of the second vaccines ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will charge you / your child from an imp@@ eller with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content on efficient components per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepatitis A @-@ Virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content on efficient components is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine protection from ending the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from heavy blood@@ shed , under the skin and not in the muscle blo@@ ws . • If you are weak@@ ened / your child because of a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s body &apos;s body / or if you / your child is under@@ min@@ ted from a hem@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
&quot; 21 Be your doctor , if you want to take your child further medicines ( including those that you have received no prescription ) or if you have received / your child recently vacc@@ inated , or if you have administ@@ ered or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has been planned , or that is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate offices and as different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually Ambi@@ rix Schw@@ ang@@ eren or nursing women is not administ@@ ered , except it is urgent to vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data that has become known for issu@@ ing the first approval for the in@@ toxic@@ ation , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix had been positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix had only been transported in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient &apos;s exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete end @-@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ mix@@ op@@ athy ( brain injury as a result of high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ id@@ ations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - divided into several retailers to meals - sw@@ allowed , mixed up by food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach leading hose ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with a different treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ ache medicine , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , hydr@@ ation , hydr@@ ation , hydr@@ ation , failure , failure , failure , skin rash , in@@ pleas@@ ing body , or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) termin@@ ated to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle is effectively prevented in high am@@ moni@@ aneous values .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , since due to the rar@@ ity of the illness at the time of approval was limited only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indic@@ ted in all patients , with which a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ tle has already manifest@@ ed in the newborn age ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fixed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective ) , there is an indication for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , there is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial en@@ cep@@ hal@@ op@@ athy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children , who are not able to sw@@ allow tablets or for patients with sl@@ ing disorders AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
&quot; daily dose is individually calculated with regard to protein toler@@ ance , and the development and development necessary in the daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of 20 kg and in @-@ growing and adults . &quot;
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ der@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ am@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day necessary .
patients with an argin@@ ine @-@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency do not need Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered patients with sl@@ ing disorders as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ soph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a is when the tablets do not get immediately in the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium in accordance with 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium pro 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with the embro@@ i@@ tive heart disease or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with sodium and eco @-@ based clinical conditions only with caution .
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium int@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ates via the liver and the kid@@ neys , should be applied to patients with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency , only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ an &apos;s gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of ne@@ ural gener@@ alization and a increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also found a del@@ ayed irrit@@ ation of cereb@@ ral synchron@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be determined if Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ iled by humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and for that reason is the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS came at 56 % of patients at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
&quot; incidence is defined as follows : very frequently ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was developed by a 18 year old anor@@ tic patient , who developed a met@@ abolic path@@ ology in connection with Lak@@ tat@@ toos , he@@ y@@ top@@ ia , periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a case of over@@ dose , occurred at a 5 month old small child with an acci@@ d dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed in intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day an dos@@ is@@ hable neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection that is lab@@ elled through acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ odi@@ zed that is left over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ odi@@ zed is comparable to urea ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ odi@@ zed is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of excess embro@@ ider@@ y . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle may be assumed that for each gram you are produced Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ odi@@ zed nit@@ rogen .
it is crucial that the diagnosis is being placed at an early stage and treatment will immediately start to improve survival opportunities and the clinical result .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ fold form of the condition with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always inf@@ eri@@ or , and the disease itself was used for treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ le @-@ free analog@@ y within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; due to hem@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen oxi@@ fication ( sodium diet , sodium and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new @-@ born diseases to 80 % within the first life of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ word hal@@ op@@ athy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients there came with the time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ pulation form of the disease ( including feminine patients with the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous transc@@ end@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate and a prot@@ ectable diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible and in some patients may occur another deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ idi@@ zed in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine conden@@ sing , being phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ odi@@ zed . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in Plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis according to individual treatment as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic rate was also examined in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous gases of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; according to an or@@ al single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after in@@ ges@@ measurable plas@@ ma centr@@ ations were established by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cir@@ cli@@ ties or hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , according to various doses Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after ni@@ cious fasting , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at Plas@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three retail ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is carried out within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gi@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no kl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( inf@@ ants and children , who can sw@@ allow any tablets , or patients with s@@ laughter disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ é or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborn weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of 20 kg as well as in @-@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , argin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ ni@@ tin and ser@@ um proteins in Plas@@ ma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ der@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ am@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day necessary .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium pro gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium pro 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ d@@ utes were suspended before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain @-@ cows .
&quot; a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was developed by a 18 year old anor@@ tic patient , who developed a met@@ abolic path@@ ology in connection with Lak@@ tat@@ toos , he@@ y@@ top@@ ia , periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ odi@@ zed is comparable to urea ( both compounds included 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ odi@@ zed is therefore suitable as alternative support for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess use . &quot;
on the basis of investigations on the exp@@ ul@@ sion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for each gram you are produced Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ odi@@ zed nit@@ rogen .
existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur another deterioration of the neurological condition .
after an or@@ al single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after in@@ ges@@ measurable plas@@ ma centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can retain the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measurement of measurement is 0.95 g , the medium measuring l@@ ons 2,@@ 9 g and the large measurement of 8,@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the drug via a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dis@@ solved in water ( sol@@ ility of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver cycle are missing , so that they can accum@@ ulate the embro@@ ider@@ y waste products that may collect from proteins in the body after consuming proteins . &quot;
&quot; if you have conducted laboratory tests , you must inform the doctor that you may take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS because Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; while taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for treating adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ es ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ er &quot; ( coron@@ ary measuring value in the electro@@ cardi@@ og@@ ram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
will An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ auses in patients living on a PCI will be administ@@ ered a higher dose and inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow towards the maintenance of blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all over the grid / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ auses ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;

the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s funds ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that An@@ gi@@ ox is acceptable in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable substitute for Hep@@ her .
September 2004 the European Commission of the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd held a permit for det@@ ox inj@@ ections in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever in@@ far@@ ts ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with an emergency grip or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ tion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is conducted in another episode , an additional bolt of 0,5 mg / kg should be given and inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention on 1,75 mg / kg / h will be increased . &quot;
&quot; after PCI can be taken after clinical requirements , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a pin of 0,5 mg / kg is administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ o@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ als of intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ tion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly subsequent inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a every pin gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ tion should be made of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitute and dil@@ uted medicines should be measured against the application carefully and the Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis can be rapidly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administ@@ ered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function , ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that are treated with a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the ACT value is under 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg and test the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate he@@ avier kidney cancer , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which resulted in approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the Gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion at average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney cancer ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients is an@@ gi@@ ox contr@@ ain@@ dicated ( see below section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be 30 minutes after completion of intraven@@ ous hep@@ atic Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termin@@ ation of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of low molecular Hep@@ her .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or higher blood risk . • severe un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and / or mis@@ sive disorder ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if used in PCI patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding on arter@@ ial points , can be under@@ gone in patients who under@@ go to an per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while treating in principle all ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking hold of war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ value ( International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in once again achieved before the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the substance mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ oly@@ tica or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ag@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the blood of blood . &quot;
the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ lic ag@@ ony or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in any case regularly control .
&quot; the experimental investigations have been in terms of impact on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the removal or post @-@ nat@@ ali@@ ale development ( see below section 5.3 ) . &quot;

the following information about side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to 6000 patients who under@@ go PCI .
&quot; both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the treated with Hep@@ arin , it came to women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently unwanted events than in male or younger patients . &quot;

&quot; the following side @-@ effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ad is to break down immediately and to monitor the patient eng@@ ma@@ y with regard to signs of a ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ atic inhibit@@ or , which is both on the cataly@@ tic centre as well as the anim@@ al@@ bin@@ ds region of Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is tied in the liquid phase or by Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn divi@@ des the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ pro@@ 4 , making the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;
&quot; in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with ser@@ um of patients , in which it has come to hep@@ ar@@ in@@ duced Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ ie / hep@@ ar@@ in@@ duced Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , does not indu@@ ce Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes Ag@@ greg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in shows Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in an dos@@ is@@ - and con@@ centr@@ alised @-@ dependent nuclear effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if the patient has been carried out a PCI , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be increased and inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y study was administ@@ ered Un@@ fr@@ act@@ i@@ fied Hep@@ her or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ theid in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of ak@@ ut@@ em fic@@ ina syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ wives ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) administ@@ ered .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that need treatment with insul@@ in . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ ted ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ en , the thig@@ h or the over@@ arm in@@ ject or as a dis@@ inf@@ usion administ@@ ered with a insul@@ in pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insul@@ in to the regulation of gl@@ uc@@ ose dolph@@ ins ( sugar ) in blood or that insul@@ in is not effectively processed .
insul@@ in l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs greatly in human insul@@ in and the change means that it affects faster and a shorter active time has than a short @-@ effective human@@ insul@@ in .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in the application in combination with a slower insul@@ in in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body can produce no insul@@ in in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and a study with 5@@ 72 children between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type @-@ 2 diabetes , when the body of insul@@ in cannot be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed ha@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.7 % ( 7.3 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to reducing 0.05 % in insul@@ in l@@ is@@ per . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration were reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration in percent after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % in human normal @-@ insul@@ in . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood@@ stream levels .
September 2004 the European Commission of San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH shared a permit for the in@@ feed of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the stomach blank@@ et that apply Ober@@ sch@@ enk@@ els or Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the field of abdom@@ inal thickness .
&quot; due to the decreased gl@@ uc@@ ose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insul@@ in delivery , the insul@@ in need to be dis@@ solved in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the drug , the brand ( her@@ e- manufacturers ) , the insul@@ in ( normal , N@@ PH , v@@ ani@@ zed delay etc . ) , the type of insul@@ in ( animal insul@@ in ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insul@@ in needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or the break@@ up of a treatment , in particular in patients with a insul@@ in @-@ based diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic c@@ eto@@ wer ; these conditions are potential life @-@ threatening . &quot;
&quot; switching to a patient to another insul@@ in type or insul@@ in another producer , should be done under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required . &quot;
the time of escal@@ ation of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the substance profile of insul@@ in and can therefore change from switching to treatment .
&quot; to the substances that can increase ble@@ eding activity and increase the incl@@ ination to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics , anti @-@ oxid@@ ants , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine Ox@@ id@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Pent@@ ox@@ et@@ yll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of symptom cells such as sc@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ dine , Guan@@ ony , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves the symptoms of the ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ag@@ ic regulation will be de@@ ported or are missing . &quot;
&quot; animal Experim@@ ental studies on reproductive medicine showed no differences between the in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human @-@ insul@@ in in terms of pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insul@@ ating l@@ ul@@ is@@ in into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general occurs insul@@ in either into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated according to oral use . &quot;

severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics with consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be treated by an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of gl@@ uc@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by a prescribed person or by intraven@@ ous gases of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
&quot; after a gl@@ uc@@ t@@ onal object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insul@@ in lo@@ wers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( in particular through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
