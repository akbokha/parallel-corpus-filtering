<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably acts mainly as a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripid zol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in slightly lower dimensions than the neurotransmitter acts to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine can play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, contributing to normpivzol to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and may be prevented re-occurring."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of furniture, the re-emergence of the symptoms, has been studied in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar diseases resulting in increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>

<seg id="25">The Committee on Humanpharma's funds (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of schizophrenia in the treatment of schizophrenia and from intermediate to severe manic episodes in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes have outweigh the risks with Aripivzol to the risks.</seg>
