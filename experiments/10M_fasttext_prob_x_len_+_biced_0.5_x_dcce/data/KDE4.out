package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
&quot; for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &quot;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings .... Open the card @-@ card tools and choose the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list with standard delivery modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on Extr@@ as@@ par@@ as ; then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete . &quot;
&quot; this module is called &quot; &quot; folder filter &quot; &quot; ) you can reach in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extracts filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s updated working directory to different kinds of filters . &quot;
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extr@@ as DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the straight @-@ displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root marks of the document , example : document@@ ations , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root cl@@ ash . &quot;
the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; another view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text views so as to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the feature of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in a sp@@ elling folder with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or an folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , great files , even then easily be detected , when a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; F@@ S@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ am @-@ Display is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for easy navigation , the right @-@ fit navigation possess a meaningful color control and mod@@ est@@ ant settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which can be switched on color mode , can either be depth for the slight detection of the dis@@ car@@ ef@@ ile or the illustration of another file name such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME @-@ type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is currently displayed at all , only when sufficient space to display is present or if the surface of sub@@ ordinate law occur ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with Dar@@ ing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ aties in &amp; F@@ S@@ View , this goal is not always kept . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; as a division of the surface of a contract for the sub@@ ordinate entries is done , the implementation remains to be left . here , it is necessary for the restricted and avoiding of space losses by setting the most square . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
you can set the minimal b@@ yp@@ ted area for an entry over the menu item opinion . instead a smoking pattern is drawn into the area of the higher level of application to indicate that this area is actually covered by an sub@@ ordinate entry .
originally &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map A@@ wid@@ gets designed to be developed for application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .

&quot; digi@@ tization came ; includes a quick image processing with base editing tools . you can use these to evaluate and correct your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . the editing capacity can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ tization came ; easy to use , it is du@@ ci@@ ve professional skills available . it works fully in the 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw conver@@ gence using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC @-@ colour controls , work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
&quot; as all &amp; k@@ de ; programs also came &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it is on the support of the En@@ dan@@ wen@@ der . they should therefore find problems and suggestions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous came ; tries to report the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu contains an associated problems or wishes .... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined system . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to send your account . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means , we would like to answer other users of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation , then we would like to answer other users of other users . however , in this mailing list , we would like to answer any further questions from other users . however , in this mailing list , you should therefore be mighty in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage to visit news of released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; the best start to get off and to participate , is the registration in the developer mailing list . guide to sign up in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization ; &quot;
&quot; when you come &amp; digi@@ ous ; for the first time , you are asked where you want to store your images and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a folder name or click on the folder symbol folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data backup will be saved . this path remains the same for all the images . &quot;
later you can add as many folder as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will you also use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings digi@@ ach set up collections
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can indicate the top folder , the pictures contains , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ tization ; consider each sub@@ folder as an album . no photo will be changed . during the search of the folder you get an advanced display like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous came ; dur@@ a recur@@ sively close the libr@@ arian in its entire depth . you can not lock the sub@@ folder , unless it &apos;s i@@ ste into hiding folder . this can you make an extraordinary folder , complete by adding a point before the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not take photos as symbols . you can change it by using a popular photo from the album and this will then be used as an album symbol . more details on this can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have con@@ figured the base folder , you can set up into &amp; digi@@ ous ; your digital camera will set up . afterwards , you should learn how you use My albums and My sampling , to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw material support : in case you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can also handle . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w @-@ library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , so you can find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ kam@@ a@@ supported . &quot;
how to set this up and work with raw files in the sections of Ro@@ w Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; an easy to use camera interfaces will be provided , so that you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tization ; of course , every medium and every deck @-@ les@@ er , which is supported by your operating system , with a digi@@ tization . &quot;
modern digital cameras are specified by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the connection can also be realized as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may be used under certain conditions to connect the smart port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of pictures of digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are de@@ prec@@ ated , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found here . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be read with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the current support is available from some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 @-@ camera users , you may not be able to un@@ read the view@@ points or the production could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ ous came ; is how easy its functionality can extend through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ ous ; , K@@ photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s essentially easier to supplement &amp; digi@@ tization ; through writing a small module to supplement a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ tization ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side @-@ page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Um@@ sch@@ alt + F . &quot;
&quot; the drag and drop of images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree trunk , above the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not in sampling , file list or searches . &quot;
&quot; - a fil@@ ary selection allows you to lift the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields used in the tool@@ view . thus , the filter@@ ing on the fil@@ en@@ ames is displayed only when this ind , symbol@@ ism is displayed , which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; constitutes an organized view on your photo . all photos that were saved by &amp; digi@@ tization . these albums are saved according to the folder in which it was created on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the properties tab or after the date , on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to one album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can drop the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it down . you can click on the same way to move through moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it on the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to access information about this collection . to access the album properties , click on the album and select the context menu album properties . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your records , so that you can choose from a single name . if you choose collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums by collection . if you want to add new collections or edit them , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um Date : is used if you sort your albums on date with View albums by sort of date sort .
&quot; the buttons el@@ der , average , new nests : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the new image , or the average of the album . first , first tries to calculate the average of images out of their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead , the date of the last change of each file used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first came to a new album , the first image in the album was chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this will help you to remember the pictures in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click on the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album pre@@ fix . additionally , you can draw the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be scr@@ apped .
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; supports the input of sampling for individual photos in the section My sampling list left below in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;

&quot; once you open an album the first time , you will be briefly waiting while the view@@ points will be generated . this can avoid you , in which you can create new features in the Extr@@ as Show items . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed beneath the P@@ review P@@ review . what information these are , you can change over settings ; select the albums page and adjust the area designs to suit your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the view@@ points have assist@@ ants . if you rest the mouse @-@ po@@ inter for a moment about a picture , the help shows the main features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the section introduction into the main window shows such an assistant ster . &quot;
&quot; photos are all that comes to &amp; digi@@ tization . albums and tags allow you to organise your photos as it suits you . you can reach all functions that come with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can easily reach the context menu of the viewing menu or menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between the viewing of images , a sli@@ deshow or editing the pictures . &quot;

this rider provides an intuitive pattern tools available based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ Program . you can capture and move the mouse button . drag the pictures within this coordinates . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this will keep your pictures ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filters . this will then be added for later use of the list below . he works like a live Geo@@ ord@@ ner .
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; constitutes a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported picture formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em ligh@@ tically added from the context menu . if you are back on &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window are , you can open the lumin@@ ous quickly with L extras . &quot;
&quot; from the view bar , you can draw the pictures that you compare to see in the left or right area of the window and drop it there . if you preview synchroni@@ ze from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or shooting operations on one of the pictures , then these can be compared with the other picture . so you can compare the same area of both images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to convert quickly from a picture series . if you are using pa@@ edi@@ tions from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the areas of the same . the right adjacent picture is displayed in the right section . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions work directly from the illumin@@ ant such as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both pros and vis@@ ually available in the light . this makes for example simple visual differences with lay@@ ering data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see in the crossed path . to keep the visible area of the picture , you need to click those anch@@ ored and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode , then both images will be shown in the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom controller among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to get into the picture and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are sne@@ ak in the mode P@@ review .
&quot; what is a digital component @-@ wal@@ nut - away from the fashion word ? digital components , following the picture has been taken up until the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or digital photos records a form of digital components . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , we will use the downloading , backup , secure , secure , secure , optimize , waiting , waiting and export images . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale components is target@@ ing , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , transform@@ ing , con@@ figured and exported content that have a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined in accordance with your definition data that will provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim when you can find out more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use not to know how many photos you have , then use not too fast addi@@ ction and a safe archiving to you with other programs , platforms and formats free . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and know before you have to incorporate anything into your system , the structure of information structure as opposed to the data structure . you have to decide whether other access to your photos or if you want to save it on a reserved drive or at a network @-@ network &amp; etc . notice that you will sometimes have to change on a larger drive . &quot;
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found in one year several times in the same place . if you have enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements like version@@ ing of photos , archiving , constant access from pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % of work files will not be re@@ organising . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the p@@ ile processing simpler . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the setup page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization ; it is sure that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file , then you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what to change ? to make them a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should now select every photo key@@ word , coating and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start best with the rating or the leaderboard . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s now let &apos;s proceed with key@@ note , keywords , as you are frequently called for other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alog@@ ised pictures from another source with embedded notes , then it will automatically fit the tree for you b@@ z@@ w the pictures to the right place . the changing keywords will be done on another . the modified keywords will be updated by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while the sub @-@ trees are persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very crude representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are characteristics of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to accus@@ ations or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ze your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want most anyone who just want to let your photos just see , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this the main square of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , memories , the historical time period is again present , you may possibly even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at the titles is possibly more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help the viewer to help Him about the motif that you moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect when it has the strength to act only with a cap@@ tion for himself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can export as much text , export in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE provide you with a sp@@ elling examination . you have to tell it for a selection of images in the label and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery . you don &apos;t have to tell the story for the opening ceremony no second time . &quot;
remember the times prior to GPS ? when you had to find in a different city without navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? well because with images the train of the spatial presentation will now move with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation can already be unt@@ rou@@ bled and will open up in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travels through images with geographical indications . you can then export the photos at the reception area . you can also export the photos at the reception area . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps spect@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information on the establishment page of &amp; digi@@ tization ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for author and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it does not want to be saved the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization has been saved , it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as divi@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for fibre line ) : associated with the author . examples of examples can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independence photographer . since this is a note to the car box , it must be filled out . &quot;
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who is the photo . this does not necessarily mean the author . if the photographer does not necessarily have the author . if the photo is listed here that you can see the picture here . if the image is a stock below , the image file is provided here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections . anyone who has no protection against abuse . anyone who has no protection against abuse . anyone who has no protection against abuse . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important against them . &quot;
the digital water@@ marks is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will be available for such a module in the near future .
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , turn@@ out , black@@ out , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , durability , temperature , temperature size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or fire . this type of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative effects . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data controller in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be treated more difficult and one may not last longer than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that is in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ cs and good conditions . the best DVD capture are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . so it &apos;s about to select the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you just have just been written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and control . despite this massive protection they are needed for chemical aging , ultr@@ avi@@ olet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , which seems to have a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster . it works under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications of damaged dis@@ rupted dis@@ ks , hard@@ disk , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray dis@@ ks seem to save the For@@ mas war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs was also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording meg@@ ali@@ ght on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . also tick the media with a description , date &amp; author labels and after@@ ward in a clean , dark dry and spot @-@ protected spot . do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disco@@ s retain your statistics for yourself . your manufacturer erg@@ ar@@ ants cover a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study via the error mechanisms of hard@@ disk : dis@@ track study . &quot;
&quot; soon : Dis@@ ks hold on the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ament area of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . electronic parts of Controll@@ ers are the com@@ mon@@ est fault of error , S@@ MAR@@ T can not notice this error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T fixed error messages will not occur within 4 to 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is just the complete ver@@ ste due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electricity before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices electricity does not make a lot , it looks different from devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed cables . these can cause serious harm . on your computer you can cause severe damage , hardware replacement , non @-@ destructive mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect yourself in front of the un@@ avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against electricity head is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy heat absorbed and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . however , remember that not every plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect the protection against light@@ ning bolt and therefore protect the correct equipment . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should pay attention to all the periph@@ er@@ als that are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage ratings for your mo@@ dem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of the cable Mode@@ ms and the television map . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore they also contain protection for mo@@ dem . thus , you are ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system will protect against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you loss of unwanted data . even an expression of a few seconds may cause loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a inter@@ rup@@ tive power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ tension , these devices can automatically exp@@ ire Battery energy when a black@@ out occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and proceed to the system . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting . &quot;
concern you are exposed to the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare your safety in electrical disturb@@ ances with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you &apos;re thinking about how well your computer is protected . at the end you should always remember all the cable before moving into the holidays .
&quot; the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive on &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantities of data . &quot;
&quot; they are compared to the hard@@ disk , but very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos and you will not get your images in full resolution online . the professional version provides you with more information , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be just checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically transfer@@ ed thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the big companies in the offer a backup and a shared memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that you no man says when a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . no one seems to have been destroyed in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power components are another source of transmission loss , since they generate intervals within the data flow . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transmission issues , you should look into the future . already 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with record errors , and is available under one of the GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms which are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the core .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss during the not@@ ebook and 46 % of job systems . at not@@ ebooks amounts to the proportion of theft .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the most common . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new install@@ ationen . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal than ext@@ 3 , travel F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the broad@@ cast@@ ed file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an arbitr@@ ary status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 bl@@ ending settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and space character@@ iz@@ es for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el sens@@ ations . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and a high @-@ quality optics , the optimum size for comp@@ ak@@ t@@ kam@@ eras . even DSLR cameras have a full format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro , so do not make anyone other for data loss . so do not secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous as the rein@@ stall of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the sizes of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your sight@@ ings on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a light@@ ning suggests you are lucky when the drive in the moment was not connected . &quot;
&quot; a disaster defe@@ ats locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air @-@ glasses : fire , water , electricity , children and rob@@ bers are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs to the neighboring building , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
full backup : a complete backup of all files secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
&quot; difference security : a backup of the files have been changed since the last bur@@ ial insurance , generates a complete snap@@ shot up to two time points : that of the complete assurance and the last actu@@ aries . &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time at any time . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system next to the exception that it is only canc@@ eled and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machine . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer tran@@ scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security about ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to DVD or another visual medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for every month . every further evaluation should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original reserve , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ treats pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; with this valuable images the next 40 year survive , that is about the period in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you must look at all what is said today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to be compatible with caution . however , the less variants you have used in the past , the more easily to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered on the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is currently available for everyone . so if you have an old system that &apos;s important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and f@@ use technology , or your file format , you should convert your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always bigger .
&quot; let &apos;s proceed from that you have planned the scal@@ ability , and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
http : / / dev / s@@ db / s@@ dc / s@@ db / s@@ dc / s@@ db / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ dc / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software anymore you can read it . this task will become easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a propriet@@ ory that disappears slowly from the market . you should therefore no longer use it .
&quot; P@@ NG was replaced as an open source standard , it can replace X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Metad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can use Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chrom@@ ebook information . this format would be recommended to store your images to save your images . &quot;
&quot; T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a format format . T@@ IF@@ F can be saved in un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a lu@@ st@@ ree free com@@ pression mode . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The digital neg@@ atives format is a licence @-@ free and open model format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed because of the need to use met@@ ad@@ ata . it is based on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will eventually use it sometime .
&quot; this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology has been introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a blend of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored the XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it before an original of your shot , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP therefore fits the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata to achieve a wide range of applications and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educ@@ ative efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card@@ holder or the scanner . so long the pictures on the Cam@@ ame@@ dium are , you can use it as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a multi @-@ lay@@ ered process , you can use external programs again . if you want to edit the pictures again with a digi@@ tization ; then you should add met@@ ad@@ ata again . these have been cut down by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them in web galleries , use them in contact , print &amp; etc &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ . in the section &quot; Add a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you have photos on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import pictures to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and switch it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , try to connect with your camera . when the connection is made , a pig@@ let indicator appears at the bottom and the view@@ points of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for file order is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information about each entry . with the page features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera . one symbol shows that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras , not all information is available . &quot;
&quot; the rider Metad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as P@@ 50@@ s , manufacturer noticeable , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata @-@ side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the photos from her camera to a single album . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were sure to delete photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos directly , you can select only the desired with the default templates methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button to download and then download selected . the button check out is long as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option is new to download . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ . in this case the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in advance . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons all download or download selected , appears a dialogue with which you can select the target album , displayed in the list of existing albums . select the list of existing albums you can read in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and push OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tization ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the button delete all . if you just want to delete it , you need to delete them first and delete it . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no way of getting photos you deleted from the camera ; they should not be checked carefully before you delete it from the camera ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should have this over the camera menu , since this is much faster . &quot;
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently no particularly expres@@ sive names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually deleted once you load photos of different insights into the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and spi@@ kes of the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ related subjects . if you use this latter option , automatically a folder is created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options , which are performed before the photos on the record are stored . the first two concern the information about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can fix date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
if you want a different file format than the default format you can e.g. add the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . place the option date &amp; time to read .
&quot; if you use the option camera file , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower case letters . or if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ous came ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are stored and automatically used if you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization : can use all the information about the orientation of camera to time recording . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic spin is usually switched and if your camera does not delivers this information , lets &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photo in the original orientation . if you turn off the automatic spin @-@ up and choose the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera has made information about the date , where the photo was made available , this sub@@ directories are based on the photo album . not all cameras will be loaded onto the same date . not all cameras will be available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read , which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button @-@ based bom@@ bs at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way photos from your computer to load their camera is the button download . select then upload . the file dial dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files you should be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the selection of the selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; you where the images are loaded high . a folder dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position to be shown in long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ atitude , which can be displayed on a map . identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link a picture with an accurate geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphic an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; users who want to loc@@ alize the location of the photos , or simply want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to play the positioning data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ clude many GPS data fields , such as direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and Map@@ refer@@ enzen . the question is actually more , just like the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be saved with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from pictures and the GPS . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ signed coordinates , which can be created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ googl@@ e.com does not show European maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which will show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous came ; try to give you so much control over his work@@ flows like possible . in order to access this settings , you need to select in the menu settings . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; to select action can be displayed on built @-@ in type or picture editing , so that the default behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tization came ; if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected when downloading the camera interfaces . also , with a database synchroni@@ zation , these data are recorded in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author@@ title is a syn@@ onym for fibre line : this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer . this can be design@@ ations like e.g. an employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer , or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description to the car box , this is also to be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to enter the photo . this does not need to be the author , as such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . it is achieved that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanent in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization ; they will be imported without lost .
&quot; cap@@ tions as built @-@ in co@@ atings ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG pictures : this syn@@ ced the comments you can add to your photos , with images embedded in pictures . thus , your co@@ atings can also be read by other imag@@ inations , these are already sign@@ posted by the images , these are over@@ written by the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information they appear , when the mouse @-@ po@@ inter in the main window above a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supports a number of different picture formats and some video formats . to specify which file @-@ types &amp; digi@@ tization came ; display , you can add the file extension of this list and remove . each file in a &amp; digi@@ tization ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner that none of these extensions did not come ; ignored . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Ref@@ res@@ h right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the illumin@@ ant of &amp; digi@@ tization ; can then be set on this page . however , some pictures then have different sizes and the syn@@ chron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , the option &amp; quot ; in the whole image size Lad@@ der . if you have one , then you can achieve better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can switch this here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the imaging mode in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; Over@@ - and under@@ ed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or h@@ ellers color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in image processing , this screen can be switched mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer declaration .
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG com@@ pression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since P@@ NG used a ver@@ lu@@ st@@ ree algorith@@ m . the only effect is that the picture is needed more time to output and pack . if you have a quick machine , you can attach this value to a high com@@ pression . thereby , 1 : low and 9 has a high com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; with the option T@@ IF@@ F files , you can switch to the Def@@ late -@@ com@@ pression mode . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality , as the Def@@ late @-@ algorith@@ m distor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with the adjustment of loss of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can freely save the loss of loss of JP@@ EG . even if you have written the ver@@ sible adjustment , the relationship between quality loss and fil@@ esi@@ ze was far better than with normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata were not yet supported , but was still in the planning . &quot;
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization ; the image processing only a picture look for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
&quot; the default conversion is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option features the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 fl@@ atter@@ ing with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white balance is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting will only be used if the white balance is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , photographed on a white map which has been photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this option is supported only for fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ load images in four steps more details in the top light . for other cameras , this option is ignored . &quot;
&quot; the standard is it the top light , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top light , as it shows the top light in various ros@@ es . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top light . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ous came ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red pieces from the has@@ n &apos;t saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter how much colour or wh@@ ites you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option to construct a level , you get the option to put a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ worth to your taste . you may have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; but this can also be held later in the image options of the &amp; D ; they should advance conservative .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sharing image sensor that have many cameras and is known as a matrix color@@ less pixel . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives available : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . but after some tests it was used as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was created . however , it generates dy@@ art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting when you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour vari@@ ance of your lenses , you can put the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since you are carried out during the pipe conver@@ tion . &quot;
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information like the color information of a color foam in the others are thus able to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
behavior ask if a picture is open in image processing / colour management module with raw files .
&quot; color profile folder , insert here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tization ; exam@@ ines this folder during the start . &quot;
settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to store your profiles . everything can be changed while opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colorful not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturer and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have a colour mapping or Gam@@ mak@@ or@@ oplast@@ . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not required for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the colour sound mapping . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from one device , as your printer can have a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be performed very saturated , instead of leaving yourself on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is pretty obvious that colour profile is intended for them for what is intended . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles together . this answer is of course in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; Canon profiles expanded the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; images consider , by delivering this interface &amp; digi@@ tization ; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select which you want to use , and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ tization . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context @-@ menu of the pros . &quot;
&quot; commands for tasks , which are carried out by modules , can be set in the menu under settings shor@@ ts . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ hed the time between the images , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other crosses fields turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata or out , which appears at the lower end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features are shown on the left a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer , make sure that the camera is connected correctly , switched and in the image mode . below are the port@@ settings . currently , here are Seri@@ o , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the lower end you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / remo@@ vable , where you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer , turn it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; digi@@ tization ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera amo@@ del and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the M@@ ül@@ h@@ mer , you can view the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tization ; while delet@@ ing a photo in an album . in sections del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and delet@@ ing an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ tization ; apply , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without queries . otherwise , you will need to apply changes to the button below . &quot;
you can also tie the display of the Welcome @-@ screen of &amp; digi@@ tization ; this will be accelerated under certain circumstances the start @-@ start of &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; the setting for Bei@@ m starts searching for new photos , which came to look for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start @-@ time of &amp; digi@@ tised . if something comes from the base folder , asks , if something comes to delete them from the base . &quot;
&quot; different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised , to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can select under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below : &quot;
these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; you will find more information about this tutorial .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization came ; includes a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to look at your photos and to correct and improve . image processing may be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture , or through the context menu of the announcement and selection of the manual / editing . &quot;
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization ; they are thus not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in paragraph photo processing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , enlargement factor and the current image size shows . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar on the upper edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you use File Save or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo if you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file Save .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the button file re @-@ establish or the kno@@ b button to produce re @-@ produce in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change that you have carried out on the photo since the last time . &quot;
almost every action of the image processing can be und@@ res@@ sed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting mach@@ ining and restored by selecting mach@@ ining from the menu .
&quot; when you are using this frequently , you should make yourself the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for return and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to be recovered . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the reverse or re @-@ establish kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar a moment longer press , get a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also rever@@ b or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image r@@ enter or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can get in the photo and out of zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar , or the entries in the App@@ ly menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically select &quot;
&quot; view of full screen mode shows the photo in the full screen mode . normally you come into the normal view , where you want to use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can view this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ . this can call you out of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; see this section on the setup of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the picture picture below and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can select individual images or whole propositions . whole image lines can select from your selection . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album , select your choice , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; this window comes ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation bar , even in the picture editing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multi@@ f@@ aches clicking on the same rider can appear the side bar or disappear in the edge .
&quot; in the prot@@ ru@@ ding view , you can enter cap@@ tions with unlimited size or insert . note the remark below . the text is allowed UT@@ F @-@ 8 . this means that all special characters are allowed into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all the comments are cut after 2000 characters and are shaped by special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC lock@@ ers in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; once you have commented on , use either the button @-@ button or simply change the next image , the sign@@ ments will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the use button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , it is always done when you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata to always written into the images . &quot;
&quot; the section rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars , and can be used in searches and sor@@ ting boards . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard interface . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written into the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ note view shows a search box to the filter@@ ing of the keywords , the keywords , and a selection box with the previously shown in this &amp; digi@@ ous ; session en@@ rolled . &quot;
the sampling tree will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the key@@ word . you can limit the number of possibilities in finding a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of key@@ word .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is another relief when entering key@@ boards at a picture series . if you have entered various key@@ word , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set via mark@@ ing of the respective attachment fields in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view , and select a key@@ word on the keywords , this will only be applied to the not@@ up@@ scale image and not on the whole selection , if you want to select a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section : &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar key@@ note filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - file , key@@ word and search views . if in addition one or more key@@ word filter is used , only the cut@@ off of the two are displayed . all mentioned keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drag them . suppose you have already chosen several images in the main view , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put on the selection . then a dialogue , you ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to one keywords , which was drawn up with Str@@ g + a , and then a key@@ word from the right sampling tree was pulled up and stored there . a dialogue asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched between settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : entry to which in the database is looking for . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key term , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) The argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a B@@ ot@@ ated search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button Select group@@ ing . the options then look like follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Flick@@ r not listed ? the free space site is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I did it mainly on &amp; digi@@ tization ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you use a colour@@ ing work@@ flow , that is the colors available from your camera or scanner . with a colour@@ ful work@@ flow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor have the same color and the colors that you print or on the web publish them from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic on colour management comes , everyone wants to know which buttons he must push for the results that he wants . unfortunately , colour management is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information and make your own informed decisions to make you obtain the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow meets all of the criteria listed , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other images can be sent by E @-@ Mail or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of the de facto standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if the R@@ GB works so well and makes life for all so easy , why should one use another color foam and have to get thoughts about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente and then click on information and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ rest my monitor if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , or not , you need to work your monitor , as s@@ R@@ GB does not work out the circle . if you are working as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , you will need to either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use a suitable monitoring profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool has five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try an additional manual processing . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize the functions of norm@@ alize the same , automatic break@@ up and contrast with your colors , try automatically out of your colors to make the best . you will be experimenting with this effects to see which acts best with your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sk@@ ali@@ ates the leu@@ st@@ stronger ke@@ epers over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is as bright as possible without his colour sh@@ ado@@ wing . this function is often a stomach correction for images that are dark or balanced .
&quot; this method j@@ us@@ hed the illumin@@ ator of the colors of the chosen picture , so that the hist@@ og@@ ram of the intensity as is as flat as possible . thus , it is a very powerful surgery , which causes either a miracle by a picture or it was destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic shut@@ down : this method maxim@@ iz@@ es the color area in the red , green and blue canal . it uses the dark and bright border tones and j@@ us@@ hed the red , green and blue @-@ channels on the complete hist@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method enh@@ ances the contrast , and the light of the R@@ GB values of an image by the shift of the lowest and highest value on the wid@@ est possible range and a re @-@ angl@@ ement of all values in between . this is only visible in adult images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the whit@@ ew@@ age @-@ equal of &amp; digi@@ tization came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the whit@@ ew@@ dness of a photo .
&quot; the white cut @-@ like correction is just limited to a color foam with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are travelling too far from the original picture can occur areas with over@@ exposure . in case you can perform the white comparison in raw mode , so your options are better to fix the correction . &quot;
this tool is based on a whit@@ eb@@ radi@@ cal@@ ming algorithms of copy@@ ri@@ ghted by P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start it via the menu item colors white comparison of the image processing .
&quot; the pre @-@ pattern can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original picture and the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original white images , then it &apos;s enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ anz of the pixel under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ming .
&quot; right upstairs is a hist@@ og@@ ram displayed that dynam@@ ically is changed once you have a parameter . this hist@@ og@@ ram is very helpful , even in well illuminated pictures , most of the pixels very small gaps . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is shown . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your outcome depends on shadows , s@@ ati@@ ation and gam@@ ble . the shadow judicial system lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even sil@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; using the controls on the above controls , you should use the color temperature @-@ Pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and follow it somewhere on the picture show around the color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of preference . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ load indic@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color @-@ channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white comparison . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
&quot; the buttons Save As and shop make exactly this . each setting of the white balance , you can hereby save it into a text file and re @-@ load later . &quot;
the button pres@@ ets puts all the filter@@ ings back on their default values and the associated @-@ neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save this your original picture is changed .
&quot; you can set here the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ung@@ es per colour canal of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit code is better suited for high quality pictures . this code also requires more record , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images , it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . paint mapping may be carried out through the sub @-@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can drag the chapter colour management . &quot;
another important tool is available in the menu under colors pick@@ ups . this tool makes an integrated path to save several color channels at the same time . this is useful when your camera or your scanner always need the same mistakes and you will therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for the ton@@ ing correction you will find more information .
&quot; a very powerful way of correc@@ ting problems is the tool for di@@ ad@@ ation , that you can find under colors gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; tool color effects provides you four colour effects , a bicycle configuration , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ ata filter available . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar panels was also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , a effect of that was created when one formed a partially developed pressure from a short light@@ ning . this has the effect that the ligh@@ tening areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second ill@@ um@@ ination . the result was a part of neg@@ atively negative of the picture . this tool allows you to interpret this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controlled the solar panels . at about 50 % intensity the image shows what chem@@ ically possible . another increase finally generates a negative image that is not on phot@@ op@@ api@@ er .
&quot; this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and that works ( 2 ) . the intensity of the intensity is 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filter si@@ sts the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Eff@@ ect . it is different from a satur@@ ation by doing that he makes a stronger contrast effect , which makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it simply , it exc@@ el many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optimized colour film created by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film , and thus a reference for its smooth sculp@@ structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as offers strongly saturated colors with day@@ light and high contr@@ asts . however , Vel@@ vi@@ as offers strongly saturated colors , but also some photographs , especially those who have little landscapes ab@@ rupt , too much . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter si@@ mu@@ til@@ ated ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast . the parameter level controls the brightness of outcome and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . for big pictures , the filter can charge the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contr@@ asting and the light intensity of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors . once you are satisfied with the results you are using the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of raising them . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tools of Gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool key @-@ correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog leads to this tool very complicated , you need only the area of sli@@ der . more concrete the three chic@@ ks below the history . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ming , of active channel or selected area . under the graphs are three slides in which to change , the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and to watch out how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand side you can view the original and preview of the image . preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the image , updated . on the left the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted , whether the hist@@ og@@ ram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a constant color , the linear hist@@ og@@ ram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic graduation is useful . &quot;
&quot; three shelves : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three colour modes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically add the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic judicial system . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each sector . there are also two shelves to modify the output values , e.g. to create an easy picture as background to create something else in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the images are automatically put into dependence on the intensity of the image . &quot;
&quot; save and charging : with these buttons , the data set in the file system can be saved and later loaded . therefore , the Gimp level format will be used . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ ads , the input values will be automatically re@@ formed for all shadows , means and sun @-@ sounds . activate the original image to use the input values of the hist@@ ograms for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ load indic@@ ator controls all the dy@@ channels to find over@@ load pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see an example of the adju@@ sting of the input values for the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original is displayed as well as the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this cas@@ ket there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode is generated a wide beams . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues . &quot;
&quot; if you move for example a spa to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with dar@@ ker for@@ ks and that the associated sculp@@ tor are dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it and off until the value is j@@ us@@ hed to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save and shop : with these buttons , you can accurately do this . every corner you have created it can be saved in the file system and be loaded later . the file format for this is the Gimp Kur@@ ven@@ format . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create this method and the three color pi@@ ping buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original picture to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ators curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ load indic@@ ator controls all the color channels to indicate over@@ load pixel . if in more than one channel you will see the combined result , you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that has been fixed in the L@@ umin@@ ous canal . Sch@@ atten@@ - and sun @-@ sounds was used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; sculp@@ ting is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
&quot; with the channel optional , you can select the color for the hist@@ og@@ ram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the original area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as comparison of your own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you can position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right down : Reg@@ ulators for Red , Green and Bau allow you to mix the appropriate brightness as well as you can also activate the appropriate color components . this is particularly practical if you can also adjust the appropriate color component . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the appropriate color component . try the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix way@@ flow , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise which occurs from the color @-@ floor , which does not appear in the same place in the color canal and how the noise is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your Monoch@@ rome Con@@ version in which you first reduce the color . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each mix@@ er setting can save you for later and then load the file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option over@@ load indic@@ ator controls all the dy@@ channels to find over@@ load pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re@@ formed . the option L@@ umin@@ escent is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action ability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work@@ station since color pictures can be converted to the computer . also with a set of movie roll@@ ers profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
&quot; green filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white film exposure to a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . thus like the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter . &quot;
orange filmed : sim@@ ulated a black / white movie exposure with a or@@ bit lime @-@ filter . this improved landscapes , maritime scenes and air@@ photos . thus similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange filmed . &quot;
rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white film exposure with a red lime @-@ filter . this creates dramatic Heaven @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ atic effects for day@@ time . thus like the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) red filter .
Gel@@ b@@ filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white film exposure with a yellow lin@@ sen@@ se . this is the most natural color ton@@ ing and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium @-@ tones while it adds up a bit col@@ dness in the sho@@ cks and re@@ development in a separ@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool texture , you can use decorative textures in an image . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait out of enlarged points , or like a wall @-@ picture on a wall . the menu @-@ entry picture texture apply for this . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the sem@@ bl@@ ance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is no easy task . a possibility to keep its attention is to keep the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ iss@@ ful eye . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter set the desired wire type for your picture . hanging it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , ch@@ ew@@ ed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button @-@ p@@ ect and decorative adds a decorative frame with mu@@ sters . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value for the width is 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target picture will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool to cut off . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert an out@@ put@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text box , orientation , color from the color tree and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you &apos;ll just choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ clear background . &quot;
&quot; each adjustment you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool sten@@ cil , you can put a sten@@ cil on a picture . &quot;
the template &apos;s picture sten@@ cil uses in the image processing can be used to put on sten@@ cils on a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and the orientation . however , if you want to work the P@@ NG fil@@ es@@ ystem . if you want to add your sten@@ cil ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template ; if you want to add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ tization @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; when you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings are measured for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root canal is set for the sten@@ cils , a tree @-@ view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder update the pres@@ sive view of the sten@@ cils . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the enlargement factor and the position of your image . &quot;
&quot; enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the lying picture . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; smaller : this kno@@ b res@@ ized the image below . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to re@@ vise the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the image under the sten@@ cil picture . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; OK , when you want to apply the template on your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatically . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ous came ; sets three different tools for grin@@ ding . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for grin@@ ding . it is very fast and simple , but , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular pictures . &quot;
in@@ sharp@@ ness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to let a picture shar@@ per . actually it &apos;s not a bit ; it works rather psych@@ os@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s just a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gimp and he is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; re@@ vocation is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adaptation . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common color combined with only minimal difference . the same phenomenon can be observed if colour points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more bear@@ able sharp@@ ness as normal cameras for private users .
&quot; in JP@@ EG @-@ pictures , frequently a camera has been applied internal sharp@@ ness . pictures in the raw format , on the contrary , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner turn a sharp@@ ness already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by using a photo with the sharp@@ ness tool . you can call you with the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; however , you should now deal with caution as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the need for shar@@ pen@@ ing of an image is to raise the tool . you can also find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too scar@@ ce . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool to sign up with the menu entry . use the effect on the right @-@ hand side of the dialogue it shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ ask@@ eting is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
&quot; the original image , and the preview help the picture to process . it shows the issue of the filter with the current settings . &quot;
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values generate often good results and should be tried out first . an increase in radius or the amount will reinforce the effect . if you generate the sharp@@ ness mask , the noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will produce close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a canal are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images permit larger radi@@ i . they should therefore take pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wis@@ ely image that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the Corpor@@ a value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference . one can therefore define a minim@@ ally difference thus for a c@@ ind of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence beauty errors in faces , heav@@ iness and water surfaces have been avoided . &quot;
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image is the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ ask@@ ets was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a pig value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ous came ; tool Ref@@ res@@ sing re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted de@@ activation filter @-@ algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries one picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused ; this is a better approach than just trying to raise the picture . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . it uses a technique called F@@ IR @-@ mask . it is used to start using a technique called F@@ IR @-@ mask . you can start it from the menu by entering colours Ref@@ res@@ sing in the image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular fet@@ us works far better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which does not affect the mathematical result from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is even influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel . which causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most pictures should set the default value 1 good results . you can put a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red then however at Hei@@ ligen@@ sch@@ eine .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1 ; &amp; eg ; 0.95 and after@@ no@@ . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . however if the smoke filter is too low . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still further wast@@ ed . &quot;
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . use these parameters for the pal@@ p@@ ile Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sch . in most cases you should use this value on 0 to avoid frau@@ dul@@ ent arti@@ facts . in most cases you should pay this value on 0 to avoid frau@@ dul@@ ent arti@@ facts . so you may have to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ den smoking filter .
&quot; mattress size : this value determines the size of Transform@@ ation@@ sm@@ at@@ rix . an increase in the mattress size can generate good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular loop or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s Sch@@ är@@ p . note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; save time and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each re@@ vocation parameter will set you , thus it can be saved for later and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible but later left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
&quot; if you want to read images and com@@ press pictures ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ com@@ pressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , bl@@ ur mas@@ king better results are produced as sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by bl@@ ur the bl@@ ur mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ness . &quot;
theoretically it has to be inv@@ alu@@ able mas@@ king always need arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of in@@ sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the ideal Lin@@ ear Fil@@ ters . virtually is the result of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture has been done with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of shooting , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address below . &quot;
&quot; the controller sets the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the parti@@ te , in order to generate a natural P@@ up@@ ille . &quot;
&quot; the color tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ ca algorith@@ m was developed by the image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains various preferences as a starting point to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below : &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the filter settings , you can also use the rider and advanced settings to it . &quot;
&quot; detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ing about the image . a value of 0,@@ 9 should receive details so that no tigh@@ tening is necessary . please note that should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the judgement addi@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; jud@@ ging dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small number smooth@@ ed in all directions while a value close to 1 is just in one direction . if you have a film @-@ gr@@ itt or C@@ CD Rau@@ schen will produce a high value cor@@ rug@@ ated pattern . JP@@ EG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best handled at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor about all@@ ot@@ p then the relative smooth@@ ing . put this value fits the degree of smoking in your picture . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image , even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ ck effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ petition : returns to how often the algorith@@ m is running . normally here 1 or 2 is out .
&quot; angle @-@ gradual da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should be small as it should be small . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs . &quot;
integral ped@@ als &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step @-@ wide in pixel . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the more quality that you get through the selection of this option is minimal . but it doubles its term . we therefore recommend it out .
&quot; buttons Save As and shop make exactly this . each adjustment of image errors can be correct , saved into a text file and will be loaded later . &quot;
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however it can still take very long and a high CPU load gradually pull off . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b break@@ down .
below you can see how images can be corrected with baby art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is set on a photo that was caused in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a poor movie storage during the trip is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; smoking @-@ reduction is a very powerful tool to lower images . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool presents selected image filter available to remove patches and other art@@ ef@@ acts which come for example from dust or hair on the lens , it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ an@@ ute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on sensor@@ n digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular smoke that can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot;
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the lower window details and the sub @-@ window settings can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) up to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for filter . great values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can deny the image over the radius , and the color in it is gri@@ lled and so that smaller errors are cleared . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the pixel seal . this value sets the pixel filter at the front . if it increases , smoking filter orders will change . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and smo@@ ker or lubric@@ ate occurs again . &quot;
edges : controls the sheer precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot remove the entire noise or smoke tips . put it on a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a wax or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
illumin@@ ants : controls the radi@@ al intoler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details controlled by the details .
color : controls the color toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the details controlled by the details .
&quot; Gamma : controls the gam@@ ma intoler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas which typically are stronger , to increase . however , he also merge the shadow areas too . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the judiciary of the ph@@ as@@ mo@@ ist atten@@ uation . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is respon@@ sive . if he raises to high , the edges can occur . he can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at the edges and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; save and loading : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the smoke reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how smokers can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the smoking reduction has been applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ acking for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , fortunately , it &apos;s much easier to draw a picture with the menu entry . use the sli@@ der on the right side of the dialogue it shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; these filters to restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts of your images . it is very well adapted to remove the Gau@@ ß &apos;s film , scrat@@ ches , com@@ pression compact , com@@ pres@@ sive images and thus receive the content as it does the human eye . &quot;
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and text release . the text box is done with another tool that was mis@@ use . the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by the image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the com@@ pression of JP@@ EG is not perfect in some areas even very far away . as a loss of com@@ pression com@@ pression mode ; - small standards that are displayed in the un@@ com@@ pressed picture . this attitude aims to correct these problems .
the buttons save as and shop make exactly this . each setting of photo Restau@@ ration can be saved into a text file and re @-@ loaded later .
&quot; photo Restau@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and a high CPU load gradually pull off . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button button . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with equ@@ er@@ mig@@ es smoking . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gr@@ itt on faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old colour photo that was caused by a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that have been caused by sc@@ anners and the phot@@ op@@ api@@ er . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; this &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos available with a C@@ CD camera gem , eight were used to remove algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , total or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem since many cameras with JP@@ EG com@@ pression over an embedded repression of hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ tr@@ tional method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will be automatically detected by hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
&quot; when you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by C@@ CD Def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in previous section , you should download the matching picture picture to the correct picture . please note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically invite this automatically at the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and the P@@ review will help you to correct the result within the picture . the preview of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are lifted in all areas of view .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish these pixels . these are the available filters :
&quot; average section : it is determined an average of the neighbour pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 of the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels on the block .
square : this is the standard filter@@ ing method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calcul@@ ating a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
&quot; Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) , or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels on the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , which is applied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Li@@ tigation correction is a tool to correct the plac@@ et@@ ting , i.e. under@@ coated corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; for@@ angle lenses , particularly those in the middle and big photo format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range no even@@ ly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting &quot; &quot; ; ( sh@@ aded ) it can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; but he also has cons . many center @-@ filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which should keep it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . continuing object lenses , also using center @-@ filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise adverse effects can arise through motion . &quot;
&quot; with the vast cover areas of today &apos;s film and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by taking a ä@@ qui@@ val@@ ent transformation in a raw image which is applied without this filter . the tool sp@@ elling correc@@ ting is protected by John Walker . &quot;
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fication correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , what an optical filter with a bl@@ ending adjustment of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of Vign@@ et@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and Gamma settings : the editing of an image with the bac@@ kl@@ ine correction reduces the light of the target with these options . you have to re@@ configure the coating of the target with these options as you only have to increase settings only . &quot;
&quot; if you want to a fin@@ alist re @-@ ring the exposure of the target image , so let the values for illumin@@ ate / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gr@@ ading from the &amp; digi@@ tization . image processing of the menu color Gr@@ ad@@ ation . &quot;
this is an example of the authentic@@ ation correction to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ et@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and double @-@ correction is also carried out in the image with this tool .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ dson . &quot;
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gr@@ ades treats the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or condi@@ tional form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gr@@ ades has a similar view , but fl@@ acht at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth grass fixed the remote corners opposite the second ridge . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion almost eliminated .
&quot; in general , this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second atro@@ cities . with negative values , tonn@@ ages may be corrected , and positive values can be distor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the Gr@@ ades . this value affects more to the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Four parameters has converted the sign of the parameter . &quot;
z@@ oom : this value sk@@ ali@@ ates the image size and thus leads to the correction of first atro@@ cities . negative values enlarge while positive the picture is smaller .
bright : this value j@@ us@@ hed the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as default values . &quot;
the tonn@@ age or kis@@ ses correction should be done before all cuts or size changes . at best you can cut this correction as all the first . if you make a picture new and then perform a tons of correction if the effect would be apparent to the ball .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to help you display this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move the mouse button in the picture show around the edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection , you can fix the tonn@@ age / cl@@ ause with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a pil@@ low distor@@ tion , the resulting image black corners will have the resulting image black corners . you can transform these with the fe@@ eder tool in the menu , cut off the image processing or on z@@ oom Reg@@ ulators of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the tons @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives as e.g. recordings from the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the all angles at the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight adjustment of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ age applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method used by infr@@ ared of the G@@ imp@@ ot@@ u@@ .org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this movie has an awareness range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can select the range for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can adjust two parameters set up film coverage and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option of the gr@@ itt and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter colours used to reproduce by infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel does not make sense the effect on black / white photos as the color information are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared fil@@ mm@@ ers applied to a country @-@ photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working picture below ( 2 ) to see . higher ISO values generate a sort of au@@ ra in the top light .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter movie gr@@ itt is a simple to use tool to reproduce the film tracks in your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers large silver gran@@ ular of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ effects gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the untreated image gets a timeless atmosphere rede@@ emed from everyday life . if you want to use this specific , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ny sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the Kör@@ ner can be calibr@@ ated . the default value , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more Kör@@ ner , so you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ label on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and which worked the ( 2 ) . the used hyper@@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter oil paintings generated the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and lac@@ tation are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two shelves to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush @-@ size between one and five out . th@@ icker br@@ ushes are better suited for big pictures . smooth@@ es controls the smooth@@ es or , from the other side looked , the hin@@ d@@ iness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ete is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coal in drawing . therefore , pictures of their gra@@ ins are slowly changing . it &apos;s helpful in which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate yourself . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator cho@@ oses the height and the lower j@@ us@@ hed the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of a coher@@ ent record . the original image ( 1 ) , and the changed image ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adapting of the intensity . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous came ; filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was p@@ opped in wax . it used a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ tization came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important to the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ tory landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows you to adjust the contrast of the filter@@ ing . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter@@ ing . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of distor@@ tion . it used by copyright @-@ protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells , and lets it look like it is considered by gl@@ az@@ es . &quot;
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ el@@ blocks 1 the picture is distor@@ ted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects anytime with the button button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of shar@@ pen@@ ing effects . it used by copyright @-@ protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ har@@ p : wi@@ ped the picture along a star @-@ shaped lines that run from a central point . this sim@@ ulated the in@@ sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sport photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture by turning the pixels around a focal point . this sim@@ ulated the un@@ har@@ p of a revol@@ ving camera .
distance un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back into the background .
&quot; movement @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulated the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : out of a car or train photography , camera . &quot;
sof@@ tening infin@@ ity : wi@@ ped the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright pots . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sho@@ ok bl@@ ur@@ ry : wi@@ ped the image by random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulated by this makes the in@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent in@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color @-@ bas@@ ins in the picture and caught them without the rest of change .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and created it then by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button button .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this makes it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n &apos;s copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m .
&quot; dro@@ pl@@ et size allows to change the size of the drop . as the trop@@ ies size does not automatically increase the size of the picture . number changes the number and the density of drop . fishing changes the optical effect of drop in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can keep up with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; images can hold a field free of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , for example a face which shall be free to stay . if you start after this filter , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) points a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . you will find the tools to transform you in the menu or transform mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo blo@@ ws is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is simple . the big question is , how can you observe a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ algorith@@ m of this here is a good work . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change the size uses a linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation method to absor@@ b the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for up@@ lift@@ ment . &quot;
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation such as sp@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m Photo rech@@ arge was developed by the image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the entry of the new size is maintained the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult , if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ge effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons saving , and loading are used exactly to it . every single source for photo can enlarge as a text file and can be loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo bl@@ asen is very fast with what it makes , but it can nevertheless take very long and a high CPU load gradually pull off . you can break the calculation at any time with the button button . &quot;
&quot; you can see an example of a picture below by clicking on the double size below . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) , the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear default to comparison . &quot;
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a frequent surgery , but also a common tool to compile a picture . image processing allows this very simple . to cut a photo with the mouse , simply push the mouse button , by pressing the mouse button and move the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you want to get rid of the mouse again , the area of the photo will be cut away . this allows you to change the size of the rect@@ angle section by drawing on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle create it simply with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the section , use the kno@@ b button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file save or file save in the menu file to store the newly built photo . &quot;
&quot; in the background area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool according to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of height and width of width is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; using aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you are cen@@ timet@@ res , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ api@@ er and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to create the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; down in the dialog you can contact the Max . relation Kno@@ pf to cut the area to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut off @-@ ratio stores its settings depending on the orientation tool ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tik@@ al ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are stored as standard settings depending on the orientation dimensions . the changed image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data is to reflect the original image and not the original picture . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the comp@@ elling assistance allow you to show up , so that you can better put your images better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ical triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third party , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a way to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the golden middle is a partition that is located on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us sea , or the Bl@@ essed blades of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all kinds of things that we feel nicely . &quot;
&quot; Golden partition is the ir@@ rational number of 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was already used in the ancient Egyptians and the Greeks used to build your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . starting where each number is equivalent to 1 equal to the sum of its two preceding numbers . one composition that is usually follows as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the Golden Center provides liquid auxili@@ ary lines if you put an image below . these help will be listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you to your destination good results for your photos . compared to a third party the golden spiral produces a liquid line that leads the eye of the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called Golden Dawn . it should be something that the eye can be in the focal point of the composition . that can be a line or different objects . this something can just be there without the eye , it will fulfil its purpose . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also leading from the above golden spiral lines . your ver@@ tices are the middle points of the golden tri@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . this diag@@ on@@ ale can place an static object of dynamic . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create a effect of professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image path on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve different . &quot;
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and vertical can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic ponds .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines in your current picture . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to hold the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; picture editing and the tool free rotation . select free rotation and j@@ us@@ ks the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be displayed on the right top . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module free rotation is a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse button in the picture show around the two lines , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ ks the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you turned to the picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix it , it is the function transform or cut off the image processing . &quot;
&quot; an elegant road to cut the picture is the function of automatic mapping . select one of the following options : &quot;
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the shooting . but note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ic transform@@ ations are made to a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ charged . on the right of the dialog , you will find some information which can help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right up : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adapting the perspective the image will be a bit sp@@ illed . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations create an twice as powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after which you have endo@@ wed the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to regret it , it is the picture to be transformed from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; switching tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal loop , e.g. will move the upper part of the image to the right and lower part to the left . this is not turning into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can transform this module into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you are pressing on preference , the angle of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview range . &quot;
&quot; for your help , an vertical and a horizontal line will end . move the mouse to an important point like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse kno@@ b to fix the lines . you can now use the tool @-@ tool to add your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the sc@@ iss@@ ors , the picture will be a bit confused . for a single envel@@ ope , this effect is usually neglected , but two holes are twice as much prescription and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after scrap@@ ing , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transform@@ ing signs from image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of images . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file available on its system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ous came ; shows only files in formats , which knows . this happens on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension was listed in the list , it will change the file in the list . you can change this list of file extension ; you can change this list of file extension . in the section configuration you can find more information . &quot;
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras even allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
&quot; image expression is the use of data com@@ pres@@ sion@@ er to digital images . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced , in order to store the image data on an efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ ked outcomes as JP@@ EG in the same com@@ pres@@ sive version . the 200@@ 0s can also be stored , if this is stated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to find out more about the raw material format , so you can read more about the raw material in English , The L@@ umin@@ ous landscape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw materials in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw image conver@@ ters of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which came into &amp; digi@@ ous . all support cameras can be shown below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ tization : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this cli@@ ps are frequently saved in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . &amp; digi@@ tization ; but it &apos;s not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in options to display or edit . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ tization ; the &amp; k@@ de ; attitudes to play movies to start playing the program .

&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initi@@ ale contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four dres@@ ses with the module of white . &quot;
many tools you need the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ tization : included . your description follows here .
&quot; all imaging tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft@@ ness , ro@@ cking suppres@@ sing , un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ eting , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialog type that is applied to the effect on the current picture . below you see &quot; texture &quot; &quot; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progression @-@ bal@@ es shows the status of the filter on the current picture . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison of the pre @-@ area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected pres@@ tige .
horizont@@ ally share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower the filter is applied to the range below the selection range .
ver@@ tically split . the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
horizontal components . the upper section shows the original and the lower to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the area range , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn off to show over and exposure . the colors used can be adapted in the general introduction page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame to select the review . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and on the part of the picture , from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the left hand corner : here is one help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings of the final use of the module will be made .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when it is available .
this rider provides an intuitive pattern tools available based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ Program . you can capture and move the mouse button . drag the pictures within this coordinates . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this will keep your pictures ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to manipul@@ ate color pal@@ ettes and to pick and use of colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files that are operated by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and ad@@ mitt@@ ent colors . &quot;
&quot; in a dialog , they can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the folder of files . &quot;
c@@ ursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked the area in addition to a color .
it shows the color of it . the color is described under the pall@@ et view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to pick up . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor over there . afterwards , move the mouse at penet@@ r@@ ter lin@@ ker button . &quot;
&quot; if the starter field can add c@@ ursor under the button color is inserted , the color is inserted from the color board at the c@@ ursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ written one . this mode allows you to adjust by clicking the cross @-@ crossing with Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color note , followed by a row values , if another color follows in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; &quot;
the colors in the range and output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them on the left @-@ hand selection on the left side .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphical vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs are used in science and in particular in technology . so far there have been no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graphs and graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programmes by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of an well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program program .
&amp; k@@ nu@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for the viewing of &amp; graphical vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Grap@@ h ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; presenting the graphs and in &amp; graphic inter@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ nu@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to present more than this node )
&quot; other required software : &amp; k@@ nu@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which sets the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graphs required . &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you open &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer : without an argument , the main window will open only the icon file and the ( empty ) list has opened the list . click on the first icon to view the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; once you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower left scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the character . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and r@@ under without special keys , left and right at penet@@ r@@ ter &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graphs .
&quot; if the file has been modified in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re @-@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings Ex@@ graphical viewer ; see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open an Graph@@ ite outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to present the lad@@ ders in a sub@@ window of the already current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice but also change later . &quot;
&quot; you can also define how the Grap@@ h should be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs that are to come to a page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective sections of graphs . &quot;
Sitemap with one on several pages distributed Grap@@ h without head@@ line and with a different font .
&quot; the page again shop provides the possibility to set the behavior when a file has been altered on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page opens the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; to specify when a Grap@@ h is open out of a running session . you can set a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window or determine in a sub@@ window of the already current session ) or determine that each time is qu@@ eri@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the site seat administration gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session open or not ) , or determine if needed at any start afterwards . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , usually with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; appears , opens other options : &quot;
here you can choose among various &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m ; the standard for specific graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or cor@@ rupted represent@@ ations of arbit@@ ration . the algorith@@ m lays the edges in the same direction ( from above to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as a few cant@@ ons as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ coated graphs . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ ite model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorith@@ m is used , the syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimension@@ ing scale . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorith@@ m creates for un@@ coated graphs a spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ int model and layout . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ mo@@ ver for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ st@@ alled graphs
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorith@@ m regul@@ ates the k@@ not circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , where you can specify a Lay@@ out@@ command , which is then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of graphs after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a lay@@ out@@ command you can change the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms special options , or can also change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ just ) and turns the default algorithms for the respective type an ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is activated , the overview is displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it is not shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module images can be used to send new images to invo@@ ke new images and fix@@ ing them .
&quot; this module can be used to invite new images to engage in external sources , and can be used . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
images sc@@ ans : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures of a scanner which supported by the SAN@@ E project or another source like video streams . so this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E .
&quot; when you scan the menu item &apos;s menu , a dialog will be able to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source of that you want to get the picture . you can also put the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the given default values in order to select your picture according to the button . check the image size . the estimated fil@@ esi@@ ze is displayed in the right , lower corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window will be completely indicated , as some settings otherwise may not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window will specify the options of the target image . here you can select the com@@ pression and type of image file . you also need to select the com@@ pression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved . &quot;
&quot; scre@@ enshot , you can generate after you selected in the menu of Im@@ por@@ tier@@ - &gt; screens ... a window appears in which you can set the various scre@@ enshot : &quot;
select the entire working area to log in to a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when All your own program window is selected , the retri@@ eve program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read after a short delay , the currently visible workplace , only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; delay determines how long the scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you turn on other working spaces , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to get there . &quot;

if the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS sp@@ ur@@ dates are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
&quot; the devi@@ ation for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera . lies the vari@@ ance among them , the data is mer@@ ged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have a trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds then all images in this area will be cor@@ related .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ neys and difference in min. can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a local time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ish . &quot;
the coordinates can be set with this dialog manually . this is useful when you &apos;ve made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog will use the coordinates of a call for the next notice you only need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo .
&quot; loc@@ ating can also be found and set up with the shown map and expand it . select this over again , until you have reached an increasing accuracy . the height must always be chosen manually . the map can be changed manually between card@@ mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ ve tool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums on a picture gallery from HTML sides to the version 4.01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML sides , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . &quot;
the module has four riders on which the settings can be adjusted . you &apos;ll need to select all albums on the right . you &apos;ll need to select the albums on the right . you can quickly select a large number of albums on the right @-@ hand side . in the area the Al@@ ben@@ pre@@ schau and the text is displayed in the head of the HTML side .
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely explic@@ able . the option is displayed on each image to create an own page . if you then click on a picture , the image will be displayed directly with your default screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , appear . &quot;
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related pictures . select a folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color depth you can change the standard color depth . the influences of course also influences the file size . all other settings are explained even .
&quot; the tab is allowed to tell you some of the settings from the album tab for the view@@ points , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user to how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages automatically , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore start the program@@ m@@ ors in order to indicate whether error occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically launched in order to show the preview of the gallery . press Sh@@ ake to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Calcul@@ ator is allowed to look at a selection of images and use on them basic surg@@ eries such as filming , zo@@ oming or rel@@ oc@@ ating . the viewer is characterized by shor@@ eline and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in the full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG is a tool @-@ free module is a tool to change images without inter@@ fere with your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JP@@ EG @-@ format , without the usual losses in quality or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the waste @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no com@@ pression of the color information takes place . this can also be found at P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital@@ kam@@ era Camera is a tool to connect to your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module Metad@@ ata editor currently does not have documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import -@@ function of the met@@ ad@@ ata modules , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file dialog with which you want to copy the target menu . the data will copy the met@@ ad@@ ata dialog . the data will be copied after you pressed to the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work in all picture formats . you can copy from anywhere from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported while writing . please check out what formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a number of images into an MPEG video in form of a sli@@ deshow .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG @-@ Video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; all images will automatically choose the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can choose a background @-@ color for the chosen video format . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you must first select the images to be packed in the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can start using extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change the list of images or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is presented and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds to indicate the one image below . a lower value creates a sudden , a high contrast is a very smooth picture change . &quot;
the background colour can be set next . in doubt you should let them black . the name and the path of the created file can be set up under the name of the MPEG @-@ output files . keep an eye on that .
&quot; if you specify a audio file under name of the audio file , so this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can get a coffee from the speed of your computer , and enjoy the sli@@ deshow whenever you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ ans or tools are missing , you can custom@@ ize the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right bottom . &quot;
&quot; the desk assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard sample sizes . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve , or print with the Gimp module for direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your images stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the commands , tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original description of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your cam@@ er@@ ator . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converted window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can look at the effect of your current settings to the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now optimize the values new to optimize the converting process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be j@@ us@@ hed . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in the R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the con@@ duction . the fil@@ en@@ ame stays equal and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG is using a distor@@ ted algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , maintains all the information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to process your images frequently or use later otherwise you should not use the JP@@ EG format , since it is only limited number of operations before picture quality is deterior@@ ated . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are contained in the RA@@ W file in the JP@@ EG @-@ file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , so you can break down . &quot;
&quot; the stack mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode therefore if you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single picture which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the options available are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is useful , however , if this has been created in a previous attempt . a preview is not available . however , the progress @-@ bal@@ es shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ com@@ press all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Im@@ age@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can make the picture smaller or enlarge . these include four types of picture change :
&quot; proportional ( 1 d@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image of screen format .
non @-@ proportional : not dis@@ proportion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; preparation : preparing the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images before . further pictures can be drawn up on the list of images and put it down there .
&quot; after you started the module , the images will be shown with the pictures selected by you . via the button pictures you can add more images . for the last chosen image a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag the images to the picture list and add it to the list of images below .
with the button images remove the selected pictures from the list of the images are removed .
&quot; after you have selected all pictures , you can open the New news -@@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected are already attached to you . &quot;
pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it &apos;s possibly a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is stored and each time you use it again until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the correct path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the comment of comments in a attached file , the comments to the pictures will be assembled in a text file and the mail attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to using text files as e.g. T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG when you have a quick internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise , we recommend you to JP@@ EG @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under pictures file format , and the original files in JP@@ EG format are , then the original exit data will be added to the images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically closed you to check the status messages , in search of errors , see . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the button Close button , you can narrow this window ? en . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module &apos;s advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window appears with questions like you have shown your sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selection of you selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation apply very elegant pictures via OpenGL . however , you will need to possess a corresponding Graphi@@ cs card as otherwise the slides can be very slow . &quot;
you can see the fil@@ en@@ ame file that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation appears in a final loop . you can manually break afterwards with Es@@ c .
the option pictures happen to be acci@@ dental that the images are shown in a random order . so it is not used to order the images in the album .
&quot; under delay between images , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set up . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , this is the best distance before you show the presentation your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen over@@ transi@@ tions among which you can choose . acci@@ dentally , in every transition between pictures and images . &quot;
&quot; during the sli@@ deshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module is currently using the currently selected image , depending on the chosen option of the basement , as a background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your images and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , so in individuals , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have entered information as you look at your images and videos with notes , look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course to look at the current view@@ points . in the following , each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; when you press the entry with the mouse , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the images are shown on which both persons are to be seen . by this method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can see with Th@@ umb@@ nails , to see the images of your experience . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol before her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person has a dedicated image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to display images next to the name , select the button that you want to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . you can choose the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with pictures of people and at the same time provide a list of keywords ( if you have no appropriate images ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to define which image for each individual needs to be displayed . now , you will need to see the picture @-@ clear window as described in the context menu . here you can choose the image for the appropriate person . you can choose the image factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image should be displayed or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; when you call the entry folder , you will see a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for the fix@@ ing of the image properties very similar . you can see this dialog on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a sequence in the cap@@ tion or description , the compl@@ ementary text or descriptions of the images will be searched for . if you want , you can also enter a date according to the item ; the date can either use a section of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene are de@@ formed . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but rather want to try out the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick entry to the scre@@ enshot of the scre@@ enshot and the introductory videos .
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu item for the first time , or select some example images and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can download it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . one picture of this bar you see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you fil@@ th statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the time line can be used on the following ways : you can select the indicated entries selected from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview display ) and also displays the date on the current date of the currently displayed pictures , if you navigate in the preview View . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar , selecting the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so if you select a range , you will see in the preview View only images of this time frame . you can break the selection by clicking on one beam of the time bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provide you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images , which is included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the one is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create about the HTML menu . &quot;
&quot; before HTML @-@ Pages you have to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each section is described more exactly . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the excess and a description that is to contain the HTML file . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is to be created ; -@@ export file should be created on the overview page . more information on export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed without description . for example , all pictures of a party are . please note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example , all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewer . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are obvious , so it is not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the pictures . therefore , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download it for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your side may change the resolution at any time you have set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he &apos;d like to see an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting area , you put the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; in the best way , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you &apos;ll need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder is stored and when the next time is automatically added . this folder you can choose either a folder or one of K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can check if this really is displayed for viewers . if you have been created for the basic folder , the URL you have been created . otherwise , the web browser should be started in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the files provided by you are not yet in the final target folder , you have to manually copy it to the final target folder , see correctly the final goal of the files will specify . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; the described settings options have been referred to all three on bas@@ ins or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is laid out , whose name you define in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family @-@ party , a meeting at the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to create an HTML @-@ page for viewing the pictures , then you &apos;ll have to take a lot of time for it , then you &apos;ll have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not even be done . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image features are ex@@ porting and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ according to whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is stored in the file , that you can have all pictures attached to the file . however , the obvious disadvantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File ... or create together with HTML @-@ Pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the pictures in two times . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export pictures described you can export via the menu file . &quot;
the main option of this dialog is whether it is to act to internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
&quot; if you choose to copy the images to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atic near the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the pictures automatically copy for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most pictures have already been com@@ pressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it usually does not want to com@@ press the files . if you &apos;d like to com@@ press this , just select the option expor@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit Maxim@@ ale image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , if the .@@ k@@ in the file otherwise would be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file im@@ por@@ ters ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category people to the imported file ( if you are a D@@ ane ) , while this category is called in the third dialogue window , which is to be imported into the third dialog window , and which categories will be displayed in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can import the categories of the file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and watch pictures : if you look at pictures , one often wants to watch photos of your Italy and watch a picture with your boyfriend , you might want to see all the pictures , on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will take the different steps from ( 1 ) to establish the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the search and pres@@ tige , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for the pamper@@ ing of your images . but it also has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual there is spoken about pictures , but often closes this also videos with one . &quot;
&quot; for all his information in the index@@ .x@@ ml file , saves all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml on the top of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can use a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , you can copy to a disk or re@@ visions of the CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used for future starting page automatically . if you want to start another folder with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Picture / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; to set up the menu settings for the menu , you will come to a window by which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user &apos;s manual , you will be explained the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings options and options for viewers . for each setting , there is a comprehensive help available to view the F1 button and one click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described as you can choose for any picture different properties , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section categories sub@@ categories are already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set complete groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a member . &quot;
&quot; in view , see the settings options that are available to the fix@@ ing of the membership groups . with the above listed selection list you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left of the window , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . further information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be viewed via the menu modules . the modules can be described and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help @-@ page that you can call on the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications can be shared among each other , it may be that the modules test with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; just before you visit them on your own images . therefore , demo database you can either go through the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database you cannot call on your own images . do not say , I could not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other uses does not support their pictures in albums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulated it for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; there is sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has been handed over to a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you would like to use the category people , so do people have chosen to view and distribute it to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the area module , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a boot screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , see above a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the moment , there are not much information , since you do not have any information about your pictures , then click on this window , then click on the entry images , which shows you an overview with all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the picture was taken either individually or for a larger number of images added at the same time . if for example shown in all images Jes@@ per , and all pictures in Copenhagen were recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for brow@@ sing and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in a list of three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can use them again , if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the shifting of images within the list : if you have a family @-@ party , and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the names used up to the top are moved to people more quickly and assigned to them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting to date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have any comments on each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and click on these pictures with notes . click in this case just on the front and back buttons , which are located at the image of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and to use the menu item additional items on once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is shown . &quot;
&quot; in the context @-@ menu of the App@@ endi@@ x , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires you just sort of your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can postp@@ one the individual elements of the public domain by drawing the bar which make the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by drawing it outside the window zone . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Kno@@ pf Options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current construction and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely off . if you want to see this window later again , use the button @-@ button options ... and then click here window one / off . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you &apos;ll get an overview with images of the currently selected images , or all pictures in case you have no filter . an example of this you can click here . you can configure the size of the umb@@ nails , by simply down the mouse button with the middle mouse button . try it simply . &quot;
&quot; if you let a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , this is displayed in the picture . if you still have not yet opened a window with a picture of a picture , a new ad document will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the picture show . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete or select in the Edit menu . now you can see the window you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use it with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the pictures anywhere , so that you can get the images anywhere . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures in which the right upper hand is cut off , are not stored on your hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the viewing photographs can be displayed , so you can see the preview of these images . however , you can not see these images with the picture . &quot;
&quot; as you see this feature you need to copy files from the folder and copy it again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not wish to ask the one of your images , please buy a larger disk in order to store all the pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can see the pictures that you want to watch for others and click on the menu . alternatively , you can also check out all the pictures that you want to watch for others , and select the menu item everything out of current view . &quot;
&quot; with this , you set out what pictures are going to be hidden in the case of traps . if you want to lock the laptop with your small sister , simply select the menu item you want to be locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered for un@@ locking the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture is under no way safe to read , or delete all pictures on the disk and on the other everyone , who can access the file index@@ .x@@ ml , or delete the one that with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you are all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; managing and hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to consider them at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for this reason , you can look at the preview , as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the viewer is able to see you in . it is of course the image , but additional all the information you have to enter about the image , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can configure this simple with the mouse and displayed somewhere else . all these options are displayed after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then you can see the published context menu . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them and jump back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as di@@ so@@ w . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then a new image can load after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image after a few seconds . started and stopped the sli@@ deshow via the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the whole square on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full @-@ screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can get in the picture and take out of zo@@ oming . you can drag the plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your z@@ oom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ating key sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is equivalent to the screen of a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos that in turn and rot@@ ate out with the Plus@@ - and we are key .
&quot; with the script menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item note from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it may happen that you can watch a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can watch the picture and configuration dialog of the picture to show that name . however , you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and look at further pictures . &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer in order to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start watching the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you see one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above give you the viewer the opportunity to provide images with features , while you can view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . in view , see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , these are available in the browser . so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can simply use one module to copy the selected images on a CD or what ever you want . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the view@@ points . if you want to view categories in dre @-@ view view , then you can simply push the images to the pictures , after the picture was chosen . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case you are allowed to paint your photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the painted is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your baby later . &quot;
in you can see an image on the painted . to turn the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; take place on the painting menu from the context menu . to finish the m@@ als simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely control , but the documentation for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object @-@ tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object @-@ setting and displayed the object in the wire - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ items are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to include a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select one menu item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have altered properties , click to apply to take these changes . you have invali@@ d values entered , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can put the input cell phone or use the changes to break down . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray , you can enter the dialog dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user &apos;s documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 does not contain the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ ist view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the self @-@ made view and a small example of the scene will be eliminated with the chosen texture . if you want to have selected a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture @-@ map ) , proceed locally . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotating as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pul@@ ling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a range of visibility . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the above @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only shown if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the selected vision of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the property profiles are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it as arbitr@@ ary . you can also save several win@@ de@@ formations and simply change between different agen@@ das . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view , and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views each other , drag the starter in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the cardboard box above . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are sound@@ ing views : views , which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop or click on the small to the left side @-@ up arrow in the header line . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the red bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor them to any place . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with view window order ... save it . it is displayed a dialog , in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to rendering , this program must be properly installed . this manual is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon to ren@@ ders the icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . he determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to insert a scene in various sizes and quality levels , you can create as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images in highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose the following dialogue : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in map map size allows you to enter the width and height of the straight image . if you just want a small area of the picture , select the cross section and enter the picture @-@ section to rendering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the Com@@ bin@@ ational field quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if there is a picture with only one beam depending on the pixels , there may be different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or sli@@ ps effects in turns and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are in the representation smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally see pictures with this feature better .
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the great sampling is adapted to the adjacent pixel ; recur@@ sively because the second method is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive , because the rec@@ ur@@ sion@@ al code depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the first method , follow POV @-@ Ray a beam depending on pixels . if you set the difference between the colors on the neighboring pixels , then both pixels will be calculated by following a certain number of pixels , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a low level of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays depending on pixels . if the difference between the colour values split the pre @-@ defined threshold , then the pixels will be checked in 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be individually pursued and adjusted to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the record can be set up with the lowest value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the Ali@@ asing effect is the creation of smoking for the ray process , called J@@ UM@@ ing . if you turn off on the door , changing &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use refl@@ ections . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map card you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of &amp; Pov@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; Un@@ expected , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu entry , select the menu entry option ... and select in dialogue window a file . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if when import error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can draw objects from the object tree in the editor to import the code text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it adds the code text in the editor to import text file in the editor , simply highlight the code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert HTML @-@ Source for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ amed . usually this is a Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on help in the self @-@ made view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation to the displayed object . place here the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example Al@@ fel@@ dd@@ ata ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files , not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is contained in different paths of the library , the first discovered file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire @-@ models . the second color is used for the display of the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for the display of the selected control points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type labels .
&quot; you can set the object of the points to the R@@ aster in the context @-@ menu of the wire model views . you can adjust here the button dis@@ connected for shifts , sc@@ aling and spin . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can adjust the detailed press for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you click the High Detailed view for advanced proj@@ ections , all the wire model is being used . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions the perspective and the sen@@ k@@ right projection . this property follows a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you see wall view , a wall behind the objects is engra@@ ved . the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you view the ground , a ground below the objects is rounded . the ground is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you activate a cant@@ een , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ ell@@ ation you can adjust . more accurate information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing win@@ ders or create new window measurements . in the section window lines is explained how you can create window lines and store it . &quot;
the Com@@ bin@@ ational field standard window : displays all existing window lines . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window order to start the program .
&quot; the list of existing win@@ ec@@ om@@ inations displays all existing window lines . a new arrangement can be created with the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and delete a selected arrangement with the kno@@ b removal . &quot;
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
&quot; the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can be created with the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; and delete selected views with the kno@@ b removal . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ lock the window below the existing window , with card card , you will receive a cardboard box view along with the previous view and f@@ aves the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have just &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start with no more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate however simple scene , under beginners very popular : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you can use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you cannot setup a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you add any light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have installed all error @-@ free you see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window order :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can expect a reasonable idea of what you expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular , this is the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the scene from the scene of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view item Properties , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray , please find more details . &quot;
&quot; change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is also reserved for instructions , but note that the camera in view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button @-@ button or press En@@ ter , the wire model views and the object tree will immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might add a tor@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body tor@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an understanding method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers easier option . you can use an infinite level as soil :
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree the new name will be shown immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view also shows the plain , although at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane stretched up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can click the entry for the floor if you click on the icon at the object . in this case , you will find the different options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizon , just to get some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little flat at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select how the object is inserted . please choose the name in the object tree . you can preview the name in the self @-@ made view ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments shows only one Matt@@ es black material , because you can always check settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you can now check the colors for the pig@@ ment . also there are many possibilities for this , but do you now have the easiest option . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a color on Qu@@ ader and ball in the P@@ review , click the button below and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is right now . if you get your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color that you expect . here are further settings needed . in the color list you must enter two new attributes , called colour@@ ful . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal , and change the colors in the view of the property units : &quot;
&quot; this step should you simply carry out , since you have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; we have understood the ball as simple as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the property profiles , you can immediately change the settings . put the ball value for radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input table or the button ) , so that the ball is float above the ground , as you have shifted the ground to move a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as seen before , appears the ball @-@ surface as a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material now . as already at the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select a sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click Brow@@ ment , then select the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
&quot; then change the values as in the following scre@@ enshot , and click on or press En@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the settings of gloss effect and reflection are already very good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mi@@ zed surfaces , even if metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you have &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much you can easily create , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer from the perspective of the beh@@ older ( i.e. from the camera that the scenes ) reflects by each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects will affect the visual effects such as fog . thus , the scene will be pixel for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you &apos;ll see without a camera nothing , the camera is your eye , with which you view the scene . without a light source , see nothing , the picture is supposed to be framed , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . it is a new file , you need to enter a name and space . &quot;
the scene has been re@@ produced in the last recorded version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
&quot; you can only select this menu item , if you still have not stored changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly , the last revers@@ ed command . this menu item you can only select if you have used mach@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window order and opens up a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;

a B@@ ump map is a way to exchange smo@@ other surfaces without any ben@@ le on the surface individually modeling and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then moved on to give them a realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by applying a picture file as a colour map . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a more comfortable sculp@@ tor and navig@@ ator . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the button return .
&quot; you can adjust if each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the file in the browser window . then a small entrance field is found in the right lower corner . if a password file is highlighted , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by return from return or &amp; Es@@ c ; &quot;
&quot; in the dialog case - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and processing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , short @-@ command for the display of the display and short @-@ command for each window . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images are open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area filled with the background colour , which you can adjust further down . pres@@ et@@ ting is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for one sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , with the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the coloured beams to select a background colour . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture is , also here the background is filled with the chosen color . &quot;
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so up that only some of the file types are shown that the program can be displayed .
&quot; with this option , the display of the display is increased on the full screen . this option is switched as default . &quot;
determine whether the sli@@ deshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the chosen picture .
&quot; the time span between the picture change at a sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the entry field . the default setting is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated as long as it is broken by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the entry field . the default setting is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in map tickets for the scor@@ eboard and short @-@ command for the browser .
this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .

&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for inser@@ ting images that do not make more than pictures to sc@@ ans and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the file .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by checking the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is opened then a dialog to choose the scanner .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . ab@@ rup@@ ting &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; end .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) treated these options not particularly .
&quot; to view a picture , the user can only launch a pro@@ sch@@ aus@@ can and then start scanning area for the final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started by the preview button . &quot;
to better select the picture the user can get into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also set the z@@ oom so that the whole preview fits into the window .
if the picture has been selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if on the store is selected a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a subur@@ b , how to see below is displayed . when saving pressed , then the image will be saved and sn@@ lie ? s leads to a desc@@ end and you will get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; with the button settings , the hom@@ onymous dialogue is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can look at the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before stor@@ ing a preview . if this review is not desired by the user then the option needs to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images stores them . dialog for stor@@ ing each photo opens the dialog prior to each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , then you need to save it with an generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must save save time without a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved in the option saving without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder is used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture @-@ pre@@ fix for the automatically to storage pictures and also , the proposed name for the image in the dialog for stor@@ ing . that automatically stored a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , if an image is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;

you can set up a list of these p@@ pos and their function . below you can set up a list of these p@@ ump@@ y and their function . you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts into the player window and choose Glob@@ als button . select your mouse button into the player window and select short command ... select .
&quot; you may be able to set up existing multimedia keys , allowing them to function as &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ short commands . thus , make your keyboard to the &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ control centre . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P @-@ interface between Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . such as : &quot;
&quot; OK , the commands options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has a number of own commands options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user ID is not running . &quot;

&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / File you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as basis for your own scripts , or simply to expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing is relatively easy . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the simpl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each K@@ DE installation should be attached . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to call . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts on the default one is written continuously and react according to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even when there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the furnishings dialog . to store the stor@@ ing and loading of the furnishings , each script should take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the work@@ folder to the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is being floo@@ ded . the script could now ask for example , with D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the rod . ) &quot;
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change of volume volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ ize : sub@@ menu item@@ ti@@ le , Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ pped . to delete an entry again , the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; exit , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. stor@@ ing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ script administration can also install script packages that have downloaded the user &amp; B. from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .t@@ ar ) , which can also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ al script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK , 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ sive amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should immediately use your script package right correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main one has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lad@@ ders modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ Parameter -@@ p to get the file right : &quot;
&quot; when your script is finished , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and the link to the wiki @-@ app@@ s.org page of &amp; AMAR@@ OK . hanging . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amin@@ o . script running . &quot;

&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; B. ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ enshot .
&quot; OK OK only requires the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to find K@@ deli@@ bs so ( including the included programs , because &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; required some of them to compile e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window managers will work on the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , but flu@@ x box will work for example difficulties . we try to make sure OK on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the day Li@@ b library . you can check the file by using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . then you can delete the file and create the collection again .
&quot; mostly , it is because Tag@@ lib before reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it into &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used libraries using the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then leads this to overthrow of the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate machines , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use any value of 1 second . &quot;

after the start of &amp; na@@ OK ; appears only a blank playlist . how do you come here music pieces ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window is converted into the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under extras statistics . &quot;
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by users while the points will be automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , you have to display pieces on the playlist . click anywhere in the new application column ; click anywhere in the new App@@ lic@@ on column to determine the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cut Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok in the background is . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select the playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist files with the mouse into the playlist and drop them there , just as you would do it with other files . so simple : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add button , you can store the kno@@ b playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably you will be missing the x@@ h@@ s @-@ config command and install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new . look also to lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extr@@ as E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , this is really ! no ! &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual issue of which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG de@@ code ! &quot;
&quot; it may be ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 @-@ de@@ co@@ ders are supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ ual reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , entry &quot;
run the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with AL@@ SA @-@ S@@ ink , the device has to provide a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows for multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be accessed via a sound card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( software mix@@ er ) . &quot;
the issue of this command should help you searching for the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different proposition ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ani ) .
&quot; this does &amp; AMAR@@ OK . already , do not forget that media should first be de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice when you &apos;re looking for a de@@ coder with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend right on AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real time list ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning ) see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause gest@@ ating play@@ back . read this bug report . the magni@@ fier of the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also be good .
either do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , rus@@ hes &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components to register . perform G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Burg OK in advance ! ) : - load you to download , compile and install it . perform the G@@ ST folder , once as system administration and once again as your normal user . delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; AMAR@@ OK . &quot;
please report about these on bug@@ s.@@ k@@ 12.@@ .org if you have a whole list of suggestions / desires please send it to our mail@@ ing@@ list : AMAR@@ OK @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . Set in your calendar program an alarm and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; start playing back . make sure that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; running before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be arous@@ ed by the gentle killing of music you have stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how can we get the current into &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; running the title if you &apos;re on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the running piece of : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user username AMAR@@ OK player now@@ play@@ ing
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA is available .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changing window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + rights mouse button puts one piece in the click of the queue a bit . by pushing the input v@@ ass@@ el after a search in the playlist the first search results will be played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the Control system ? &quot;
&quot; click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , click the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers should be displayed . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of AMAR@@ OK the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages . what ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK on a local drive left or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the menu on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and move into the desired target folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , instead take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a reduced value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has been performed on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can set the rating for a piece by right click on a sp@@ readsheet heading in the playlist window . then select the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece and edit : rating or F2 . you can edit the review also in dialogue met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of AMAR@@ OK . this means : K@@ DE Pack@@ ages have a fixed publication plan that does not put together with the short @-@ term plan of AMAR@@ OK .

&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please get the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and thus also causes a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; probably , &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine this output @-@ du@@ le does not compile it . you have to configure &amp; shut OK ; new configur@@ ing and install . &quot;
&quot; well , I have not installed OK ; new installed , but the output o@@ du@@ le still appear not . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably you will use a distribution that is installed separately from the actual program . although g@@ stre@@ amer are installed , the same goes for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re @-@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re @-@ compile and install again . &quot;

&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ a bit looking for pieces that does not contain . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syn@@ tax variations by popular with each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment . &quot;

&quot; the kno@@ b New fill the current playlist and adds up to the dynamic mode new pieces . play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; with right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist you have the possibility to click Edit , then the dialog to manipul@@ ate the settings of the playlist . &quot;
enter any name for the playlist one . the name should however be unique to avoid confusion .
&quot; if this attitude is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for coming pieces will be passed and they will not be heard twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces are being played by considering the attitude of play . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added according to each split piece . if you adjust here more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right hand were described already in the previous section . on the left of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart playlist . if you select multiple play@@ lists , it will be OK ; random pieces from each of the crossed playlist . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can modify the settings by starting the script and then click on .
&quot; you can install new &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; scripts open by clicking on script . after you install the script , a new entry is installed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button Show other scripts . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script from then click on D@@ ein@@ stall . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please take a look at the writing of scripts . &quot;
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins will be used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; AMAR@@ OK . the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin simply enable the cross @-@ board next to the name .
&quot; this quick@@ instruction should show you how to create a audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps an audio CD . to trace the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files . &quot;
&quot; this is a dialog window , where you can select which files you want to burn to CD . &quot;
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other lu@@ cid formats , then remember that you won &apos;t get a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can test whether an audio CD was created by a lu@@ cid format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window you can do nothing . wait , until the computer has completed the burner . &quot;

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio files from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the internet such programs are commonly referred to as Ripper .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio data stream . O@@ GG does profits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Pre@@ up and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ coder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 @-@ Dec@@ oder module . &quot;
LA@@ ME : a far developed MP3 @-@ Dec@@ oder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ coder . LA@@ ME is used by the MP3 @-@ En@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for lu@@ st@@ proof audio com@@ pression and de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by the FLA@@ C de@@ coder module and the external audio @-@ coder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ nd@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : further libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ code W@@ MA files to de@@ fl@@ ee it to an audio CD . &quot;
&quot; SO@@ x : an auxili@@ ary program , which can be between different audio formats - and convert it . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio En@@ coder module . &quot;
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : an authorized car system to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing Video @-@ CDs and Super @-@ Video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . it can be useful for example to create char@@ x@@ ten CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different conditions of the various albums lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces can be kept differently according to the normal effect . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and can automatically reproduce all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient way , recently opened projects again . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; the current project stores the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously mentioned file will be over@@ written , otherwise asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save will be displayed with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project stor@@ ing .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project changes and has@@ n &apos;t been saved , asks for what to happen . you can then check out between saving and changes . besides , you can break the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , what has to happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; all open projects and termin@@ ated &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each in@@ stored project is qu@@ eri@@ ed , what has to happen as if you have called the file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select about the published dialog files to add the project . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project display . if the current project is a data CD , the files will appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional kno@@ b Burn , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project has already contained . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can find many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is it ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it is useful when you do files from a previous meeting to the current project . it is useful for you , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders . &quot;
&quot; this feature only appears on an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this feature can remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function remo@@ ves no files from the medium , it only termin@@ ates the previously imported files again . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD copying dialog . this also allows no project file to create a CD on another medium . alternatively you can also burn just one image from a CD which you then can burn sometime later . besides , you should also want to burn to@@ ons if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video @-@ CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD Cop@@ y dialog . this also allows no project file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively you can also burn just one image from a DVD . alternatively , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; opens the dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing model over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which is then immediately supported by pushing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g ) files are currently not supported , but you must use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burns a previously called DVD @-@ screen . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which then can be burned down by pushing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used @-@ standing , and even possibilities to change the size and cut black belts . &quot;
&quot; displays information on the occasional medium . this information is displayed in the ingredients and include characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of the tool@@ boxes of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view one or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , its contents are displayed in the contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locks and un@@ locking the medium or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view one or off . the content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; switched the head di@@ still@@ s in the project view one or out . the most industri@@ ous is a narrow area that contains only visible when the project views contains open projects . the copying view has no real function , it just looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the buttons for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the short@@ cut order below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administration required , you must enter the password for the system administration ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programs can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alise and for en@@ closures of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ interface also . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ features , you can either use the command program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the functionality , therefore , is more likely to give your taste and type of your task , which the programs you can apply . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we take on that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , you must be sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , which all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface between &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and additional features for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ ref e@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ at@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a creat@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one receives a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then reference to the project by means # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b @-@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) : &quot;
&quot; void creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) , creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id ) . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der foo @-@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der foo / foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / foo / bar
&quot; &amp; # audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s and can be stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; -@@ data in W@@ AV files ( com@@ press files ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ans ( com@@ press com@@ pression ) will still be installed from Linux distribution ) . further Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in W@@ AV files stored on the computer ( lu@@ st@@ proof and com@@ pressed ) ; and then
are in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats like the lu@@ st@@ less FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pr@@ .@@ to ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ans are already installed . however , only the code package are not used to compile it . however , if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required . &quot;
&quot; which codi@@ fication / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ans gives a small introduction to co@@ aster , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying by protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of the audio CD ; if not the firmware version of the copying station , it is not possible to handle any of any copying protection ; simply avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ic protection ; simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the entry must be made only once ( the setup dialog may be accessed until a suitable configuration has been found ) , after the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) for understanding the slim approach of the user interface , about which you can frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can change in many formats - depending on what code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can collect &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet , or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step example , there are more information on how this program is used as well as scre@@ enshot with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot;
laun@@ ches out and - if an en@@ coder was con@@ figured in the registration card settings in the furniture store - the en@@ coding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , so that the choice can be read out with another En@@ coder as the standard . it is to note that previously the En@@ coder is con@@ figured in the tab &quot; tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already chosen file is chosen to be code rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
opens the setting dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( like protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; exit ) to configure . &quot;
&quot; opens the main objective dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like En@@ coder , for entry of the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes key quality , codi@@ fier and com@@ pression rates , and helps you choosing the right Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is supposed to be lost , a lu@@ st@@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low com@@ pression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , the information is losing by data com@@ pression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG , have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; freely , l@@ ame will still be delivered with most distri@@ butions available for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ high up to very high quality sound quality ( with high Bit@@ rates ) but compared with O@@ GG slightly more deep quality in deep bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG det@@ ector is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo facilities . today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and the com@@ pression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo facilities with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo facilities with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pression rate approximately 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo facilities with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , com@@ pression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good con@@ ug for music by young people , portable devices and Auto@@ Stere@@ og@@ s . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo facilities . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is inserted manually or by the program automatically from the free@@ DB over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / needed / c@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with code programs , there is often a combination of programmes for the codi@@ fier and these parameters . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ans explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) , if MP@@ 3@@ s will be coded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
&quot; this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters , which can be used ( = button designation in assist@@ ants ) : &quot;
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can download the audio CDs , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of your computer : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am meant to be legal . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; any more or less valuable , so , neither the artist nor the music business can be added . all information can be obtained in a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively used to choose a cross @-@ address ( Send a address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address used when retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries there are copies of the main database . if &amp; col@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally on the next underlying mirror server should be used . this saves band@@ width on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of Spiegel@@ servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively you can download the complete database or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected W@@ AV files , the codi@@ fier and hence the desired file format will be selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for audio data ) and FLA@@ C ( a com@@ pression free com@@ pression for audio data ) on the tab . other Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added on this tab itself . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package has to be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the codi@@ fier is required . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined codi@@ fier . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ans are in the chapter Wel@@ er Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a codi@@ fier , you can obtain more information about his switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a consoles window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) must be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the decor of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reader &apos;s choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step by step example , and you will get enough information to set up the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to read everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable Bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ note ( tags ) .
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . at least it is not necessary to compile source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you write scre@@ aming on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic arrangement of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that will probably be done only once , and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; , what needs to be repeated for any registr@@ ar &amp; CD ; it has to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the codi@@ fication of the com@@ pression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we divide the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to read on any of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is delivered to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces can be read .

&quot; the map @-@ card General settings . here you can not do much to do . here , an additional conversion will be defined . in our example everything will be shown as shown in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; only when you want to ask for full information , so you will be informed when information regarding the generating of sampling ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card @-@ card CD ; select Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
&quot; note : the machine must be linked to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet , so that he can access the free@@ DB server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , begins immediately the out of the &amp; CD ; it &apos;s been dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame / file name and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , further to note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , so de@@ activate the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this is worth using free@@ DB locally on the offline mode , the two choices must be selected at least the first . the mode is set up on the following cardboard card . &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data @-@ request for the retri@@ eve of &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system you get to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything in the scre@@ enshot is pic@@ tured in the scre@@ enshot .
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed among machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to what the server concerns , since many fire@@ walls tend to boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first crossing off should be dis@@ able . &quot;
simply take the settings from the scre@@ enshot of the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp on your computer exists )
&quot; at the same time advertis@@ ed pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and code ? the author knows it not , therefore just try yourself . &quot;
CD ; after reading of the final piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you use this click , then the path must be stored in which the W@@ AV files can be stored , the files in the private folder . if you do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; everything is to enter as it is scre@@ enshot on the scre@@ enshot . the command is somewhat long , under certain circumstances , something to right can be broken up to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned previously , this is adequate for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo equipment . the result is a good balance between audio quality and memory . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags in version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted as required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later modification of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the entry ( including the complete path ) and output ( including the complete path ) .
use the rest as shown in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to co@@ di@@ ous W@@ AV files : at a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that is it , we have just finished the basic institution of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any excerpt of a &amp; CD ; use . if you &apos;ve chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , as the process of reading the &amp; CD is described on the disk . we will create MP3 files , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is described , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is described , and the process of which is described in this section has to be repeated for each read@@ able &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD ; which is not included in free@@ DB , see the scre@@ enshot a little different than the data for a &amp; CD ; with successful from free@@ DB de@@ for@@ ested data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of taking them from the Internet . comments are referred to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , like in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD , could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then search in the section questions and answers after help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully fet@@ ched by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ keys for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you are not selected the cross @-@ area for the automatic de@@ duction of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in dialogue for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have any local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; accordingly to the pattern on the next scre@@ enshot one . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Updated title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered into the input field &apos; Updated titles &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field may be used for the individual comments , the comment field of the album , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful recall of the data from the free@@ DB is the CD @-@ editor not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Ed@@ itors , so that you are not only happy with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters are beginning or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags ; this option is set up on the tab &quot; tab . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the created files later with the day editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ans or file formats . see the assistance for the codi@@ fier to obtain more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which is obvious with the style of the out@@ dated CD ; this example is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data anyway . for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap can be found at Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &quot; OK , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors will be released again and you will see that the fields for the album has already been filled with the included data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the piece of the current piece . the title of the piece is in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third kno@@ b of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign prior to each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so are read . simply make sure that all the pieces are selected , or bet@@ s the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces on once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection out the reading process , then this window appears to be confirmed . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left top half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is read just on hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you &apos;re trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer which you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully coded are marked with a red &apos;@@ X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked whether you have access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to format MP3 . to read out and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program does not have any configuration settings to press this behavior . the only thing that is con@@ figured is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with high @-@ performance machines the result is unclear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem when reading and code ( from however two different mos@@ quit@@ oes ) .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the code . after the last piece is codi@@ fied , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left section of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate com@@ pressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ fier of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous package from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals , compiled by source files , and not intended for users who are intended to compile a pre @-@ compiled package of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many varieties of settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it features scre@@ enshot of different boxes of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked according to the first @-@ time Star@@ ts of the program , with no audio CD ( especially if at the time of the program , no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from unusual short menu ? &quot;
what about it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not be maintained this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; who will always do something useful or change it . at least , following the contact with the author . and if you read this , he agre@@ es this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you succeeded in taking the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N to pick up , then you don &apos;t need these information ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ ace of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others he has not have some properties that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players not have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus working on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ support also work &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it is a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with altern@@ ating color , so it is simple to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel by stro@@ lled keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can draw in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text files ) . K@@ Mid automatically determine the procedure used .
seat support . if you want &amp; k@@ de ; ending a song during the finish of a song , K@@ Mid again starts with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu file . it appears to select the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; it works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and bet@@ ray the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry item from the menu item or bet@@ s the Le@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start , once you draw it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with multiple pieces , they are added to a collection and then re@@ played by each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows to left and right of the Tem@@ plates and thus change the play@@ back speed , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ eberg has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry in the menu , thus breaks the play@@ back . if you play the Le@@ aders while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use textile event , others use lyrics , and another both have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are to be presented and even better : the event type is automatically chosen to adjust the one song , so you can automatically adjust the entry of Autom@@ atic text@@ box , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other species . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to set a event sty@@ p , select from the menu settings the entries of textiles or lyrics . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you put together . these will be shown in the sequence . this section is how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection of collection , open first the collection camp . this can be found in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ise .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and put the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the case in the collection camp . &quot;
into the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when applying the application , this collection is not stored . concern you when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collectors &quot; . there you can add a song with the button Add to add one song . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atic does not add to the collection is not enabled , the opening of a piece the temporary collection is activated and saved . this collection will then continue to be added . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection of collecting , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the set after from the sub@@ menu pick @-@ up of the menu collections , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in collecting , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to ski@@ p a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back conver@@ ged , select the kno@@ b forward piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or push the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection camp , choose the collection of pieces and click the button Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is stored in the verse of &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map which conver@@ ts all events of the Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus can always be a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all Sound@@ maps are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM -@@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you must edit the respective file from hand ( using your favourite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary re@@ ments for the play of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once more , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . for this , however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a paragraph has been reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map @-@ file as an email , so I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is believed that the GM will pre @-@ patches in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds to the tone with number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . this includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here , with the term drum patch of patch is meant , where every sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one who means the tone the clay height of the ever same drum means ( like it own some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how sounds are formed on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you must create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define every channel and instrument several key@@ maps . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the per@@ ver channel . take a look at the key@@ maps for example .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to switch for example the first and second channel , make it simple in the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the perc@@ ussion to have on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered between 0 and 15 , based on the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will naturally be defined in the file . if you try to change the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events are ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , there will always be Patch x . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ qu@@ ette patch on the per@@ ver channel .
&quot; the value for the Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o will be multip@@ lied in which relation Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multip@@ lied with the value n , this is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only forwar@@ ded . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al kom@@ mas are available ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which should play a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der Event with the value of 40@@ 96 , a tone higher . unfortunately , try to find some key@@ boards about two notes up to an oc@@ t@@ ave . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the canal view is a window with a whole bunch of piano , ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these piano , see which sounds are just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can choose a tool , the kno@@ b does not use green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played notes . that view you select in the menu settings below the point of Kan@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed when one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slo@@ wing it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that includes information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , DE@@ B ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; because this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without as@@ we support was compiled . to remove the problem you need a source of source and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start@@ page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree that supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select all the files and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
activ@@ ating previously the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the play@@ back . to restore the standard temp@@ o to click on the LCD click .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window using my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I need to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window switch and drag the desired file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding to a collection , turn off the automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will add to temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so do the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ M. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then turn off to play also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs , or see the postcard , animated me this , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; I was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) .

and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net that give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition to this can &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which can be found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also look at the development and look at links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an A@@ we card . &quot;
&quot; if you have no sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ en@@ ame ; was not yet over &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . however , there is always the window with the play@@ lists . and finally there is a information window , which is only shown when information can be added to it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to retri@@ eve the favorite links below the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries we should use the category Dau@@ ghter playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category will be copied and the play@@ back begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories of &apos; current piece &apos; , television and perman@@ t play@@ lists can also be modified by direc@@ ting the XML configuration files . of course you can only do if &amp; km@@ player / share / apps / km@@ player / , can be changed by an editor . simply by clicking on a name of a category , only the XML content of this section is displayed . &quot;
&quot; according to change of XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu of the same with playlist , and either selected in editing mode or selected a different category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost , if the mach@@ ining mode leave , or another group is selected without using the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during the starting and be@@ aming can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ ger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; km@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the starting time does not need to be short , it will automatically end through the opening of another source . however this would be bother@@ ing during the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g D@@ ur = &quot; in@@ tra@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / en ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suits ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suits ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suits ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; /
&quot; there is a rider to the configuration of M@@ players in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player . here , the path is set from the player and the sandwich size of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playlist at the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; . everything must be con@@ figured by manu@@ als of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ w@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; Flash &apos;@@ can be played within &amp; km@@ player . it can even be inserted in the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
to reproduce the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages may have to reproduce the &amp; km@@ player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime @-@ type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in furniture dialog file formats of K@@ DE .
&quot; the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player , is in a consoles application and after error messages regarding the loading of the browser module to browse the library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; km@@ player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , a pre@@ ad@@ mitt@@ ent back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manu@@ als the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example PH@@ ON@@ ON should reproduce all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; can play TV cards by using a player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be downloaded , the scanner is used to use the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited . &quot;
&quot; to the configuration of the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in km@@ player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Source &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video port . there , ports should be detected from which one is selected . the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support can only be used X@@ Video ( probably this kind of play@@ able video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server needs to be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server therefore needs to be the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
&quot; internally , from KM@@ player to the sources used various names . at the time of the formation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ source , export source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ lists of the playlist . &quot;
are there indications as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ syndrome is to be done as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / c@@ syndrome on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine starts only slow , why does every time my CPU must be tested on their performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ e. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last recorded value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphic user surfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile .
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional let@@ ter@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be accessed on the package &amp; text live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the &quot; &quot; Linux &quot; &quot; file . for installation , documentation of the distribution and installation disc , can be attracted . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow an easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are shown on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact concerning the k@@ ile ; website should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about or when comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile , or are desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list of k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ environment in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling and modification tools for this . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project administration . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to experience should be attracted the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; Kate ; start .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right ex@@ cre@@ tion : L@@ ay @-@ TECH ; difficult to operate , can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can be used . a less demanding but realistic sense is that it comes from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; here only a good urban vision to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to know , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced User , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; just as other mark@@ er languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the general features such as paper format , lateral num@@ eric and text box , the kitchen starts with the command \ \ \ \ document } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ ( document } , and must be closed with the command \ \ \ ( document } . &quot;
&quot; the quick entry @-@ off assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a real function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some options for the creation of the document . &quot;
&quot; document classes : here@@ with is the type of the document ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , Report &#91; Show &#93; , slides &#91; Show &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
en@@ coding : hereby the character en@@ coding of the system is used . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ coding as standard . it should be used UT@@ F @-@ 8x ( correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the usually used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only get in the cross @-@ crossing .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) : the document classes of Com@@ a @-@ Script ( compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users have no worries or do not worry about this . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information can be found in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source text editors - the descent of the used orders , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is likely to be sure that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it &apos;s likely to be saved through the humble appearance of time and time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic ampli@@ fication of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically create a space ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the lie@@ uten@@ ant of the command ( e.g. \ \ . { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; gran@@ ting the sub@@ division of the document in the following items ( part is the worst and sub@@ stan@@ tive element ) : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the document , the single elements can be viewed by a mouse click on the respective . &quot;
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex file . as soon as a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; more common file ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ Price File ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button on the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; code text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contained a description of the form@@ ated document and other information such as font ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , conversion and to print of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and upri@@ ght . &quot;
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ cke search are the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file used with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; -@@ source code has been cli@@ cked out is the exact opposite of it . as soon as you click on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is cli@@ cked at the appropriate position in DVI ; -@@ viewer ges@@ tures .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ code master document can be adjusted to project preferences .
quick @-@ mounting : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; code text will be compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no errors in the source text are available ) .
file surveillance : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file on man@@ age@@ n@@ der@@ cav@@ e@@ â
&quot; when viewing the processing tool@@ bar , the three large number of selection types should be developed for the quick flow of common items into the document . the first selection field is for the rapid division of the document in pieces , chapters , sections , ... The adjustable &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field more is available for the flow of articles such as tags , fu@@ gues , fu@@ elling notes or references . the options available : &quot;
name : with this command a name for a section is created a picture or other element .
cover : is used for the reference to a fixed term ( selection a selection ) .
&quot; when buying a quot@@ ation , a selection list with liter@@ ary entries is displayed . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are corresponding editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã © s is used for defining the font . it can be defined as the font , the Fu@@ els notes , etc . there are the following scrip@@ tures for prop@@ on@@ ents : &quot;
&quot; by calling for &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two choices for consumption : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document types , and determine the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the font &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . the writing is not at the beginning , this can also happen in the text also . &quot;
&quot; once the above @-@ source code is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the easiest way to achieve this is the use of the menu or the touch &apos;s quick@@ ening . &quot;
the source code must be saved prior to the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storage automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document error , should be searched in the recording of errors . when using speed@@ bau should be started . if this is not the case , the recording should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ ish@@ environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the remaining document . for example , a report with the font , e 12 created and only a few senses are supposed to have a different font . the command \ \ { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } ) , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end } . &quot;
the public subsidies are only accessible within the area ( by \ \ or { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ stance ( number ) for public subsidies within an environment .
&quot; there are many attempts to raise the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . there might be some fonts , fats , cur@@ si@@ veness , sub@@ missions , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands may be added either with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ si@@ veness and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } conn@@ ective .
\ \ &apos; rate : created a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ begin { Rate } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text , with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; draw @-@ off language , follows a step @-@ step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; once in the assist@@ ants a little text was entered , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . there should be a quote , a few places in obesity and cur@@ ves and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , can be returned to the editor using Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E ( with internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and spa@@ wn . &quot;
DVI ; is a common file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ Price ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ changing or computer figur@@ ines . &quot;
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed by file Dru@@ cken ( if the printer is correct ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar , the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; code text was created , the transformation can start into curved other formats by means of the driver at the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the most pressing search results , the direct jump from the editor on the corresponding position inside the DVI . file . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . for this you only need to set Modern under settings K@@ ile ... tools B@@ auen .
&quot; to search for the pre @-@ search results , the mouse @-@ po@@ inter is positioned in a row of the source text and close attention to pre @-@ looking hunting . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI . -@@ viewing takes place then . &quot;
&quot; with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; ge@@ ff@@ ed and for the corresponding line ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , as text editor will be specified ( settings oc@@ ular setup ... Editor ) &quot;
&quot; if you are looking to using bul@@ locks of the &amp; DVI ; viewer , it is not possible to indicate an error , this is displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary . &quot;
&quot; the log file expl@@ ores the error source in the source text . in the editor you can look at the check@@ out pre@@ text @-@ error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ TeX errors , and the log file must be shown on the error in the recording and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the template for the document . the pres@@ in@@ aries are : &quot;
&quot; with selection of empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard for a quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; current users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , must be created either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file id or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and select from a file template folder ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing ) . these variables can be set in settings of settings ... settings fitting . &quot;
&quot; when creating its own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are to be replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is used by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and the findings of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way the following steps have been accomplished :
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template can be viewed rather than by default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the internet and replaced the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and puri@@ fication of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) can be done in the menu item directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more Ã ¼ ber &amp; Kate ; and his attempts should be experienced the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can get there directly with reading the captain &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; Kate ; start .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called the menu item reference . it contains an adequate description of virtually all commands , that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; usage can be found as well as their syn@@ tax . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with penet@@ rated Str@@ g key to equi@@ p the &amp; tex ; -@@ word to equi@@ p ; this means that in this way when clicking on \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when penetration of the text with stub@@ bor@@ dered lin@@ ker button , the full text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow buttons with penet@@ rated revers@@ al taste , you can choose parts of the source text in the Ed@@ itor@@ window . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the capacity to browse the most diverse types of sources . for example the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
&quot; many assist@@ ants have been able to list their book@@ marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks , or the corresponding button @-@ brand , so that it is also highlighted this spr@@ ing@@ brand , so that she is automatically deleted during the first entry of a character . &quot;
&quot; the mach@@ ining is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already excellent features , were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special orders for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under mach@@ ining expos@@ ures are included the following commands for the text selection : &quot;
&quot; once a paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph , there is not a text with a single line ( as in other words edit@@ ary ) . this extended meaning closes with it the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text . the only prevention thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is thus that the wast@@ ew@@ d thing are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; this selection has an extended meaning , since this command also has an extended meaning since this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a window line ( * ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for reading a part of the document , it can be removed from this first and by pushing the button de@@ f . &amp; Kate ; offers the full line C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands for reading the text : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of processing equipment .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more prec@@ ep@@ ts under mach@@ ining environment , a simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
&quot; with this command , the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed right in front of the command to pass the environment . &quot;
with this command to end up the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the lie@@ uten@@ ant of the environment .
if the c@@ ursor before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is located at the end of the surroundings ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many sp@@ at@@ ted ambient commands may quickly be lost , this command shut down the most sophisticated environment so that the wast@@ ed environment structure is not being destroyed . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . by mach@@ en TeX groups are a few important commands that suit those from mach@@ ining surroundings .
&quot; with this command , the beginning of the current group is ges@@ tures ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the stri@@ ped cl@@ amps . &quot;
with this command to end up the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the so@@ ften close cl@@ amps .
&quot; if the c@@ ursor before or behind the so@@ ften brack@@ et of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , becomes the other end of the group ges@@ tures ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the entry of many wel@@ ded groups @-@ br@@ aces can quickly go back to the side view . this command shut quickly the most popular group , so that the scr@@ apped structure of the &amp; tex ; groups does not destroy any damage . &quot;
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple application marks are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character is used for two simple instructions ; the sign &apos; for two simple instructions is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and takes two asleep space for the sign for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic set of the double divi@@ ding marks can set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX enter and out @-@ out .
there can be also l@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or fran@@ z@@ can be used . there are also many more languages available .
&quot; when the shut@@ down of Shift ; input v@@ agu@@ ed &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart po@@ int@@ ment is a . if the current position within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) is loc@@ alize &amp; k@@ ile ; not just a row @-@ off , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; close to a tables , close to \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
&quot; some users complain the columns in tables , and thereby arrange all the E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; tries to hide this . when the tab@@ ulator has not been damaged , the tab@@ ulator is not the corresponding , for the columns of the current tab@@ ulators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already provides a good source text @-@ complete understanding , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; to include special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . there are for two different modes of work and the other two are for automatic ampli@@ fiers , and all these modes can be adjusted for different working of working under settings of K@@ ile ... &quot;
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } will &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; during the thread of the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ key , the last letter is removed and disc@@ ern@@ ing , the list is reduced by entering a further letter even smaller . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are transferred to selection of a command . alternatively , you can have a jump to these positions by means of editing jumping stamp . &quot;
&quot; under attitudes k@@ ile ; establish ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists can be made . there can be different winding lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as guar@@ di@@ als of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command Mode is not uncommon for the understanding of environments . it &apos;s always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the appeal of the full @-@ operation mode will be used . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the understanding of the environments on prop@@ on@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; when calling for full @-@ operation mode , the men@@ op@@ ed environment or the key@@ note switch , the command to pass the environment is automatically folded , and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the operation can be completed in the simpl@@ est way and by thread the input will be termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; realize that it is a list of lists , there is even a first \ \ item -@@ command with one . &quot;
&quot; under attitudes k@@ ile ; establish ... k@@ ile , complete settings to these lists can be made . this mode uses the winding list of the storage mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; powered custom lists of check @-@ in strings , which can immediately set up under settings K@@ ile . as an example of a check list , the file exam@@ ple@@ .@@ c@@ wl , in the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word re@@ pris@@ oned wing Mode is introduced the men@@ ding brack@@ et + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; large quantities are not helpful for automatic ampli@@ fiers , however , found that many guar@@ di@@ ans have been written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete understanding of all already written W@@ Ã ¶ h . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ tical over@@ head . here , the swelling can also be specified for the display of the understanding . &quot;

&quot; the dialog , which are designed to include graphics as simple as possible . in the view of the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be taken and observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for outdoor activities and re @-@ assign@@ ments from pages . if the PDF output features re@@ arranged and then re@@ arranged with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to pay the result of the work , it has to be comp@@ uted to compile the source code . all components are group@@ ed in the menu of creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for the compos@@ ing of the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion may be used the button @-@ sided viewer ; 3 viewed , by Alt ; 4 die DVI ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file into a PS file , and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the command quick@@ ening , a viewer is normally called after the comp@@ iling . should no longer be used in the viewer , each time will be a new window . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; in the case of the fil@@ en@@ ame -@@ window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script feature of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the align@@ ing of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the sen@@ k@@ ke bar .
the API @-@ scripts are not yet developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; first , it must be said that the completion environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a very sophisticated system which can be expanded by a variety of different packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help on supporting the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tual ; are supplied with many documents . in this there are a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete operating manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; instead it is ideal for finding a specific form of forms . as it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / contex@@ ts , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as accurate aid offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / contex@@ ts ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that contains a database with all the related documents and to create a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the most important advantage is the search for parcel name or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
&quot; double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the bed of the Le@@ aders , the viewer for the document . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source text editor which can be trac@@ ed on all systems with installed and k@@ ron@@ eous systems . &amp; k@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project , reducing &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains a lot of new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ missions as a surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as sub@@ property . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation , knows the pro@@ c and how over@@ rag@@ ing it is . do we still lift it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal ; simply click on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor . &quot;
&quot; this application is expecting a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the opposing work folder . if not , then they remove the current work@@ folder and enter the folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted each time if you mean pro@@ c .
&quot; as mentioned earlier , each of which has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphic interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply leave the current work@@ folder . if not , then select current work@@ folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a output on screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then it simply leave the current file simply . if not , delete them in the current file and select the file using a different file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed , they click the Well @-@ formed review selection . &quot;
&quot; for use a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; the file specified in the &amp; XML ; ( default ) , otherwise select &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and give them the place of &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) , as well as for the Relax@@ NG review , the specification of the Defini@@ tions UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required . &quot;

&quot; if the file contained in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus should be marked , then let the current file simply select . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file file using the other file sel@@ ector file . &quot;
enter the name of the file as the result should be named . the file is usually stored in her home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait by the additional functionality immediately and you don &apos;t have to wait until someone uses the we@@ ave into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a box , we begin with the menu plug @-@ in . thus , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows to manage and add new plugins , we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it : &quot;
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the addi@@ ction of the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be con@@ figured with shift ; F@@ 7 project properties con@@ figured .
the name and e @-@ mail entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project such as team leader and sub@@ project ladder .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by clicking the team member from the list and set the button below . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) appears named after you are : text .
&quot; nickname and adjustment of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes , see for further information on comments . &quot;
&quot; in addition to an overview of her team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event for information on teamwork when something is happening . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed when something given in the project . an example would be re@@ marked the opening of the opening and closing a message , when a file is saved , or a script that a file is saved into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; on the site event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the addres@@ see list , the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see where such head can be set up . &quot;
remarks are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
type remarks is simple . it can be selected either the notes -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary section followed by the activation text .
&quot; remarks can be sent a determin@@ ant member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the role of the one @-@ mentioned nickname of sub@@ project leaders should be led to the corresponding section or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the note : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting languages which is D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web@@ based form@@ atting and scripts .
&quot; the settings are available via the settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others may be found . &quot;
the settings can set up by means of setting Qu@@ anta . diesel dialog will be covered with some pages that are treated to each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / de@@ preci@@ ation of tags : large / de@@ preci@@ ation of automatic tags . normal Large / pro@@ xy means , the tags are inserted as described in the day @-@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / de@@ preci@@ ation of attributes : large / de@@ preci@@ ation of the attribute . normal wholesale / small @-@ prescription means , the attributes are used as they are described in the day @-@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically closing : when raised , becomes optional for tags , for the final day optional , this immediately after bed &amp; gt ; added . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags automatically include : as above all other tags , with the exception of the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and conclusion : if cancelled , the corresponding final day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic in@@ estim@@ ation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ak@@ ch@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding en@@ coding during ti@@ pping .
&quot; M@@ IME @-@ Typ@@ es : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . by means of the default standard , the default support can be recovered . &quot;
standard character coding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening open files ( where the en@@ coding of the file can be passed ) . this attitude here will be engra@@ ved by the same in the projection ships if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for new files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized for files , but this setting will be engra@@ ved from the same in the proj@@ ectors , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that in a black@@ out or crash into the next start of the program the document can be restored by this backup . this is not the same as the stor@@ ing of the file . it is not yet stored a backup regularly , according to the given time , created . &quot;
&quot; preview and documentation can either be shown in the Ed@@ itor@@ area or a own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , what makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
Set the window settings back next to the next start is useful when the user interface came through by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
the War@@ n@@ ap area serves the taxes of the possibility to rec@@ ti@@ fy the ad of war@@ nings by An@@ h@@ aken by no more .
&quot; the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be defined in the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchroni@@ zation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in its shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the Par@@ ser and the struc@@ tor , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the struc@@ ted tree with the mouse cr@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural @-@ tree settings the visibility of knots in the tree , the actu@@ alizing prevalence of the tree in mach@@ ining and how deep in a change of structural @-@ tree can be automatically opened . blank lines are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups such are , in which the current document has not been found . &quot;
&quot; the area to the fix@@ ing of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that may be un@@ folded in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation something else than in a group is valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plugins can be managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ Applications of the third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or . in the entry of a plug @-@ in , the following needs to be specified : &quot;
address : the path to plugin when it is not at a standard location such as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; Just @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode , check if the plugin denied the store . only tick @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the entry fee is correct . if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it is supposed to be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; starting version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely newly developed . di@@ e@@ Support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been dis@@ continued , as well as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of it a de@@ bu@@ gger Plugin was implemented which allows various Impl@@ ement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , just a plug @-@ in available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; including . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in panel can change the specific settings .
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled , some additional items appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitoring variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all brack@@ ets , with number numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the issue is shown ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger all or part of the following functionality is available .
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger where necessary , or she shares the plugin with to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ese . this action is used by default when a project is opened , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger is not to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part of Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Star@@ te the session . closing the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the foli@@ age to meet requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the View Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger where the execution of the script should start and to send information about the monitoring variables as well as the current line , the execution carried out . when this happens when the script started , the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger where the execution of the script should begin , without information on monitoring variables and the current time number . if this happens when a script is stopped , the execution goes on before a de@@ bug request has been completed , the execution of once a requirement is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next directive in the script without having to enter into the functions or includes .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next directive in the script , whereby possible in functions and includes dis@@ cord . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to go the directive and go to the next , as if there were the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , the super@@ vised value appears in the vari@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable or a new value can be set to a variable . &quot;

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs and how you can , and how you can , better to become better . &quot;
&quot; documentation ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for a@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; features such as car completion and check@@ ups . you allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web@@ developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language and / CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consists of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . day folder , the text and instructions are given faster in a document as a user ever could . &quot;
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tool@@ bar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; day XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the self @-@ designed di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool@@ bar allow fast inser@@ ting tags into a document without any risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; day folder is nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; c files . day folders enter the name of the descri@@ b@@ able language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ tools ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is described in a simple way .
this is the root element of a conference document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but as only one element type not otherwise anything else .
the type of tags is a script feature . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument in function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od is valid . there is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day . that is a only element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only appear once for every attribute . in addition , it lays the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are additional tags to describe how this attribute should be shown &amp; etc . this is a only element item element . &quot;
indicates the source code used for the attributes of the tag Ed@@ itor@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ Metho@@ den@@ name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a method name . the arguments that will be transferred to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can occur for an attribute description only once . it is a just @-@ elementary element .
places the position of the attri@@ but@@ t of a tags within a dialogue it feast . this day can occur for every attribute in a dialogue only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
&quot; indicates a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a single element type . &quot;
there is a list of elements that end a day . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration ; ? XML Version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly insp@@ ected and closed .
&quot; space does not affect anything but pay attention &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces it . this will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog will start at the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and ski@@ p Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the review will be done only at the store of the conference XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ diagram . the file name for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 conference file . in this file a &amp; PHP @-@ file is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; type = &quot; &quot; version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; load _ name &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; version _ name &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string _ name &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
the &amp; c p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor to be att@@ ain@@ able via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings ; it can be edited by a list of sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; c p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; a simple &amp; c p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use@@ able 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3C / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 transi@@ tional ) . if not stated , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
an action can set up with settings actions ... click New action to get the same dialogue :
this action has been designated ke@@ yp@@ . with clicking the user interface can be assigned a key@@ code ; with one of them the current key@@ chain can be removed .
the simpl@@ est promotions . there may be a text in the Det@@ er@@ ated settings and in carrying out the action this text will be included in the document on the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start @-@ dialogue or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scrip@@ ts / apps / qu@@ anta / scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document file is removed : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above listed methods , a script would accept a script of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the selection field input can be determined , which is to send to the default ones . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the conducted application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal edition , written on the standard edition ; error messages , which is to be specified on the default output written by which the value will be set to the selection field : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . in any given case , there are not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add actions and configure your actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; edit &quot; &quot; Day , if available , so that a entry to the process is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ download ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; for standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose mach@@ ining size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol is not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , sti@@ te , further interpreted ) or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled , that click this symbol &amp; lt ; start to insert this symbol ; start to the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button button and continue with other tags , so there is still what is , or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
suppose you want some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar supplement or it should be used to adjust this to better survey by some tr@@ ump in multiple groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I want to choose the den@@ omin@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . according to the selection of the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want to get a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note : how the group den@@ omin@@ ator can support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button on the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; secure in the correct folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be saved in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be saved in the correct folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users is the possibility to browse documentation for the script language or the form@@ ative language you like most . therefore this chapter describes how to use a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Docum@@ entation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might consider staying at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the formats / script / etc . language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then we need to handle the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ figuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # 40@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ .html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ .html ? &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Cont@@ ext@@ 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ .html ? &#91; Con@@ text &#93; N@@ ext@@ 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ .html ? &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example , see you now in the &amp; PHP , documentation is something : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 % , Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction , ... In@@ tro@@ duction = &quot; tion@@ .html ... Language Reference = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . it shows that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess tel@@ ev@@ ade ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the contents of the directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) . &quot;
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention &amp; and &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the section of the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP , script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array -@@ function would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ connect lines . &quot;
a simple list of conf@@ isc@@ ated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c , namely to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you indicated this file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c , and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are well and worth it , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web developer platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the ver@@ ge resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can send by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there will be an Email menu item , including D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context @-@ menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users will be able to download it as correct and usable for publication . to make a useful contribution , we recommend the resources to make a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; after up@@ loading , you are asked about their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several key , you can have a look . in dialogue New resource you need to be empty ( URL preview can be completed ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) up@@ loading , tool@@ tool@@ bar , and in the context @-@ menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still exam@@ ines before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the uncertainty of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . if the integrity are given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation may be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files might be needed in the day XML format . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion may be started from the D@@ T@@ D store and Conver@@ t of a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialogue will be : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Final line : the string chain used in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.01 / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine settings of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion to the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and fully benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort , one must first famili@@ arize them with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them precisely these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ums . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work area divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use , available . from tool@@ bar on actions everything is marked as globally , in the joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the administrator of administr@@ ators different materials , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all done by &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bar with special actions specifically for files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; this &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some major areas : the Ed@@ itor@@ window , the building views , the card makers with information and the tool@@ bar . please hit , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cardboard box with the right button to click on how close the current , other or all cardboard , new , delete , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; legal click in the Ed@@ itor@@ is lead to a further context @-@ menu regarding the recorded document content , such as basic mach@@ ining steps ( excerpts / paste / paste ) , editing of the mouse under the mouse @-@ po@@ inter or opening the file , when the string is called under the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; at the upper end of the Ed@@ itor@@ window , the tool@@ bar of the Ed@@ itors . presently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new features and associated needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon which represents the day , then click on a day that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the designs ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the representation of card makers , project , script , scripts , attributes and documentation are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows the pamper@@ ing of files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as add , removing , up@@ loading , or delete the files from the storage medium with the then displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates are only available for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can click the available information to a script . via the right mouse button , you can edit further functions , such as the script to start , edit or send an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one showing the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ click of an element , the c@@ ursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other buildings . with it can change some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace , which allows the change of all available attributes with a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two kart@@ ing at the lower end of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cardboard box displays information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . thus , for example , the D@@ T@@ D used the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D are shown . &quot;
&quot; this cardboard box shows all errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ boxes are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if they receive a tool@@ bar as com@@ pressing T@@ ar @-@ Archive about &amp; k@@ mail , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; how to secure and load them ! &quot;
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ums ; files on your system wants to adapt to the configure script . to get a complete list of options that can be transferred to the configure script . / configure --@@ help one . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
&quot; if you have problems at the starter von &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path is the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to employ : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would do it for the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to r@@ einer &amp; HTML ; restricted , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now it is far on its way to a general and comprehensive Web @-@ development tool . we can now define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be appropriate &amp; IDE for this . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above mentioned claim has to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based on what someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ ru@@ mor is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows to increase the productivity of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase the productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ coated actions , scripts and tool@@ bar , it may have to be seen without any scripts . ( more about how to find it in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web@@ developer environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a quick web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers sent the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more into the details of the documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL ) in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta , is currently developed and maintained by Eric Laf@@ fo@@ on sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list is updated every time you open a file , which is not placed on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . take a look at the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ storage folder , only a mistake is reported . &quot;
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ brack@@ ets so that they are displayed correctly and not to be understood by the browser as a form@@ ative instruction .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ brack@@ et which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and space in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
&quot; switched the block@@ selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; taste . &quot;
go directly to a po@@ inter number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are out !
is looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed using GUI and pre @-@ defined expression to help you .
&quot; displays the news window , or not an . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
- and switching of the problem @-@ por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ por@@ ter is activated once you switch to the structural tree .
&quot; displays the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries of previous or next , depending on the position of the c@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
book@@ mark from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with file turn .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presented a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory according to new files that might be there . that allows , e.g. copy graphics files into your project folder or to add a sub@@ folder and add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; starting and whether you have downloaded further inputs / output o@@ du@@ le ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; attitudes , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialogue to store your work@@ boxes . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of settings ... added by means of tool , or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the visual range . it does not delete it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you would like to do this . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as a App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ boxes to the main server , where any other can access it . see in . &quot;
loading one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; who made you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own coating format .
&quot; up@@ loading of the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , are to be re@@ ared , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew it , if this global is and a ty@@ pe@@ tion in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , fails the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded materials . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current date dialog dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
activated or de@@ activated the smart inser@@ ting of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ ting by work@@ manship is refused when this day speaks to the rules .
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu @-@ points . click on it . click on a activated plug @-@ ins disabled . &quot;
choose the syn@@ tax mode for the current file . the list of available Her@@ oes schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; choose the type of kno@@ ck password . very useful , if you know people who use other OS platforms to un@@ wrap . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syn@@ tax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; through the external application of tidy .
&quot; instant re@@ connection between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can sometimes need to cause or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the box mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open under@@ window . with selection of a entries the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
divi@@ des the status of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialogue affect every application , which use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
judge the behavior of the Ed@@ itor@@ window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which can change the sequence . &quot;
&quot; this should produce an aid according to the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed but like with every open source project developers can always want to use it . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form can be found here .
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top of the project , for example after filling out the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with shift ; F@@ 7 project properties can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example foo . when entering name , file will be automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ project file . by default it has the name of the project in small book letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , to which you want to access , except to handle local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if one can empty this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote computer might be an adaptation needed . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the Tem@@ plates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar is saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to add files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; if files are to be found anywhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started on a new basis , not h@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise choice of your p@@ inning . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ hook or , by removing the tick , cl@@ ing from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be used in the menu with project properties in the menu profiles in the sub @-@ window profiles .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in described . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( Plac@@ eholders are possible ) which are re@@ fresh with project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
&quot; suppl@@ em@@ ental option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view which is loaded at opening the project . can be read more about project views .
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be adjusted with the button options . in this , the bug search is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles can be adjusted ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile by adding a dedicated construction for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window configuration , you can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete . event actions will occur if a previously specific event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced by now . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
&quot; the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files in the current project can be managed . &quot;
&quot; folder is equally , however , the entries are opening Open and Open with ... in with the right button @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here various profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the place of highly explored files . see also .
&quot; allows the removing of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent the removal of removing . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and forget the program . this possibility is useful when the most common up@@ loading files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the record is not listed on the record .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you want to change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ volume profiles can be created and thus up@@ loaded the project ( or parts of the project ) on different servers . when mach@@ ining , or create a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can not be easily read , but anyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and materials can be loaded and replace the currently open files and materials . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessed via settings tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adjustment from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own method of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best deals with the tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar . use and adding are treated below in the section &quot; Add of tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be adjusted either by context @-@ menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New action , a new tool@@ bar can be used , which can be specified in dialogue , where actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the entries will remove action and display action , are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ boxes ... and setting options .
&quot; templates are in the essential document belt , code cut@@ lets and files for al@@ ign . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates in principle like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link each to the system available directory in the pre @-@ storage space . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary is anything that is not pure text . it can be included any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . bin@@ ational templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre@@ ach@@ tree under global templates . further information on the Tem@@ plates tree is available . &quot;
documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally a simple rum@@ our for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pres@@ ch@@ tree under global templates . see in more information on the templates tree .
this type of templates is useful when not a new document is set based on a template but the same text area always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . there are some examples in the pre @-@ storage space under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates will serve all the sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , conden@@ sed in a com@@ pressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a documentary structure according to Beli@@ eving ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file as a template and save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project location ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pres@@ ch@@ tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on file as a template , save as a local / project location . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with pul@@ ling and deriv@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a pre@@ text folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as pul@@ ling and deriv@@ ates or paste via the file tree of kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a folder in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented pre @-@ oriented advance . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines , or connect dynamic with &amp; PHP ; in addition , one can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very deep . &quot;
the pre@@ storage structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the contained in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / / or $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta + / . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as above .
&quot; to set the behaviour of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and to select the context menu . the following dialogue will be : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled as soon as el@@ ter@@ al attributes have been stopped . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except the regular folder in the pre@@ text box . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , it would appear explicitly activated in this path . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear explicitly with something like text box . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder . &quot;
allows for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines and foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; swelling text editor containing over the menu view . the first mode replaces the Ed@@ itor@@ window in two parts : the HTML Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor appears . then you can edit and switch on demand to the source code in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , which &amp; PHP , shows a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ elier from &amp; PHP ; -@@ Source text . it is not possible to edit them directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , is continuing to edit them directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is active . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the scanning pressure from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchroni@@ zation process between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the text editor will be adjustable to settings Qu@@ anta - After the choice of V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can also be adjusted between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation applies : a small spice for fast calcul@@ ator and a big spice for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tools are created document properties . thus , the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be created . thus , it is used to modify : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pushing the two buttons below or remo@@ ves . one click into the list allows the change of content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to designing the view@@ able pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ Rules with buttons under the list or delete a change in the list . the editing of CSS rules are currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style , by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the c@@ urs@@ ors is as in a text processing , possible thanks to the arrows . under rare circumstances the c@@ ursor happens as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or remo@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is used in the same way via the tool@@ bar , such as in the source text editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identi@@ fier tags do not be removed , e.g. if an anchor tag , any other hand @-@ anchor has to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some work@@ boxes , such as the tables @-@ assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will later be used in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of materials must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the study of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style location can be prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; to be able to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g , except &amp; k@@ de ; yet the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;
&quot; stop in a template , at a place in one of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g loaded style - or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode can be put on a certain file and po@@ inter number and later be activated . &quot;
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g uses the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a paw . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the most up@@ loaded style fil@@ en@@ ame with relative path to the work@@ ord@@ ner con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g Is for example a Stil@@ m@@ all@@ at@@ ei .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible the following entry is possible :
&quot; this command will be checked on a partial or complete agreement with a preference named QNAP , or another model name . &amp; eg ; template agre@@ es with any QNAP ME , which contains the string template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP ME &quot; will be extended according to the rules which are assigned by the specified nam@@ esp@@ ace file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is to be extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested post@@ point has to be dis@@ solved for the related UR@@ I and po@@ inter number . this is automatically executed in the loading of the first templates by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . post@@ ures will be re@@ checked shortly after the start of each run@@ time .

there are many graphic tools for compar@@ isons . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the co @-@ operation was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had been corrected in many places the rec@@ ir@@ ation had been corrected . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together .
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the modified lines , but I could not see what had changed precisely within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the re @-@ reg@@ ation had changed . this changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one row and changes to white characters . later many more useful features were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons , and inter@@ led of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ value file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way co@@ operated is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other in one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to solve the final results . in this editor you can edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three quantum files combined with :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the compar@@ isons and assem@@ ble a complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder you will guide :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and refer to the possibilities of present colour monitors . if you have often need co@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines are shown only in a certain number of white characters , one can look at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no sleeve any more , if J@@ em@@ and the inser@@ tion changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other differs in one row , then the colour indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but in different folders , you can make yourself the typ@@ ology work , by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file completely . &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ame , the selection via the file browser ( File ... ) or selecting a last time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file . you do not have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed . &quot;
&quot; via the kno@@ b folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ ing or collap@@ sing of folders , however , is used for A file , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if collap@@ sing , the input field will be active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output of output . you can step down this step later in saving . &quot;
the inser@@ tion button opens up a dialog with settings . here you can define options before you start with the compar@@ isons / guide .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog you do not need to select the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use pul@@ ling and drop , simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from one editor and let it fall over a track window . &quot;
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar features . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be relatively large expense . you would have to download two corresponding files , then download it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy the relevant sections simply , insert and compare them . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you can &apos;t pull anything out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only drag the case of text into a compar@@ ative window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the pul@@ ling and deriv@@ atives of text into another program than cut and add ( instead of copying and add ) . in such a case your original data might be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window code is optional . ) J@@ ede Info @-@ line has a different color . ( note that window appears to a while . then a small aid window will be displayed in the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees to the color , which file differs . if both files are different , the pres@@ et colour is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is shown in the next section ( together ) . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the meeting column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages the colour is not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + , B. are white characters only in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the conn@@ ection@@ er column of the text is interrupted at the points , where the respective source file has no lines . if the foref@@ ace file is activated , the line is shown on the surrounding lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the compar@@ ative version ) also has an info @-@ line with the title : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains automatic text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved is the store de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons spr@@ inkl@@ es to next little sol@@ dered / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ative patterns are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump to the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background colour for current area and each of the left appears a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes by automatic editing , or by manually editing , no more line will be left in the group ; then this text is displayed in the source ; then this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er you might copy and add elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; assem@@ bling conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function around . &quot;
&quot; note : if in selecting the sources the options ignore or ign@@ ant C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are dealt with as well as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly by images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , bottom , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and shr@@ ank , si@@ w as it can also be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the eye , you can also use the other keys to manipul@@ ate . with the inser@@ ting button you can change between insert and over@@ write mode . ( pre@@ adjusted is the entry mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the Com@@ prehen@@ sive columns synchroni@@ zes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as described in the section and the ed@@ itable deadline has been explained ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the actual / first / last difference ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , next to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image Ab@@ way / Str@@ g @-@ Image Ab@@ way ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all dis@@ solved conflicts also have to be distinguished between dis@@ solved and dis@@ solved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you will need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or string @-@ paste ) , whatever you highlight , automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and adjust the manual copying . be careful with this option but be careful as you could acci@@ dentally transfer the content of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; hands @-@ based systems are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a po@@ orer @-@ character \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved while the next start is recovered and restored when the next start . ( Menu Settings ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but they should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ si@@ ver is presented . if the chosen scrip@@ ture is not supported , it does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be engra@@ ved . on these systems , the kno@@ b settings automatically displays an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the pressures of the tab@@ ulator key is inserted into the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator characters will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when entering or return , the recording of the pre @-@ panel will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board then fall . &quot;
&quot; you can select , which brush @-@ type you prefer for saving . the pres@@ et value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system . &quot;
&quot; while the compar@@ isons of files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step white symbols will not be ignored . however , white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save an arm drop @-@ off &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others are usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; but then files can be activated with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , though they might be different . if this option must be disabled . during which this option must be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in default this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , figures and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the outcome , the differences are nevertheless indicated , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
in default this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
intensi@@ vely searching even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective with complicated and big files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic @-@ ski@@ p mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict is deterior@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; resolve automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( pre@@ defined is manual selection . ) If you only need it from time to time , then take advantage of the functions of choosing a / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter to scan of folders and announ@@ cements to a co @-@ operation . look for details on the documentation to the directory comparison and composition .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and restart so the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is shut down over the control center there . ) &quot;
the following codi@@ fication settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option is used for all entries the upper setting is used .
about the selection fields for the coding appears a short notice what the local en@@ coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the file code for source files . this influences how special characters treat and interpret . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different en@@ coding and be combined . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to save and save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing command , they could possibly not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only determine with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option one can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
turn this off to press Her@@ oes of changes in white characters in the text or overview column . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in the normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colored super@@ visor column . however , you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal yet another over@@ estimated column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on screen rather for long lines . keep simply the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; displays the compar@@ ative windows side by one another , or over@@ each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to bring the files together . a simple click starts off together and use the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as a pre @-@ named name for output files . ( if this function is used to restart it again , the name of the recently used output file is maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the instruction will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own processor that does exactly meet your needs . you can use this function for example , cut interference , or to correct the return . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when presenting this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own processor command , which corresponds exactly to your needs . each entry line must have an associated issue line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when carrying out the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases acknowledged or perl is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for lin@@ ders to convert : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; . * \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; . \ \ U in the set string refers to the found text in the first l@@ amm@@ able string . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words about automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . you can change the automatically generated text : sed &apos;s / \ \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed experiments , you may begin to understand it and maybe you might even like this regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ acy of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for po@@ inters &quot; &quot; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; je@@ ep character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ aliz@@ ations at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions from each other .
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something different like perl . perl @-@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are different with perl . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , perl needs only once ( and ) without the &quot; &quot; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after normal pre @-@ processor are kept for viewing and maintain . the further operations apply only the data that the Zei@@ lers @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the Zei@@ lers focus on the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst circumstances . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ conn@@ ective and merge together . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ;
&quot; can this guide sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes , without they really perform , &quot;
... &quot; perform selected promotions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and run of individual files very similar . you just have to enter the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders be mer@@ ged , folder 1 is used as basis . if no target folder was used , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not working together . to launch this , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during reading the folder you will inform a little news window about the current progress . if you break the folder , only the files are listed until then they were compared . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and a folder of the scan found during the scan , will be shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow buttons on the left / right . the folder menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories re@@ ap the folders and folders . &quot;
&quot; when you double click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it appears a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case the inter@@ connection action can not be started automatically . if this will be started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as can be seen in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical cord , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical to be identical when their entire content is identical . then , the folder has the same color . in order , the age is in@@ significant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow , and later when it is old , red is red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if a A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A file and B file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if a file and B file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder , and if the option directories are synchroni@@ zed . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action can be identical so that the both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but do not exist : together and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the invisible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output only B ; Right after the mer@@ ged &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; when two folders run together and select the option of new file instead of contrac@@ tion ( uns@@ ure ) then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the same date , then a fault error messages : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such bugs have not been eliminated , the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; during which together , a file will be executed after the other . she &apos;s status column shows Fer@@ tig when this collap@@ sed , and corresponding to other messages when something un@@ expect@@ edly entered . if that collap@@ sed , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in setting dialog the file approach is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for detached conflicts will only be shown if three folders are compared or assembled . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either run the currently selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries selected at once . if you have selected all inter@@ contracting actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can bring that together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode , it will be used as a target , when you choose two @-@ folder , B and / or B is used as a goal . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the folder structure , too . there are some options to be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ bi@@ ous surprises : &quot;
to launch all entries / continue to launch directories / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ list ) . to only execute the current entry : choose action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if through conf@@ lic@@ ting data types still invali@@ d actions exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options through , sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; choose if you want to see only what would happen , without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then causes certain actions associated with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( together , a single file ) , then the window will open ( note the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select a directory to continue / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved it , appears a corresponding dialogue . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in an error , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will be able to try to try the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed together . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually designed , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them with later assem@@ bling of all entries . even if this document collap@@ sed or not saved , these entries will be considered . only when you change the composite action , these entries will be repeated again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory compilation with these options :
only files that apply to the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . split the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid Platz@@ er : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . folder must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree . it can be more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as parti@@ tions . valid Platz@@ er : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default &apos; * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree . it can be more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as parti@@ tions . valid Platz@@ er : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default &apos; * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ign@@ ores files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is to be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems you have a verb attribute . in other file systems an index of a file is marked . this option lets you decide whether these files are shown in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on the default .
&quot; in links to files : if the option is off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched off , the links will be treated as normal folders and re@@ conn@@ ectable . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible rec@@ essions . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible rec@@ essions . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible rec@@ essions . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible rec@@ essions . ) . a link to a folder of a link on himself would result in a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stor@@ ing off . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that does not contain text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder via a slow network , it may be quicker to compare only the amendment and file size . however , this vel@@ ocity part does not cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
similar to confidential event date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical if they are the same . can be useful if when copying the amendment is lost . please use caution . this option is switched on the default file .
&quot; enabled the synchroni@@ zing mode when two folder are compared and no target folder has been indicated . in this mode , the suggestions are selected to mer@@ ged . also the results are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of running the copying of the newer file as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe , because it is provided that the other file is not also changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted , the original version will be ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ original file . if an old backup file will be deleted . this also affects the normal backup of individual files , not only the composite folder . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder lead to merge single files visible ; you can switch the window pond with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option folder &amp; text window share the main window in the window menu and switch through a change between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking on . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu item . you can also run a single file directly without the folder you have to run and the file will not be assembled once you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports networking more transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening files that are located on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a zi@@ pped archives with a local folder .
&quot; a URL has a different syn@@ tax , as local files and folders . a few things should you observe : &quot;
&quot; a path can be relative , or .. . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be saved . ( # - &gt; % 23 , id@@ ols &gt; % 20 , etc . ) for example , has a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be distinguished whether a link to a file or a folder shows . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
there is no way to edit permission or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main uses is currently considered the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
normally we need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a ca@@ vities . then it takes &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that if none of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it supports only the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . this mer@@ it or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now Hei@@ st es ) are already there . also the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can be combined how the program diff@@ use 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs for a long time and have learned a lot by reading into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go to him .
&quot; you have to compile the program from the sources and the configure script probably not be the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default settings , configure / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; if however only a non @-@ white characters are different , the line will appear than not identical . if there are other lines appear next to each other , this under@@ is , but this is is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and select the button A / B / C , and it is a lot of effort to design some extra file format that might store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can use a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used for another editor .
after removing text suddenly ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; appeared and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors to highlight differences . even more her@@ d@@ ying would be confusing and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !

&quot; only differences : files which are identical in all folders , are not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version version , you have to re@@ compile the folder after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; there will only be entries displayed , the differences do . this also leads to identical files stored in the target folder . if the target folder does not contain , they are missing in a later program version probably dis@@ changed . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly . &quot;
in default this option is de@@ activated . Under@@ schi@@ ede in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ look of all virtual working spaces . it is quite handy to see the running programs on working spaces , to quit their size , they stop or move them . this works both within a desktop and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can view all the virtual working spaces , as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has been cli@@ cked only the two entries of P@@ ager . but if it is cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; but if it &apos;s cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu appears , and the entries are minim@@ izing , maxim@@ ize the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izing the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when it is cli@@ cked on a application .
send the application for selected virtual work@@ space . appears only when it is cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this cross @-@ crossing is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , will be shown in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual working spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; anch@@ oring this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of the virtual working spaces ; it is shown together with name , the names are provided with folder , &amp; eg ; 1st work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each working area is also displayed as a background in the background . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to make their choice . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays a simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very quick systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classic lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n R@@ aster appear , as from P@@ ager applications are known in some other Window@@ s- ; wa@@ ver@@ cht shows all the virtual working spaces in a wa@@ ag@@ right and per@@ ver@@ tically in a sen@@ k@@ right row , which is very good for the display lateral on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager Mini@@ Program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the windows as symbols or with their content and move . besides , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
&quot; click on the right mouse button inside of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , and subsequent excerpts from the switch . lets the dialog appear . &quot;
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I.

&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a screens ; you can use &amp; km@@ ag ; a part of the screen enlarge , as if you would like to read the paper for various users , such as artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a full manual for the use of &amp; km@@ ag . &quot;
&amp; km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly enhanced around new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start &amp; km@@ ag , a window appears as described above . the main window of &amp; km@@ ag , shows the enlarged range of the screen . in the following , this window is shown as an enlargement window .. the picture that is displayed in the magni@@ fier window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is listed below the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
in default setting magni@@ fied &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the mouse @-@ po@@ inter as a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively you can create a selected display area in enlar@@ ging window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse c@@ ursor on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting of mouse c@@ ursor . please note that &amp; km@@ ar ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse c@@ ursor . this is always the default file ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Mou@@ se@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can shift it with the arrow and c@@ ough and change its size . this can be performed in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse @-@ po@@ inter in the enlargement window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can catch the content of the enlargement window and move it . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you are in addition the &amp; Shift ; taste , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag , has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to add a file to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , the picture rot@@ ate and much more . &quot;
starts and stop the updating of the display . the update of the update causes the needed CPU time against 0 .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , straight@@ ing , means , H@@ och , Very High ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; used automatically your entry command to save files , opening of a new window , prints , new@@ com@@ ers ( with the button document again loading in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fi@@ bers and shr@@ ink &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ar also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screens ; you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to use the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people from the research or artists to the web@@ designer or vision . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse @-@ po@@ inter is distor@@ ted a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer the R@@ SI Syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive syndrome ) , and those of any mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer the Re@@ peti@@ tive strain In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of any mouse click pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the mouse with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that is created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can choose pain that should be connected with the use of your computer , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it once again : although &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps that when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by the mouse caused by the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse click away once you break the movement shortly .
&quot; if the smart push is activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause , after it is running the mouse , it is waiting until the end of the movement , before the slogan is running and execute a little practice , but you get rid of it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this denial must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click away . &quot;
&quot; is Intel@@ ligent Mov@@ ements switched , the filming of shooting ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting until it is left mouse button again , if there is no evidence of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking the clicks and back , followed by a break , a click on right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a long @-@ clicking is saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stream / km@@ et@@ ool _ stream / km@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is del@@ ayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction times . open the sound time to shor@@ ten the sound system and here the rider style . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten you at a lower value to shor@@ ten the answer times . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks , is set &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start with every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . with GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings back onto the values that were set to the opening of the dialogue . have you already put down the button , the settings are reset at the stand after the last dr@@ ape . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use with preferences . in particular , the smart box should first be switched off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later make the smart move . &quot;
&quot; when you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the answers of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in places in the browser window that does not pose a link to un@@ weigh@@ ed reactions . you can therefore park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you are not just clean the mouse @-@ organ but also the roles , which come in touch with the mouse @-@ organ . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball away , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt roads can easily be used with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ el de@@ pot . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when just a shooting process has started . if in this case you use the smart moving , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot end more by the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you are &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can perform yourself a mouse click . this is reset by the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the c@@ ursor to another place . &quot;
solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor to place where you want to have it . but don &apos;t park the mouse on a neutral area of working space if you &apos;re going on a button @-@ neutral reaction . secure zones for the mouse @-@ line are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the front lines of windows .
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent hearing , but I do not make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time , before you can handle it . it &apos;s very well possible to hit the cli@@ p@@ board to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board . but it will probably not even prepare problems . here are some advice to it : &quot;
&quot; use the smart moving not , if you just start to begin &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead , perform a mouse click on the other end of the text , while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and once again hold the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; then use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , every time &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button p@@ ushes a sound like a mouse click . so you can know exactly when when smart rel@@ oc@@ ating the shooting time . later you can use the smart box without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow must be installed . this should be the case on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and l@@ oud@@ speaker and it has been installed correctly .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ po@@ inter is short distor@@ ted . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome , and those of the beg@@ gar of the mas@@ est pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be con@@ figured so that a certain time wa@@ its that a pul@@ ling process starts , before the mouse button is left . in this way the pul@@ ling and deriv@@ atives can be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; km@@ outh . is a program , with the mu@@ te user can speak to their computer for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh ; you can mu@@ te user to speak the computer for itself . the user can choose from a list with the inter@@ relation of propositions , which should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left scre@@ enshot ) enter the command , which will later be used for the language version of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text book . from the text@@ books you can often choose text passages without having to tap . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right hand scre@@ enshot ) you determine the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ ing . &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can get the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can get the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; km@@ outh , is clear and essentially contains an input field for the scanning area of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a memory memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have km@@ outh ; properly aimed , you can enter into the input field you want to listen . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory memory . you can select from these propositions which are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu @-@ entry Settings km@@ outh ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; . this dialog contains two card cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page of vocabulary , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . &quot;
&quot; in the entry field of the box map , enter the command to appeal to the language @-@ generator . in the selection field below the input field , insert the character coding , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; knows two types to pass the text , select the starter field , if the text is maintained unchanged as a standard one to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ crosses field is not selected , the text is passed on as parameter . you can use the following space holder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command of the language version depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation regarding your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this success is to be used as a language service &amp; km@@ outh ; as the first try to further the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications will be further developed on this page . choosing this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop panel promotion following the selection of a text Passage , you define what action is triggered by the short@@ cuts or through the choice of a text guide in the menu text password or in the bar for text @-@ password books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text@@ books is inserted directly and additionally included in the cable @-@ memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text is first entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ in @-@ left of the mach@@ ining window , you can specify if the text @-@ password book at the closing of the mach@@ ining window will automatically be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text matching book , the book will be saved . if you choose changes , the text password will not be saved . select for stor@@ ing , will be saved &amp; km@@ outh ; ask if the text password is to be saved . &quot;
the site Wor@@ ter@@ mi@@ tigation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for vocabulary . in the main window next to the entrance field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field where this list contains more than a dictionary . with this drop @-@ up dictionary you can choose the current dictionary of vocabulary .
&quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete or add a file to the order of books or export it into a file . below the list you can adjust to the name and in the selection field the language for dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is determined simply by en@@ umer@@ ation of the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to just add correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can assem@@ ble the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; then asks what dic@@ tion@@ aries mer@@ ged together , and how this wei@@ ghted shall be . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . because &amp; km@@ outh ; new one inserted words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window to the processing of text @-@ passages is divided . in the upper part , the text @-@ pass@@ ag@@ gs are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text cycle , you can change the text preview or the corresponding short@@ cuts . if you have selected a text book@@ book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text @-@ passages or text @-@ passages can be changed by pul@@ ling with the mouse to the new place , or with the arrows and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ key . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , it will otherwise use the selected areas of the transfer . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , it will otherwise use the selected areas of the transfer . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used otherwise , otherwise the selected test de@@ duc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is indicated , a sli@@ ding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used orders is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged right under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sc@@ op@@ ed left side and pul@@ ling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point . &quot;
&quot; if this menu is suggested , a narrow bars in the lower part of the main window with hints on the condition of &amp; km@@ outh ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu den@@ oun@@ ces is indicated , a sli@@ pping body is displayed on the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the fli@@ pper left side and pul@@ ling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point . &quot;
probably you have the command for voice @-@ over@@ s not correct or not completely entered . open settings of the outh . to set up the page General settings and enter the command for voice @-@ over@@ s on the box map . ( see the dialog dialog for language syn@@ thesizer to further details . )

&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice @-@ over@@ s , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . the voice @-@ over@@ s is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched as a standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into an Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to set the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to transform the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , taking the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to add the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore more costly than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / mb@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data is to be switched as a standard one .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , the all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications provides a standard interfaces for voice @-@ over@@ s . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language @-@ over@@ s systems . &quot;
&quot; as the adjustment of the language @-@ generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use as the kt@@ ops as a language service in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service , which appears in the setup dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is an application , with the people who can not speak to let text be displayed by the computer . it will be saved as a list of already pro@@ filing sets that the user can always use new ones again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
&quot; more detailed user &apos;s documentation can be found with help : / km@@ outh ( enter those URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or run k@@ help@@ center help : / km@@ outh ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of the modules of existing service that allows each application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; a common application position for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer ready to be fitted with their applications with T@@ TS ability .

&quot; the VO takes place via the Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language donations to the command line ( or using shell script ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ auxili@@ ary programme .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s Service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS @-@ services via &amp; D@@ Bus . &quot;

&quot; marriage you &amp; t@@ ts ; use , you must install program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card @-@ card shows is displayed . see also . if you have at least a speaker , the card card will be shown . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those who den@@ otes themselves in volume or speed . you should also use multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use a spokes@@ man prior to you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise use the standard spokes@@ man . &quot;
several pres@@ ets for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several pres@@ ets for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cardboard card box , the card @-@ card speaker will be displayed . this also appears automatically when you start t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and still not have a speaker . &quot;
&quot; all already equipped speakers will appear in this list . the preferred spokes@@ person appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice @-@ over@@ s , if an application does not exist . &quot;
&quot; choose a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; choose a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings below . see below . &quot;
&quot; choose a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list determines also its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; desktop system ;
&quot; select a m@@ oods here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a junior and girl voice . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , appears on the new speaker on the cardboard card speaker . to change the settings of this intercom , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; just go back to map map , and check whether voice @-@ over@@ s are activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de ; start now . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card @-@ card orders to create text orders and manage . see . &quot;
&quot; if you set up at least one speaker , you can start the language fork system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the cardboard card box to open this box map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this cross @-@ panel to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts successfully , the card @-@ card orders is shown , and you can create text orders and read text orders . see . remove the mark@@ ings , K@@ TT@@ SD becomes hal@@ ted and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , provided the field &apos;s language over@@ s ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ crossing is marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the system range of the control bar , it disappears again , once it is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop and resume . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Inter@@ p@@ board to read or open a text file . you can also change the speaker for an order .
&quot; click on or OK , then all changed settings on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card orders is shown only when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cardboard box , and cross@@ ings there voice @-@ over@@ s . ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check out the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time , the language version should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pres@@ ets and other invisible brands also pre@@ read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text presented here . check out the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu tools text . then , the language version should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , like &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the intelligence system of &amp; k@@ de ; that you can notify about of your events . you can also read the text of this messages , too . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; convers@@ ational ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can notify different types of messages that you can notify when in an IR@@ C channel a message emerg@@ es , in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C box . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ fy , appears to be a menu item notified in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ according to application . &quot;
filter for drawing belts offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; heard that is a good example . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml that sends is a good example . it remo@@ ves the tags br and b from the news that can be sent out and also the expression / local / In@@ box since this in most cases can be accepted as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
&quot; in filter@@ ing text is edited , before it is sent to Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for enhancing the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain shortcomings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; different types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the stopped jobs will resume . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of news and normal text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
&quot; messages have the ni@@ est priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application , the news used . while you can see a long text on a website , you can see with &amp; km@@ outh ; someone can also welcome the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order which you encounter from the card @-@ card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that have text orders . text orders are intended for issu@@ ing longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are lab@@ elled in queue , with exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application reads the edition of a screen recur@@ ring , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reads , this issue is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters never apply to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages applied . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future it can be even more types of filters .
&quot; character ket@@ ten@@ sion@@ er replace parts of a text by other text . the transl@@ ative parts you can specify either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre @-@ defined strings as : - ) by text or for the envel@@ ope of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Def@@ e@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to convert into another format . included in the package of &amp; XHTML ; are some X@@ SLT files for translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with intercom optional , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; place ; if you have set the text on the map to read a female voice , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for voice @-@ over@@ s . if the filter does not apply , he will change the text remaining in the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent by all active filters , which have been set up on the page below . the processing of filters is in order in the list from above down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the fully normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be lab@@ eled down from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter here . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following setup di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; for the establishment of strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison list . these patterns will be found in the text , then the text will be replaced by the associated replacement parts . large and small @-@ prescription is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; type a name for your filter . this name can you choose any number , it must be distinguished only from the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column match and replaces him in accordance with the string of the column . the list is shown in the shown order from above down@@ wards .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expressions from a file , store the current list or delete a list of a file , the entries are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language listed here , the filter is only applied if the spokes@@ person speaks for the text order to display a list of languages here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value listed here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by coma . example : convers@@ ational , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application @-@ ID run programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D number ; -@@ Num@@ bers you have to take away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only have to input . &quot;
&quot; the character chain filter will only be applied to the text , when all conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ ciary filter when al@@ located . all input fields is empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the character @-@ chain filter is used in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by parti@@ tions ( space ) attached to them . &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular Ex@@ trac@@ ts &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Regulation &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; sentence &amp; # 160 ; )
&amp; XML ; -@@ Def@@ e@@ duc@@ er transl@@ ator &amp; XML ; using X@@ SLT files from a format into another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such revers@@ al . it can only be applied to your system . the auxili@@ ary range x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the variable variable P@@ AT@@ H , ranges x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker op@@ tionally , you can send text to a specific speaker who is set up on the map @-@ card speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , specify that texts by k@@ mail from a female voice should be read . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker properties , which is the program presented in the text box . with the speaker op@@ tionally , you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the given regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular press , you can call this with a click on the button to get help in entering the entry . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; click here the properties of the desired spokes@@ person . if the text used the above filter@@ ing conditions , the speaker is selected to show the desired requirements at the most desirable . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the speaker op@@ tionally used only then apply to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ ciary filter when applicable . you need to wear at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmers give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD by &amp; D@@ Bus . &quot;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API to be added with the syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer could use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the voice @-@ over@@ s API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand language services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the t@@ kt@@ et@@ d program on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text of the text to read and check out a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all the commands you give
open two &amp; kon@@ sole ; -@@ window . start your desktop in one window , then t@@ sm@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the named voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Def@@ e@@ filter filter , but when using the module for festival websites will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all works . you do not have to do that if you do not use this voice to read them . please make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and to be found via the variable variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or character signs seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thesizer , so all propositions will be issued or only gib@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option is set on the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain character or words , these may be fixed by a character chain filter . &quot;

&quot; the voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers that are used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you can find in the associated documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE @-@ code archive , you can download the package with &amp; desktop ; then you will find the code of k@@ de@@ accessibility by ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

&quot; American English , British , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Bel@@ un@@ organic . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information that are not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ tive module @-@ architecture for language syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , contact the development team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; place , you need a current development environment from K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the discharge files for the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source invent@@ or from the source archives , from the source archive or have downloaded the whole night , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you want to use , check first whether Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher work correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer correctly . therefore , you can use the shell script SPD conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is to be developed the program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . the program &apos;s t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the setup of Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher is possible and the script SPD conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is broken into individual movements . the user can be reset or cancelled , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application text is written on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred spokes@@ person for the issue . thus , if you have a speaker , whose language English and its gender is female , this is otherwise , otherwise , will automatically choose the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about it , see how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a narr@@ ator will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map to add or click on the map or click Edit , the box card kit will be displayed . as an example , the box of the module is shown for festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found here . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is contained at the festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character coding for text , which is given to the festival . in case of voices that are announced , this setting will automatically be made . generally speaking , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders you make speaker , intercom speed and pitch in the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and display this grey , the voice chosen by you are not chosen . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ sy@@ n @-@ voices need to be loaded on account of their size several seconds . if you mark this cross @-@ board , these voices are already loaded in the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so ( with large storage power consumption ) the first sentence is syn@@ thesi@@ zed quickly . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ crosses field cannot be selected , you have not yet installed a speaker ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; it marks this cross @-@ panel , is displayed when starting t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window @-@ window display . otherwise , after the start only the symbol @-@ t@@ sm@@ gr is displayed in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if K@@ TT@@ SD is not yet marked , it appears in the system range as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text . therefore , you have the option to read or otherwise control it . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the currently lab@@ elled set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map @-@ card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can be selected in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . click on this symbol to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card @-@ card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text orders listed and managed . issues of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . for more information on the brief@@ cases of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find out . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio @-@ over@@ s . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled , either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or pass , the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; if g@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output smo@@ ked in the list , you need to install at least one module , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
&quot; Set the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ nbsp ; % approximately the double normal speaker speed . so that these settings can be implemented so@@ x , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; t@@ ts ; system to take over .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , you select standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map card , you can set up specific actions that will always be executed when the text result is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen @-@ re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders and holding these orders . after the edition of the screen reader has been read , the stopped jobs will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have priority priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning stops the issue of news and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to see a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen repe@@ ating , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio over@@ s in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always used when a normal text order is interrupted . if both in@@ duc@@ ted sound is active as well as introductory message , the introductory sound is checked before the introductory message . &quot;

&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice edition . this standard includes brands for controlling the votes , the volume , the sex , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the default language , the festival at the SS@@ ML edition . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or audio at the festival configuration dialog does not apply to 100@@ nbsp ; the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pun@@ is@@ hable recognizable filter ( SD@@ B @-@ filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ ordinate text into individual movements . thus , the first sentence has to be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , as only the first sentence has to be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the whole word order . thus , you can also withdraw or stop on the cardboard card . thus , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the stat@@ ute in@@ fil@@ en@@ filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ posi@@ tional sign filter filter . you can modify its settings or add other stat@@ ute filter , beginners will get out of it . &quot;
&quot; easiest way to read the decor of the intercom selection by try out . place the speaker select option , change some properties and check out how the choice of the speaker have changed . then you can of course have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &apos;s quick to start reading , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not all the text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then hold text orders on the card @-@ card orders or break down , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal stat@@ ute filter filter is automatically set up if you start t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless you know what you do . &quot;
Stat@@ es@@ limit@@ less errors compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ c@@ ading and add a t@@ ann@@ ator ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing limits ( default characters removed from the text ) . notice that the default @-@ Stat@@ ute filter is liable for the character .
&quot; SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ va ) , war@@ nings , messages or the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from understanding the normal stat@@ ute filter filter , you can insert this back by clicking the file included in &amp; t@@ ts ; in the rare file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the map selection , you can write the intercom settings for application . the card card is displayed when &quot;
the use of the standard tab ( the top on the cardboard card speaker ) . in other words : there will be no inter@@ viewer properties .
&quot; the use of the appropriate speaker , which indicates all the features of a fully equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this spokes@@ man . otherwise , &amp; dict@@ ts ; the spokes@@ man , the most originally included properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired inter@@ viewer by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired spokes@@ man . if this property does not matter , give nothing . &quot;
highlight this junction if the property should have priority to other properties . you can also put multiple mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since language is a critical factor when processing the output is , it will always be used as a priority property . it is the only case where you may specify the attribute language , if you know that a particular application will be text in another language than that is included in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the area of speaker , the following the following corresponds to clear , click on the selection kno@@ b standard and then use the speaker , which corresponds to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case 0 for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;

I have loaded an additional voice for festival on the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival but t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the map card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the voice chosen , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed will be ignored if &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( see ) that the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ( see ) or if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ by @-@ SS@@ ML file format , and set the intercom speed . &quot;
&quot; I am unable to pre @-@ read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;

&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . with many voices you can set Lou@@ dness , intercom speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find them in instructions , which are supplied with festival . would you like to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you must compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission . &quot;
this voice sets up to 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in early stage development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / etc / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices you need to enter the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) code as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions too . look for the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option coding must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option is to be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Syn@@ thesizer . then the l@@ ex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA will be generated by the audi@@ ences . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language for@@ ks system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu c@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installing a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , displayed : module settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not installed . physical devices and their drivers have to be functional and configure , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the adjustment of the network properties enables . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . are networking equipment later , the driver must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the nuclear version , &quot;
&quot; module settings will be loaded if the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this , the platform used to detect the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the t@@ anned selection is offered . it is the platform from the list , which will be best adjusted . by setting the setting up non @-@ re @-@ questions the definition can be taken permanently . at the next start of network settings , this selection is automatically set aside . &quot;
&quot; change the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are able to be considered , change the settings is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will proceed by clicking the button system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the overall functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
&quot; the rider network interfaces is for managing the network devices of the system . all available networking equipment will be displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
&quot; the settings sho@@ wn@@ des network interfaces may set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button interface , which can be set up in the dialog device . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Kno@@ pf@@ it Exten@@ ded settings displays the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Autom@@ atic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by an DH@@ CP @-@ Server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required at any system start . thus , no further placement is required . in the selection list may be selected either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , selected . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address must be specified the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field , network mask is to be defined . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at the boot . if the initi@@ alization does not desire , this option should not be activated . &quot;
&quot; in this dialogue , the values described in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device . &quot;
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input for an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or activated depending on your requirements , which can be activated by selecting from the list and click on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or activated depending on demand , and de@@ activate a activated network device from the list and click on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; if the IP address is established in the local sub@@ net , which enables the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ network . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is more than one network interface , the interface has to be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is used only IP addresses . if the computer is called IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; the machine to the nam@@ ing part of the equ@@ er nam@@ ing solution enables a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , remo@@ ves or changed wer@@ den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged through selecting a entries and information or down@@ grade in the list with the buttons , or her@@ ding in the top priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; from the group machine to nam@@ ing a DNS server can add a DNS server . it is displayed in the dialog of the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP server IP address and then click the button &quot; Add &quot; button . the entry is then inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group machine to the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click the button Edit ... It will be shown in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of particularly known machines describes calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used in boats when no DNS server can be available . in small , locked networks , it can replace DNS server . &quot;
normally the list contains known machines some entries to support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still is to replace version 4 in the test version 4 .
type the IP @-@ address of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add .... The dialog &apos;s New Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; insert the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the button &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; button . if the known machine has several Ali@@ as name , de Kno@@ pf Add several times and enter the further Ali@@ as name . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box is displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings contained in your network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable you to activate the changes , it must be set in one &amp; console ; the following command must be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source file .
for installation of binary distribution ( usually r@@ pm packages ) ranges it if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply to download the r@@ pm package and in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool used by its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally , the development planning with libraries and other things will be required . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files . &quot;
this area may not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x is only basic information about the involvement of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently IP @-@ networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been found large distribution . by IP@@ v@@ 6 , it is expected to penet@@ rate itself in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is to as@@ sign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , the &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the network administrator the contact point , which can be used as a valid IP address . in any case , the IP address can not be easily chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when placing your own little ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , therefore its any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be facilit@@ ated by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the range from 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is big for networks up to 250 computers large enough .
&quot; in addition , the network mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the z@@ wide the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = its own machine ) . the standard route is needed for IP forwar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . typically , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes altered at DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than specified there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file will be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore happen .

&quot; at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you will see a list already introduced tasks and related environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root user , this appears both for all users of the system as well as internal tasks . each folder can be up and folded . &quot;
&quot; in a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not shown and under description appears de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; the infl@@ atable environment variables put the otherwise existing environment variables for all listed tasks , except for strength . when de@@ activated variable appears as a description . &quot;
&quot; to create a new task , select first the tasks folder . then proceed in the menu to Edit New .... aging , you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and in the published context menu New ... select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N press . &quot;
type here the name of the start@@ up program . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path@@ name . if you want to seek the program first , press select .... &quot;
&quot; select the minute ( s ) , to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in fifth way . &quot;
&quot; if you choose both monthly day ( s ) as well as week@@ day ( s ) , the task will be executed in both the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the programme will run independently from week@@ days , and also on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active when the cr@@ abs was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , select it first , select the remote task at first . go to editing . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task to select and cut off , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , select it first to copy the task . then head to Edit Cop@@ y . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select copying , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to include a task must first be cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then , inhal@@ ing at all . select the tasks -@@ Fol@@ der . then go to Edit entries . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right button of mouse button on the tasks -@@ folder , or select C@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , select first one . then go to the menu option ... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and change ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog task in which you can edit as described above . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select which to delete it . go to the menu option to delete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or dis@@ able a task , select it , and determine the condition with the menu option . in@@ active tasks are lab@@ eled in their description with in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the task and select En@@ closure . make sure you are looking for the activation that program name , parameters and description will be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to immediately execute a task , select it and then go to Edit Play now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , select first the variable folder . then go to the menu Edit ... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable folder and select new ... click C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
type the name of the variable one . you can also choose one of the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click on the arrow next to the field for the variable name . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the back program to another as the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the cr@@ abs was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , select first the variable variable . go then to editing . &quot;
&quot; to copy an environment variable , you first select the variable variable . go then to Edit Cop@@ y . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the variable and select the variable , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to add an environment variable , first one has to be cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then , the option is to be inser@@ ting at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , select first the variable variable . go then to Edit Change .... aging , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; o .@@ There will then edit the dialog variables , in which , as described above , which can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , select first the variable . go then to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or de@@ activation an environment , select it , and place the state with the menu item . when de@@ activated variable appears under description De@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the variable and select En@@ closure . make sure that name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables has been entered or modified , you still need to store the cr@@ abs . select the menu item Save . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables will only be active . &quot;
&quot; it appears to be the default dialog . if you choose out , see that there are two extra &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ ont@@ ally of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users which have extended authorization .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xy @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; used the cr@@ abs command to change the schedu@@ les of the users . &quot;
a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; used standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&quot; there is a backup program for band@@ ing works on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to record several archives on a tape . the first goal was to answer a question for tar , that over@@ comes the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife presented : how much longer does it take when one sec@@ ures it ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done on three types : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; don@@ ate the band back and reads the pre@@ tension @-@ information of the belt . acknowled@@ ges &amp; k@@ dat ; the fore@@ play on the band will not , you are asked if the band is to be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the precau@@ tions , searches for the matching index on your record . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the band run , to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the stat@@ us@@ bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched out by fold the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; prior to throwing the belt , first the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; , by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration of the band has been solved and shows a message in the status bar . the band can now be rejected without danger . &quot;
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat files can be used it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
&quot; a strap has to be form@@ at@@ ted before you may use to save data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not happen before you may be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy strap is usually assigned to form a form@@ atting of the belt , DAT drives , on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape is lost , the band is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the most secure files . that can happen to three types : &quot;
select a file or a folder in a local file tree . it will be backed only this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files provided in the profile will be backed up .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; click with the right mouse button on the local file tree , and select in the menu of Sich@@ s ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will be secure . the dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
highlight a file or a folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or the folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder is checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu item .
&quot; once the inspection process was started , the dialogue settings for check . in this dialogue you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialogue will be re@@ viewing . this dialog shows the progress of the exam , as well as the data transmission and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage the re @-@ produce , the files must be restored to be restored , and this can be performed on two types : &quot;
select a file or a folder in one of the archives included in the entry for the band &apos;s work . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder is restored .
&quot; right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives , and select in the menu . &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process was started , the dialogue settings for restoration . in this dialogue you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ folder for the restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue will be re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data transmission and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ width on the basis of the band &apos;s contents . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band : &quot;
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
&quot; the current work@@ folder in which the backup should be done . the list of insured files is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder , which are on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry will be considered from tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file in front of the call of tar . this brings that all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings below the menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device machine ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must reference the non @-@ re@@ ap version of the belt system .
&quot; if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; b ; before the band is involved the command will load load to the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or typ@@ ing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the out@@ box at the band &apos;s work . possibly this attitude does not work at all band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , in solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat files , the band is automatically k@@ ick@@ ed out . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy Cand@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , try to change the hardware size for the band work . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must have to let &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band work . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; b ; a band is form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the belt . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N Byte ) The band ID . the format of this sequence is calcul@@ ator : seconds , with calcul@@ ates the full name of the system , on which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds , the number of seconds has passed since the time has been form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup point . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . moreover , our users can access the quick access to information about problems which appear on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer does in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system will be the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems which appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , fil@@ tered with the help of the protocol files of certain programs and be evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot , displays &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are available , with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily fil@@ tered and sort out . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filter@@ ing are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first to open the main protocol file of the system - the system prot@@ ok@@ oll , so you have &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; most probably not with system administration details , so you have &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; most likely not with system administration registration . the protocol files usually found no permission to read for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected crit@@ erion or text box . the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically . in default setting , the drop panel includes the entry all . then a log @-@ line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included . &quot;
&quot; at this point , you can also select another entry . select the string of the filter search engines , then select only with the entries in the selected column . select the name of a process so shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent or created . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are shown with a con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol lines of stage note . the colored representation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched dialog dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context @-@ menu of the main window , to view all new features in the upcoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ org. &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ vs : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . this section leads to a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program in the top of the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is why it is easier to use , powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a rein@@ stall and re @-@ format . therefore , you must make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of direct in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service that you want to start at the top of the system or when changing to another Run@@ level . system services include not such things like set@@ backs , which will only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be in turn under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it does not require a lot of use for this . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run some of what has to do with the rep@@ utable connection . &quot;
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix it , then come back it , by turning the system new and execute : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter it -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is here a link to any of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start the script actually from hand on the command line as : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script is called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server @-@ Run@@ level , which lets only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , which should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another Show is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry out of the area of the Avail@@ able system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can move scripts even between Run@@ lev@@ les or change the position within a level by changing it somewhere else . however , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they pull an entry out of the range of Avail@@ able system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are shifted if you select this into a new zone . to simply select it from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter into the target range -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of a entry may sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ption of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different work@@ areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) and the c@@ ursor buttons , to make a selection of top or below the date . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired @-@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a contract manually , press the input button to switch the Properties dialog . close the dialog by reading copies of entering the input button to change the changes , or press Es@@ c to make the changes . &quot;
because of the risk of data transfer all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
&quot; all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise , they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise , changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ ards and now the machine starts consistently new . what can I do ?
&quot; at LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single , and press the input button to start in a single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and modify the default Run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit extra files in / etc that are only available in this distribution . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services will be started in these distri@@ butions , however , does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan a expansion of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just end up without news , if its configuration files are not found or incorrect . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be available from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or entry in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user &apos;s list . to edit the user or the desired group with a double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears to be the dialogue of user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only shown if you have extended system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a box card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear , in case of shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces are installed . &quot;
the card @-@ card password will be published if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces are installed .
&quot; this map card appears only if for at least one in the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the space limits of data are in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be adjusted for each file system individually . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space limits .
&quot; the card @-@ card group inform@@ s about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group , which the user belongs , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by highlight them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; from the menu user or group or click the appropriate Add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or delete the selected user or the selected group is analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove the time until the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , change , change , change and more . &quot;
