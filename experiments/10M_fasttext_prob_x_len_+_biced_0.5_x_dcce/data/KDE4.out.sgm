<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors pickups. this tool makes an integrated path to save several color channels at the same time. this is useful when your camera or your scanner always need the same mistakes and you will therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for the toning correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">"a very powerful way of correcting problems is the tool for diadation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digitization came; tool color effects provides you four colour effects, a bicycle configuration, a Velvia filter, a neon-effect and a cantata filter available."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar panels was also called Sabatians, a effect of that was created when one formed a partially developed pressure from a short lightning. this has the effect that the lightening areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a part of negatively negative of the picture. this tool allows you to interpret this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controlled the solar panels. at about 50% intensity the image shows what chemically possible. another increase finally generates a negative image that is not on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">"this is an example of the solar panel. the original image is the (1), and that works (2). the intensity of the intensity is 30%."</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter sists the so called & quot; Velviaquot; -Effect. it is different from a saturation by doing that he makes a stronger contrast effect, which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it excel many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight optimized colour film created by the Japanese company Fujifilm, and thus a reference for its smooth sculpstructure. Velvias offers strongly saturated colors with daylight and high contrasts. however, Velvias offers strongly saturated colors, but also some photographs, especially those who have little landscapes abrupt, too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neonfilter simutilated neonlight on the contrast. the parameter level controls the brightness of outcome and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. for big pictures, the filter can charge the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contrasting and the light intensity of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors. once you are satisfied with the results you are using the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of raising them. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tools of Gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / Gamma is the tool key-correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog leads to this tool very complicated, you need only the area of slider. more concrete the three chicks below the history."</seg>

<seg id="443">"with the channel optional, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the original area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as comparison of your own rider."</seg>
<seg id="444">"the preview of the target image has a red marker. if you can position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value."</seg>
<seg id="445">"the controls for the module are right down: Regulators for Red, Green and Bau allow you to mix the appropriate brightness as well as you can also activate the appropriate color components. this is particularly practical if you can also adjust the appropriate color component. this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the appropriate color component. try the green channel for black-white portraits."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when you mix wayflow, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise which occurs from the color-floor, which does not appear in the same place in the color canal and how the noise is different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrome Conversion in which you first reduce the color."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digious came; sets three different tools for grinding. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for grinding. it is very fast and simple, but, especially in dark areas, granular pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">Insharpness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to let a picture sharper. actually it's not a bit; it works rather psychosuell. you can use it to atmospheric Dunst and it's just a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"revocation is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of the sharpness. this in turn leads to a common color combined with only minimal difference. the same phenomenon can be observed if colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more bearable sharpness as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG-pictures, frequently a camera has been applied internal sharpness. pictures in the raw format, on the contrary, must always be sharpened during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner turn a sharpness already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by using a photo with the sharpness tool. you can call you with the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should now deal with caution as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the need for sharpening of an image is to raise the tool. you can also find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too scarce. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool to sign up with the menu entry. use the effect on the right-hand side of the dialogue it shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred masketing is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">"the original image, and the preview help the picture to process. it shows the issue of the filter with the current settings."</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate often good results and should be tried out first. an increase in radius or the amount will reinforce the effect. if you generate the sharpness mask, the noise and the impression of grats will produce close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a canal are affected by the filter. high-resolution images permit larger radii. they should therefore take pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wisely image that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the Corpora value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference. one can therefore define a minimally difference thus for a cind of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between tones of sharpening and hence beauty errors in faces, heaviness and water surfaces have been avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image is the (2). blurred maskets was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a pig value = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious came; tool Refressing refocused a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted deactivation filter-algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries one picture to & quot; refocused; this is a better approach than just trying to raise the picture. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. it uses a technique called FIR-mask. it is used to start using a technique called FIR-mask. you can start it from the menu by entering colours Refressing in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular fetus works far better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which does not affect the mathematical result from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauß's Faltung is even influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel. which causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most pictures should set the default value 1 good results. you can put a higher value if your image is very blurred then however at Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1; & eg; 0.95 and afterno. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. however if the smoke filter is too low. a usable value is 0,03. a high value is still further wasted. "</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche Schärfe. use these parameters for the palpile Gauß'sch. in most cases you should use this value on 0 to avoid fraudulent artifacts. in most cases you should pay this value on 0 to avoid fraudulent artifacts. so you may have to increase the correlation and / oderden smoking filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">"mattress size: this value determines the size of Transformationsmatrix. an increase in the mattress size can generate good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular loop or the Gauß's Schärp. note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"save time and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each revocation parameter will set you, thus it can be saved for later and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible but later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you want to read images and compress pictures; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally speaking, blur masking better results are produced as sharpness. this could be caused by blur the blur masking a larger neighborhood as sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to be invaluable masking always need artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of insharpness. for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the ideal Linear Filters. virtually is the result of the FIR Vienna Filters always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture has been done with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of shooting, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address below."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the controller sets the insharpness of the partite, in order to generate a natural Pupille."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the color tinte allows a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inca algorithm was developed by the image team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">"this tool contains various preferences as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:"</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to use the filter settings, you can also use the rider and advanced settings to it."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailing p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing about the image. a value of 0,9 should receive details so that no tightening is necessary. please note that should be subordinated to the judgement addiction."</seg>
<seg id="520">"judging dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small number smoothed in all directions while a value close to 1 is just in one direction. if you have a film-gritt or CCD Rauschen will produce a high value corrugated pattern. JPEG Artefacts are best handled at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor about allotp then the relative smoothing. put this value fits the degree of smoking in your picture."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image, even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmock effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetition: returns to how often the algorithm is running. normally here 1 or 2 is out.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-gradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should be small as it should be small. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral pedals [0,1, 10]: integral step-wide in pixel. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2. "</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the more quality that you get through the selection of this option is minimal. but it doubles its term. we therefore recommend it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">"buttons Save As and shop make exactly this. each adjustment of image errors can be correct, saved into a text file and will be loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however it can still take very long and a high CPU load gradually pull off. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how images can be corrected with baby artefacts. the module is set on a photo that was caused in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a poor movie storage during the trip is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the lower window details and the sub-window settings can remain in default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) up to 20 (41x41), which is used for filter. great values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can deny the image over the radius, and the color in it is grilled and so that smaller errors are cleared."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the pixel seal. this value sets the pixel filter at the front. if it increases, smoking filter orders will change. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and smoker or lubricate occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the sheer precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot remove the entire noise or smoke tips. put it on a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a wax or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Illuminants: controls the radial intolerance of the picture. we recommend you either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the details controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">"Gamma: controls the gamma intolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas which typically are stronger, to increase. however, he also merge the shadow areas too."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the judiciary of the phasmoist attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is responsive. if he raises to high, the edges can occur. he can remove noise and phasenjitter at the edges and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">"save and loading: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the smoke reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later loaded."</seg>

<seg id="546">"these filters to restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts of your images. it is very well adapted to remove the Gauß's film, scratches, compression compact, compressive images and thus receive the content as it does the human eye."</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text release. the text box is done with another tool that was misuse. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the image team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far away. as a loss of compression compression mode; - small standards that are displayed in the uncompressed picture. this attitude aims to correct these problems.</seg>

<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image of screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">"preparation: preparing the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly."</seg>

<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays depending on pixels. if the difference between the colour values split the pre-defined threshold, then the pixels will be checked in 4 subpixel, which can be individually pursued and adjusted to further subdivision. the maximum depth of the record can be set up with the lowest value."</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is inserted manually or by the program automatically from the freeDB over the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / needed / caudiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with code programs, there is often a combination of programmes for the codifier and these parameters. the manual or the help to the Kodians explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day), if MP3s will be coded with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"this is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters, which can be used (= button designation in assistants):"</seg>

<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done."</seg>

<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package has to be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the codifier is required. this is also required for the pre-defined codifier. more information about Kodians are in the chapter Weler Kodierer.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events are translated into events that understands the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI-map which converts all events of the Type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Trumpet and thus can always be a trumpet, if originally a piano should play."</seg>

<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you must edit the respective file from hand (using your favourite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary rements for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once more, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. for this, however, that every appearance has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1660">"please send me your map-file as an email, so I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM will pre-patches in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all sounds to the tone with number M (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun powder. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here, with the term drum patch of patch is meant, where every sound is a different percussioning instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one who means the tone the clay height of the ever same drum means (like it own some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are formed on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you must create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define every channel and instrument several keymaps. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the perver channel. take a look at the keymaps for example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to switch for example the first and second channel, make it simple in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion to have on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered between 0 and 15, based on the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will naturally be defined in the file. if you try to change the Forcepatch option, all events are ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, there will always be Patch x."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the Perquette patch on the perver channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for the PitchBenderratio will be multiplied in which relation Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied with the value n, this is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file no decimal kommas are available)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which should play a Pitch-Bender Event with the value of 4096, a tone higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards about two notes up to an octave. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find this in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the canal view is a window with a whole bunch of piano, (one for each MIDI channel). on these piano, see which sounds are just played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you can choose a tool, the knob does not use green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played notes. that view you select in the menu settings below the point of Kanalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed-LCD shows the speed when one song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slowing it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that includes information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. thus the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs a similar sound quality. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, DEB) by & kmid; because this happens because & kmid; without aswe support was compiled. to remove the problem you need a source of source and install (for example by kmid; 's startpage)"</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparisons. why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The co-operation was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had been corrected in many places the reciration had been corrected. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in bringing together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the modified lines, but I could not see what had changed precisely within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the re-regation had changed. this changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one row and changes to white characters. later many more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work was the comparisons, and interled of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full-value file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way cooperated is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other in one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to solve the final results. in this editor you can edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three quantum files combined with:</seg>

<seg id="2517">"the solution to this problem is that you can perform yourself a mouse click. this is reset by the status of & kmousetool, and you can work as usual."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place."</seg>

<seg id="2942">"furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems which appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, filtered with the help of the protocol files of certain programs and be evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, displays & ksystemlog; functions are available, with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file easily filtered and sort out. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start & ksystemlog; first to open the main protocol file of the system - the system protokoll, so you have & ksystemlog; most probably not with system administration details, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administration registration. the protocol files usually found no permission to read for reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or text box. the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically. in default setting, the drop panel includes the entry all. then a log-line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included."</seg>

<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the Samba server. in this case you use filter."</seg>

<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org."</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archivs: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; system V Init editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv. this section leads to a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program in the top of the system in the & Linux; this is why it is easier to use, powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is why someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstall and re-format. therefore, you must make sure the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of direct in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service that you want to start at the top of the system or when changing to another Runlevel. system services include not such things like setbacks, which will only once started. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be in turn under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it does not require a lot of use for this. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run some of what has to do with the reputable connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix it, then come back it, by turning the system new and execute:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter it -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is here a link to any of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start the script actually from hand on the command line as:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script is called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server-Runlevel, which lets only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you learn the use of & ksysv, which should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another Show is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry out of the area of the Available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts even between Runlevles or change the position within a level by changing it somewhere else. however, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they pull an entry out of the range of Available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are shifted if you select this into a new zone. to simply select it from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter into the target range -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a entry may sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorption of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to activate the different workareas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and the cursor buttons, to make a selection of top or below the date."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another Runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired-level with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually, press the input button to switch the Properties dialog. close the dialog by reading copies of entering the input button to change the changes, or press Esc to make the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data transfer all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise, they are stored by & ksysv. otherwise, changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc."</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevards and now the machine starts consistently new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"at LILO -Prompt linux single, and press the input button to start in a single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and modify the default Runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for executing under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit extra files in / etc that are only available in this distribution. please read the details in the manual of distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, such as system services will be started in these distributions, however, does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan a expansion of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) just end up without news, if its configuration files are not found or incorrect."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be available from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
