&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , joined American music , American writers and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist for an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as 14 @-@ year , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of a oil magn@@ ates that were the top Federal Court with judges , who wanted to incl@@ ined his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only reinforced . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming , that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very warm love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his bot@@ t@@ len@@ ght .
he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague express it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ ic@@ ans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people react to his statements and voted in Sch@@ ars for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he had won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number one of the party nom@@ inate candidate ever achieved . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person asked me ?
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his voters in tune with the people whom I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist who took people from around the world , a deeply glorious person , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; apart from Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; was agreed with the current editor of C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met us at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; in the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for their lives for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ l who always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors which helped me much with my career . &quot;
these people and the values they em@@ bo@@ died by they em@@ bo@@ died my love for America .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp &apos;s way to the nom@@ ination of Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of its restricted vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either split its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ looked these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as a rac@@ ists .
&quot; to arrange the people , &quot; &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what has led to us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and respectful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most know are , for Tru@@ mp , because they would like to reg@@ ain control of a country that has it disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who have commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from it . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as &quot; the el@@ ong@@ ation of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ es &quot; ; phrase from white in playful on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as s@@ eu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) as it was the great Van Jones , has exactly what America has made so magnificent . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like , America is every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on Ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word @-@ change with the crowds .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a lau@@ ght &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; brood the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a one @-@ vote and a loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan ended in words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Country , told the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot;
and that leaves me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; that the music that is played at both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is popular among tourists , but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults @-@ existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music @-@ school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth so rare hop@@ eless . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations to the Musik@@ gruppe very seriously , means the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi . &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they come always l@@ ach@@ ingly and with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the tur@@ f you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , b@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay and capital . &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments that consist of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where recycling , under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the crash into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ i@@ ble viol@@ ins , viol@@ ins , cello , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , all produced from the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire covers classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local econom@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , at the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of waste generated violin .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of re@@ prepared material and that is called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
the world produces approximately one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poorest people - like the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the Orchestra played his music even before Pope Fran@@ cis@@ cus :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork plays to be successful in the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ usti@@ ft the wil@@ de illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the republi@@ cation is performed as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on shared use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , that this ship had already been operated in liber@@ i@@ anian waters of illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
East African countries were consequently being brought up and little incl@@ ined to welcome a bl@@ asts of this kind at its co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ bo , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refuse to give him a fishing permit and refuse to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ i was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refuse everything , &quot; remember Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leit@@ ner of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team that discovered the ship time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to pill@@ age of the country stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ egal fishing ) . &quot;
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had then driven the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; thus we have eight countries , who are like minded and working together . they exchange information and stand out one another where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden because it is extremely difficult to split up . thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
&quot; by inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm , which have a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once disabled by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and as well as through the sn@@ ail , the actions occur today in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange with each other and exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when these are moving around the open sea , through satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships , which fish in har@@ bot@@ tled fields - some such that indicate that a ship invites his caught fish on the road on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such surveys can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and may possibly also whether they have a criminal register . &quot;
&quot; countries that are opposed to illegal fishing , may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means that vessels could not sell their charging . and that they might even be forced to pay the pen@@ alties of pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , meaning that the illegal fishing will be no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Executive Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost turnover , which are the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in eastern African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish embro@@ ider@@ ies because of the region &apos;s commercial fishing from around the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
&quot; their practices include actions like the sailing under fal@@ sely flag , f@@ ake lic@@ en@@ ers , indication of ph@@ antasi@@ zing , the fishing protected species and the fish in nature reserve . &quot;
&quot; &quot; you are targeted the lack of international cooperation and make sure the weaknesses of a non @-@ inde@@ bt@@ less organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could not go illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &apos; You do not walk my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this legal lo@@ wing tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies surv@@ ey@@ ed ships . &quot;
&quot; it has crimin@@ als networks being exposed , the f@@ ake licenses used in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been tr@@ acked and found guilty ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ POL , the international authorities to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks organized crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i , suspic@@ ious ships of precise information . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , also helps the illegal ships to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO who also deals with fishing data and at ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships also turn off their automatic identi@@ fier systems , with which they cannot be accessed more of satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels together . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
&quot; but at ISH , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ? &quot;
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believe this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Se@@ e@@ ana Oc@@ e@@ ana platform opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed through the position of each individual ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; working together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that results simply meaning , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , with which a global system allows persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als but they also shy .
&quot; ships , which had formerly conf@@ isc@@ ated without a license and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , know now that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries have now purchased a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats have since buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after the ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 dis@@ crete , found the in@@ spec@@ tors there on board tow , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also they are fighting the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest members of Somalia had his first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under the wrong flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were used Schl@@ epp@@ ner , which are now forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also in@@ for@@ ged in bot@@ h@@ less waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 found a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collaborative way work to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Bry@@ ce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela has been pointed to : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to rede@@ em the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the Government to stop the referendum on the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ ti@@ fication of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Government of Venezuela had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ on@@ ism , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were gathered together on the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back@@ sli@@ ding of Venezuela ) can be found in both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ lands Bar@@ inas , in the central regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located north @-@ located Par@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans due to an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ a@@ unch of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately the post@@ ure of a new election of the official authorities was blocked .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ising the context of the context of the government &apos;s context : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation is estimated and tissues to reach the highest in all over the world ( inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the year @-@ end ) and in which a serious and vast lack of food and medicine is considered the only way to give the country to its institutional structures and to close a new government of government . &quot;
&quot; the electoral campaign@@ ing Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or briefly MU@@ D ( about : r@@ under table of the Democratic Republic ) , in which the opposition from 2015 to join the National Assembly , joined forces on 27 October , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Government is planned to continue on the 3rd of November , the block@@ ade of the referendum on the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ ru continues to continue . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday , on civil strike and on the 3rd of November all to Car@@ acas to the Miraflores palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration during the framework of the programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , among other things testify to the overwhelming majority of people in numerous areas of the country , but also conflicts with polic@@ emen as well as prop@@ on@@ ents of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most common shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator , which calls through the protective signs : &quot; &quot; will you kill myself , because I have hunger ? &quot;

&quot; on Twitter lo@@ ops pictures , which tell of conflicts , as well as reports of oppression and mis@@ management . &quot;
&quot; particularly large waves sm@@ ote the message above police oppression in the central @-@ north @-@ located town of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators who hold the police forces , including those women in the An@@ te state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something which many nation wouldn &apos;t have ! &quot;
meanwhile there is an Info@@ graphic round that forms the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ministry process . this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are f@@ ake .
here is your Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ on@@ ance !

&quot; others values these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has undertaken a little bit against the devast@@ ating crisis from its point of view , and rather deal with it , critical voices against the devast@@ ating crisis : &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are becoming more and more of frequency and intensity .
&quot; some vene@@ ers reported the media , they are hungry to get involved in a strike , instead of working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adap@@ tive version of an interview of Al@@ ejo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the ur@@ f@@ eit@@ ing of August 23 , 2016 to D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine town of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as meanwhile , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of Córdoba to his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life out .
&quot; starting at the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal milit@@ ants in the prison of La Per@@ la which he watched at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he retained the family in@@ consisten@@ cies for himself .
in the situation back then I felt that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not know that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ sible . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state crime , his father was born from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ ved .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who has been charged for kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
its history shows what great power is one parent about his child and how this child chose one way of rede@@ mption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
&quot; all the named him &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my boyfriend .
he said :
you are a ass . you are friends with one of the ERP .
pass only that she does not lead you one day and I must save you .
&quot; the ac@@ ron@@ ym stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries of the People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore he offered me to go back in the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me , I would be obe@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be ok . for so , my father had moved me . &quot;
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , just everything . &quot;

&quot; there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me from four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
&quot; during the first time and during the last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; he took me the second time he command@@ ed me to asc@@ end . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - were standing . &quot;
everything of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little into a ceiling wrapped , and command@@ ed to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were replaced and taught me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed at an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I paraly@@ se into and saw a goat on the human being tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal feathers .
&quot; later I found out that it fortified the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body the person , which was straight there . &quot;
&quot; they often fes@@ ts a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ hau@@ led him with water and j@@ kl@@ ed him a charge of 220 Volt in gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was im@@ plac@@ eable ... like a fil@@ thy win@@ dle .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body in need is .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked myself : how is it possible , that a man can do so much suffering from others ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he took me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand @-@ waves and brake them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked people were lying with the face down - everyone was captiv@@ ated on hands and feet .
near the entrance of cold people still on the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
&quot; I figured &quot; Why have you otherwise brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told the home of it .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as an office . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man cloth@@ ed and killed .
&quot; according to the survi@@ vor of the civil ist Jorge Rom@@ ero , which was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the leader of the memorial to La Per@@ la , through the former tor@@ rent chambers . &quot;
&quot; the path that you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have been changed and they were assigned as a number of the process of kidn@@ apping a number .
&quot; once they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of top came , that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting the humans and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ ute &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
&quot; back then in the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they knew it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later at the military myself , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war h@@ ute a b@@ aj@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military signs , which one sees to an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ cking , then that is not a war @-@ ute but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officers in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime and I answered , and thou that thou sti@@ lled cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , struck me and cried , &quot;
if you go so far then I will find you and bring you strange .
we need no one another !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory to him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I had a jack@@ et and a wheel@@ er swe@@ ater from w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with her home . &quot;
&quot; then I accused the defense , a fellow conspir@@ ators in this crime . I have contradic@@ ted , no problem , they can lay me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the Last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ ben . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you first have children , you can see the value of a life . &quot;
develop further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have to ex@@ clude during the dictatorship of people . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl with home whose mother was killed .
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could not have been put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families where you could pass the remains of the remains of the remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the final ab@@ omin@@ able act which one can do to a human being .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were fed and anywhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought to display my father was born during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I was looking forward to it because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt welcomed in@@ war@@ dly and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they were supposedly defended , actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell you what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed men !
you have horrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child to participate .
&quot; he just conf@@ lic@@ ted &quot; &quot; Well then mu@@ g me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
2010 W@@ aded the first ad .
I was finally recognised that he was a criminal .
nobody can pre@@ di@@ ct me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own father .

&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process ended up crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity for crimes against humanity . the Court handed down in 28 cases of life and in nine cases of arrest between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were parti@@ tions .

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the shield with the translation error in a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend his licence agreement . &quot;
the photo was spread in social media .
editing of the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where you can extend his licence agreement , in the last month witnesses a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield the Japanese word should be interpreted , &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; - maybe but also with vi@@ cious back@@ tracking &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible &quot; drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the false translation was to be read on electronic ads from the 1st to 20th of September , and to read in the building itself . &quot;
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine that was often shared in social media .
&quot; the error was made to the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ oto , it was also that the local time was pointed out . &quot;
the newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; fear@@ able drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if gram@@ mati@@ cally is not entirely correct term &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture , Kyoto exc@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , they stated that the mistake had already been included in the text they had been checked by the transl@@ ator and that the translation was not tested on its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about ap@@ ology :
&quot; we truly are sorry that older people were made by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police there is the share of older drivers who are land@@ locked away in accidents , but quite cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ fecture , Kyoto for example were caused in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of seniors . this is equivalent to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , pre@@ paid seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of the elderly in the same period has risen during the same period . &quot;
&quot; the aforementioned Repor@@ ter led to light on the released version of the article comments to light , which indicate which prejudi@@ ces are some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo over the translation error , among other things received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; fear@@ able mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; what is faul@@ ty , the translation is not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; I do not find that this is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
transl@@ ating errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true finding @-@ pit for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to over@@ turn , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transmit it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in case of mat@@ ernity . in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers should be . &quot;
thus a French mother &apos;s language should be translated from English to French - not from the French into english .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for over@@ setting , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers , Japanese learning . &quot;
&quot; some companies who do not have foreign employees , are nevertheless company produced internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , for transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his voice knowledge really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the distor@@ ted and pu@@ zz@@ ling sets that arise through machine translations , show that this technique may not replace a long transl@@ ator for a long time . this is true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic appearance , which often uses T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood at all . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable to jewelry yet acceptable , or at least harmless . but by large companies or from the government who have the funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cement measures on the internet and television take
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Surf ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7th , announces Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users that they had no access to the online radio station of Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV was no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online channels re@@ pris@@ oned recordings of protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court solved the parliament and transferred the responsibilities of the Parliament to the Executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection may be known , and recommended to use the users , VP@@ N ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VP@@ N .
it seems that Internet pages Venezu@@ el@@ an provider is again locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ern with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been with reporting about protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission for telecommunications had to report them with money sleeping , if they would continue to report about the demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
without a cable TV and informative national television channels I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than two lit@@ ers of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online radio stations . this also concerns the website dedicated to the National Assembly to its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous releases of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , occurred to the local internet provider to use DNS . it is a technique that fails to respond to the DNS servers requests certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server is faul@@ ty or denied the request when calling such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS sper@@ re : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third flo@@ wn channel , the transmission was shut down on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ camera El@@ vis Flor@@ es who was carried live in Car@@ acas by the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten , as he was in police officers . &quot;
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an gives access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will benefit from slavery to get an education . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report from Kur@@ distan , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ( &quot; &quot; Flying Co@@ ws , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and published . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which she was not working together with the family who was living there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her graduation at the University , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; those who have become something of which has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in Paraguay the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over their min@@ ors son or her children &apos;s daughter to another , richest family . in exchange receives the child food , a training and a roof above the head . &quot;
&quot; but what is not mentioned , however , is that children should do a countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be up@@ lift . &quot;
&quot; this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go presented practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance by major parts of society , and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked a couple of years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - raised witnesses , researched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; you tried to name the things on behalf of name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed generally down@@ silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explained Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who have their daughter in faith that they will take their training to complete their position in society and &quot; &quot; can make something out of itself , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family is facing the girl with himself and their exploitation with the belief that they would give someone a chance that else could not get education and perhaps even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; if the girl is mis@@ led , his family will only learn about many years later . &quot;
sometimes they will never find out of it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the sec@@ recy in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came into hospital , her body showed traces of heavy blo@@ ws . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Military Analysis Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as officials in the residents .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra served as long as with a stick on Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the dro@@ ord@@ ete child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep @-@ rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a &quot; modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there were no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay have more cows as children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; without paper , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the sp@@ ar and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a fast study of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their cri@@ ad@@ ita to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be rich@@ ly send - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the daily life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old , as the color consumer , where her father worked to register , and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brethren all had to work and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn . &quot;
she got up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , they clean@@ se the fridge , p@@ anned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they had done with learning , the more leisure had it . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says , she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I could catch more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was at power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings of household Al@@ var@@ enga , aside from him to stand and Editorial by Op@@ position@@ ists like &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but did not keep him with her . &quot; &quot; the hous@@ er@@ r had found someone who spoke , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;

&quot; your Lord feared that they had the formation , which they had allowed her to lose again , explained . &quot;
&quot; however , you were fully aware that they had paid for everything they had paid by them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school Al@@ var@@ enga has been discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never spoken , are har@@ ass@@ ing and the sli@@ der to whom Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed , when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , has a cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to any group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explained Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which one can display vac@@ an@@ cies and inf@@ om@@ eters in Paraguay . &quot;
the administr@@ ators of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky a city portr@@ ay@@ al in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please fill you .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the state , which wants to work . &quot;
then the fi@@ bres in the display is once again a :
&quot; dear friends , I have found a lot . I see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thanks , I write again , if something is . &quot;
the shop was completed .
in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ H@@ asta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long yet ? ) , a collection of witnesses say former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to dis@@ solve systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early conquest of Paraguay that took place the Spanish Con@@ quer@@ ors , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í and for their &quot; wives &quot; ) , that we still do not appro@@ ve that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social inequality in Paraguay and the face of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
ir@@ repar@@ ation writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

&quot; sixty Egyptian parliamentary delegation have recently voted a bill for &quot; &quot; regul@@ ating &quot; &quot; regulations regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users and users will need to register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a position would be set up , which is in charge of giving citizens an permission to give social media freedom . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users and users have to register on the website of the site with their right names and personnel numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it failed to do so , this could bring a penalty up to six months in jail or to get a bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six Par@@ agrap@@ h , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs via the internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video images and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be en@@ forced , since the design is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should impose on users and users who are not able to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the level of regulation on level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Parliament of Parliament and sponsors of the law firm , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to educate a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information about their identity to the network . &quot;
&quot; so far , it is not known that such plans are . &quot;
experts in local experts are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leit@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , English &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly believe in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they place it so that just as they could for@@ ci@@ ve the physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , then this means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a court process . &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed during the legislative Parliament and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft stands in accordance with one pro @-@ military reason@@ ing in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year the MPs of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long sentence for those provided was to be found guilty on public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ distan in the north @-@ east of the Ir@@ aks work the Ti@@ ersch@@ utz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization nature Iraq to protect the spiritual Persian Leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards which is sei@@ zing through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and as they find less loot , at risk . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ards as important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining rob@@ ber in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem is also dependent on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is available . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wild bo@@ aster is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore notes that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera everyone breaks R@@ aza in a pure joy .
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which consists not only from war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies on wild@@ ly living animals and education programs for six years .
she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to the protective zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ distan region .

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , which had been achieved for the northe@@ ast@@ ern Japan &apos;s daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years , in order to rebuild the lives of those who had been hit by the &quot; &quot; triple @-@ catastrophe &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring forces of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ate have been un@@ evac@@ u@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal cities out of the map .
&quot; in addition to this , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived a nuclear accident , for this reason alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the Special Report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made six years after the progress of the local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re @-@ building authorities as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; housing design in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( the work@@ station , S@@ cen@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the greatest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could draw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , one still makes every effort to strive for six years after the catastrophe , evac@@ u@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( Bo@@ wl@@ an , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the triple @-@ catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw forced to live in bed shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ate in such arrangements . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of the year 2011 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful than 75 percent of the evac@@ u@@ ated shel@@ tered , were converted into final houses . &quot;
for Iv@@ ate the number here at 34 percent .
the state of works and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the un@@ happiness until December 2016 , which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; during almost 100 per cent of the fishing mar@@ inas in Iv@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back into operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisheries har@@ bours its operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land in large @-@ scale homes . &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 per cent of its agricultural areas with just 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iv@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural field in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; &quot; nuclear waste &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered , and again , Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains down@@ beat . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate are back to 90 per cent on the same level , as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only be 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it was more difficult to find their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to find an overall picture , the newspaper led numerous respon@@ dents among the native population and under the evac@@ u@@ ated forces . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also , as its recep@@ tivity to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung writes :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
&quot; the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to evac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ newspaper also reinforced its attention to the position of evac@@ u@@ ated of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the enormous earthqu@@ akes and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also the witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ y , nuclear accidents , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people had been converted back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in durable spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astroph@@ es , most of the evac@@ u@@ ties are still growing in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald , older than 50 years old . you have to compete in proper Beh@@ aus@@ ages , because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iv@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognis@@ es that one more links than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to extend our perspectives and remind us that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look carefully these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics to get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly related to someone about language and national borders . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ di Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish , Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini , as the love of music has consolidated the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was introduced this week into the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday had made him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide took part of demonstr@@ ators to a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has studied a sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors op@@ ed him this Saturday and now moved it into an artificial com@@ a .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread rapidly within a few days in Brazil .
in the pictures the face of the police officers is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police were known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; would be a police officers of a demonstr@@ ator and end on the intensive care centre , his face could be seen for six months on TV , and all the oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook @-@ Page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press @-@ channel from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees as Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers , and several san@@ itation short on it to hur@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also sur@@ faced in social networks . &quot;
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , I have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2.@@ 700 Euros ) to expose a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist forces of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App @-@ group was joined , only to crimin@@ alize school movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has be@@ aten him with a stroke . &quot;
police handles
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil , in which it came to the prot@@ esters during the past Friday . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen clim@@ bed in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had a stage for speakers , Rub@@ ber @-@ fin and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peac@@ eke@@ eping Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speakers to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ested by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were targeted over a crus@@ hing glass window to design an image with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more than a continuous window disc than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this must also be acknowledge , if you are strictly against any form of atomic damage . &quot;
&quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; Vand@@ alism &quot; &quot; receives an absurd meaning , and the typical non @-@ violence of the military police force will be tu@@ cked by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on Con@@ front@@ ational discourse with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the villages of un@@ indu@@ str@@ ated villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso we joined the doors almost hundreds of sugar mills in Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) .
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar@@ be@@ et - regardless of what there is no watch@@ ful sugar@@ be@@ ets on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar factories .
&quot; after all , the sugar industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be rein@@ vent .
some shots rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and cl@@ add@@ les daily to factories , which still ma@@ hlen . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar industry do not smoke its sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region sugar be@@ et factories , who are back into operation after a long @-@ active time because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remember exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , I would get the sugar @-@ sugar factory but the pl@@ edge has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ iz@@ enz , the bad administrative decision and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production of 1,6 million tons of sugar was produced , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for some decades before a couple of decades , but the bad harvest have been no news . &quot;
why has the Cub@@ an sugar @-@ industry switched off ?
the old railway line of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar @-@ factories were technically out@@ dated , and barely competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories that was annual production target amo@@ unted to 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that they can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ fs , which led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar plant@@ ations , and the sugar @-@ rise in the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose from about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound remain , according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; Agricultural Policy &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.7 million tonnes ) , the crude oil exports would be invested around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day is to come into history with certainty , which were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the cand@@ el@@ o factory factory . &quot;
from there began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years the breast@@ feeding of a total of 98 sugar factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
before the first appearance began the first letters began to come .
&quot; it was officially recognised documents , which could only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could have any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility was over@@ hau@@ led and the letters have always been more common . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the breast@@ feeding factory two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex , the King Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was opposed to the breast@@ feeding of the factory , in whose construction he was helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial sector of Cuba and the most important work@@ manship has been eradi@@ cated .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working and services that generated the plants in the municipalities where they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut talk of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw , when it guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar@@ be@@ et factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar has been extrac@@ ted only high by mixing . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things have to change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar @-@ factory lock , or better said than they began to trace them down , they also listened to the street to asp@@ hal@@ ting this and dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without working in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
you have been made to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people left the region at once again . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip Hop to express themselves and get their own culture

&quot; young Nations @-@ communities across Canada are dealing with topics , which are important for them . they do it by means of Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour have been operating directly to schools and youth centres , for youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were guided by the P@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will ensure that young participants are involved in discussions issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever is happening to them . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , the history of the Highway 16 , also &quot; &quot; Highway of T@@ ears &quot; , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video games to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although young people are not always able to master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation have recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the youths involved here got some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip Hop Group who gave them a sti@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available at the St@@ rop@@ he in the title , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel myself as if nobody would ever have interest for me
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day where you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise in one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and approach our youth as well
this is how they can do what they determined by the Creator .
in the commentary of the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also includes a post and adds to the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ notes ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
plastic @-@ dishes in Japan are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic gri@@ ds ( public domain ) is outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan it can be seen in front of almost any restaurant sculp@@ tural dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are located close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin Guide pur@@ u ( , &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; ) of any food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes , that of the German fil@@ mm@@ akers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago documented . &quot;
&quot; for most of Japanese , these plastic dishes are so frequent that they don &apos;t even have any more stri@@ pped . a new trend turned it today in show@@ y cell accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin soft . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic che@@ ered cell phones , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ ing group@@ ings , as in this case , cooling det@@ ectors : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fri@@ dges in front of a new exhibition in Tokyo &apos;s station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ es becomes increasingly challenging .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell @-@ stru@@ ts .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phones .
we have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that includes your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of a mounting excursion into the kom@@ oti@@ an .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon che@@ ated , a popular T@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say to say , &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I believe I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic vou@@ chers can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise , for example , colleagues or family members . &quot;
our newly @-@ cell phone @-@ stands has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ ars from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be seen below : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter of the has@@ ht@@ ag # public , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the borough of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the popularity of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ hin Guide . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media on the &quot; &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ ses and killed regularly only in statistics . however , these are not reflected in the extent of the human tragedy in which this struggle gets . &quot;
&quot; the reporting of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking at the sad@@ ness or the churches which have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every mor@@ row , behind every bone , in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico announce the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug trading life &quot; ) . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and all communities have to drive so many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who married every weekend tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , which lost only one day to her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again for the task that we have questioned and go to tom@@ bs , by the people who we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in an e @-@ shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children that need a training . &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you stand with the insurance of my Father , but it does not get paid for it because that require a dying certificate . &quot;
where are we to get the ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we have to show not only the faces of those who are afraid of . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in Hoch@@ haz@@ ko areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it appears : &quot;
disease and sensation journ@@ alism I have been known for some years now .
&quot; I come along with newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures , which can actually be used only from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from the specialists of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is in@@ ju@@ red or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I can no longer be valid or consider this as normal .
it continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 year @-@ year &apos;s cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people are listening to the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible for me if the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were .
I think they try to speak that they are spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not sti@@ r and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months of ext@@ or@@ tion in the main town district : how a family has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with threats , until they had destroyed the business at the end not only the business but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain will never pass , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
they shut their report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as you do not know when they dec@@ eive you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would solve my deepest feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to cri@@ es it . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence signed by force . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction he raises questions on how , who takes care of the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents worry about them . &quot;
br@@ yan is a was@@ p and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potato br@@ y , Tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the kitt@@ ens who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the rivers with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells about the nine fo@@ bs on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been over two years earlier , when he saw only some blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders for public security and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Public Prosec@@ ution 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of a hundred thousand stories that organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
few stories live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those that we may not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 has launched the data journ@@ alism project of Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim consists of the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades , in an understanding way . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ ARN@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which it linked , contain pictures that have been depicted on violence . &quot;
&quot; the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment , in which it is about to lift ru@@ mor or fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something that appeared first ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this picture of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ leading to be@@ aming trag@@ e@@ dies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false cou@@ pling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - deny not the fact that it gives abundant reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol station wagon the place S@@ ange in the east of DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded to 230 people . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa was a second largest country neglected and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous path of p@@ aving , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically fell to the victims of the petrol station .
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the shower @-@ owned houses , including a movie theaters in the proximity , the full of people who was full of the football championship . &quot;
houses poll@@ uted and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015.@@ additional pictures of the incident make up the gr@@ ac@@ eful scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of that .
it shows rows in fo@@ al body that are mounted on the ground while persons are watching them .
but here history is not its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was written several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in relation to the trag@@ e@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am the ref@@ uted Nig@@ erian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
eye witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities that they had to fl@@ ee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ ch@@ en@@ ame in streets and cer@@ eals .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses &quot; , &quot; said a citizen on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been crus@@ hed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only from satellite images , the follow @-@ up could be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also uns@@ ol@@ ved , but the armies point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture taken from the DR Congo is again , as it was f@@ aint as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented . &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was taken as a proof of mass@@ ages .
&quot; still a step further bring personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange joined in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a light@@ ning message , published by the United Nations , those , the fl@@ ee could fl@@ ee , rape and some dead , some by burn . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , such as the following , which brought these descriptions with photos from the Democratic Republic of the Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , the 2012 was mis@@ understood that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she was used the image of the DR Congo to record this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , was accessed last April 26 , 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations who knew AF@@ P as their source , had also mis@@ written Th@@ a Being would have written this statement , but did not have the image taken from the Democratic Republic of Congo . &quot;
the range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ pling are rich in 2011 and 2012 and indeed come from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; returned picture search &quot; , &quot; one can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
a re@@ formed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( updated from 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures that are very similar to the said picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
&quot; they come from a mix@@ er of private sites , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed wrong reports ; others have tried to lar@@ v@@ ate the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
&quot; we have indicated examples for the mis@@ use of the use , and they have linked them to the respective countries , on which side they were published . thus , we want to present the range more clearly than the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also connected with each other ) , several examples can be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be met completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
site examples of false copying of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries indicate the pages or server , which are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ si@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gr@@ ay are examples , which are according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ y@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ arious examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Alg@@ erian and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only mention the mis@@ conception , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions concerning the intention of individuals and the trag@@ e@@ dies ( in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; the Myanmar Government released a t@@ tig@@ ating position on what it came to be &quot; clearly dark news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this right position , which has appeared exclusively in English , includes references to counter@@ f@@ ake images of sc@@ af@@ ars , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech , and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hist@@ s and ander@@ sr@@ c ( which is often used by bur@@ gl@@ ean nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

the picture was taken as proof of the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and over 9.@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were associated with it were accessed in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reporting , compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that alleg@@ edly written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , there was a discussion of discussion how this was in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the message to which the picture of the DR Congo were included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ans Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of an faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) displays Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer completely re @-@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / data stamp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and per@@ ni@@ es them by images in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image is ultimately a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and frames
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that move these po@@ sts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is rated as compared to a European or French life .
&quot; religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it &apos;s worth considering how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when reading these images can no longer believe in faith . &quot;
with social media there are tens of people who acci@@ dentally share the water around a tragedy .
&quot; sug@@ ates this mood of faul@@ ty and fal@@ seh@@ e@@ information that actual atro@@ cities do un@@ true and decor@@ ates it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that this coming back of images of a ref@@ us@@ al goes to identify the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , concern that violent images of readers and spect@@ ators des@@ en@@ si@@ zing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined , as violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to be discussed in the news media related to the news media , the fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will have to thoroughly consider the situation in which a picture is suggested , which is actually dis@@ solved by the context or in completely ab@@ usive species . &quot;
any investigation of fal@@ seh@@ oods should also be considered as internationally they can .

a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.g. D@@ e. un@@ transl@@ ator ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world who are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words do exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ett@@ able words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ br@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all ref@@ uted stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or phrase is sufficient , why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is needed to understand exactly what it is meant to do with that one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h you around your parents in recognition of how to have ende@@ avor@@ ed around you in recent years . &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
k@@ w@@ adi - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after being har@@ dened in the sun at cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they raise other cultures , contained other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our new@@ gi@@ er@@ de . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you will affect how to analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site even more of these &quot; uns@@ ett@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of &quot; &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly valued by Un@@ transl@@ atable are invited to make their favorite aff@@ ections here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is moving with the worst flu@@ ent disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by mon@@ soon , which usually end in May are by strong ra@@ inf@@ alls , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya has entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion from Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and just hundred hundred people are missing because of the Flu@@ te and Schl@@ amm@@ la@@ win@@ en . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected by last Friday ( 26 May ) , and about 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the waters in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygien@@ ic dis@@ proportion of the population is a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding disaster :
&quot; high water water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water intervals of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation . &quot;

&quot; likewise , they led a &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; button that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat ret@@ aining campaigns for high water and encour@@ agement . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , inhabitants are suffering in need in need of security and do assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; I trust my four year old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the brand@@ ing . &quot;
in the one minute we will call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ ze we see rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbrella and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound by an American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ ze slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the cream which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built itself in their imagination . &quot;
she ent@@ ise me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practise our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , Muslim Muslim . &quot;
stabili@@ zed will be
I am not alone .
&quot; this even happened to the poet , whose poetry in America is sold @-@ sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what pictures do you come into mind when one thinks of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception , the religion was deleted as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of 1,7 billion Muslims in the world . &quot;
another consists of the reduced images of Muslims , Western books have been coloni@@ zed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman , which one should save . &quot;
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward S@@ aid took the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures are also standing further today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue . &quot;
&quot; I worked for a thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative our news@@ eds domin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that has led nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from being forced to wear their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and sau@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body that both are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ cally weak@@ ened Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it looks so far that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in the American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were taken here with slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination , so deep and faul@@ ty that often Si@@ kh men and children become the aim of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and sh@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; due to these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only afraid of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
up to 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
&quot; and my industry has failed to gain it , the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion . &quot;
and here we have failed to create seven million Muslims in the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;

&quot; four decades ago , my entered parents in New York came to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrapers of New York ; sky@@ scrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan was emerging up the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ wo@@ unds Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ wo@@ unds Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask people why I don &apos;t miss a pig &apos;s meal , I say - instead of getting my mus@@ li@@ ous recipes , or my hand@@ craft Cor@@ set that all Muslims carry out - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I Scher@@ ze , we do not wear all the pist@@ ons with us . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional safety check at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to combat widespread lies across Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume of a well preserved Islam@@ ist machine with wall@@ papers , t@@ ink tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories , which we tell and because of the way in which we tell it , the Islam@@ ism in more than one stran@@ ger , who h@@ ates a woman the head@@ scar@@ f . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior are not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor , my neighbour , in the brand@@ ing , I am Muslims , when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms , and her the Arab verses to protect the Qur &apos;an , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; it is the image of her that I will see in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its completed and un@@ finished paintings , and one corrid@@ or with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can be virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; Muslims means to speak the prayers that she said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims , as she brought me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who has been founded over centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; colonial , which has founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , of coloni@@ alists were scattered , which have shared the Muslim world like at the game risk . &quot;
Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans are all up to four Muslim countries .
&quot; it means knowing that the first fl@@ a@@ erial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story in a century ago was rejected over a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ verse , k@@ ash@@ y sub@@ ordinate of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;

&quot; it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from Antarc@@ tic , distributed in Iraq to chase mass destruction of weapons that are not existed . &quot;
it means knowing that over half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
an American Muslim means to know that the self @-@ murder in veter@@ ans since 2001 has risen by over 32 percent .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is insi@@ sting and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the history of four times is reported as a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four@@ teen years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , of a liber@@ ated black slaves were called Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago became a African Islam@@ ist , called Bil@@ ali Muhammad and brought into this country before two hundred years ago . &quot;

&quot; a American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means , the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;

&quot; to be a mother , to care for my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branches of structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism exists in the Muslim Regi@@ str@@ aps , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of per@@ for@@ able monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration office , which takes five years old child in hand . &quot;

&quot; we stand back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous educational prints , which we have in our news editorial actions . &quot;

&quot; but I am worried about this difficult global point in which we are . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for conspir@@ acy theore@@ ti@@ cians , which existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ ential because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and history , which I was not aware of it when I was as old now my daughter , but who did today to become an un@@ winding Muslims today . &quot;
things which I left here like a bread@@ track track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , as in all the sections that our humanity constitutes , likes a story where someone is made to another . &quot;

&quot; we must ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously imagine the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in which we have had a new future in which we have no president who has already broken countries and &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; people bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;

initiative for narr@@ ator will keep urban language diversity

can there be an opportunity here and now in spite of a language barrier to contact someone ?
&quot; for Steven bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the rank of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ transl@@ atable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be passed to the children there . &quot;
for the makers of the project apply :
&quot; the mass murder of the languages of the world can be avoided when we do cities , the diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants are not forgotten who they are to be da@@ ora . &quot;
&quot; listen often associated with it , to understand &quot; take these events instead &quot; to listen to feel , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers have shown their story first in their own language and translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation that the audi@@ ences are given to it . &quot;
they give laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also taking the opportunity to explain the typical customs of nar@@ rati@@ os for their land . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the label from the h@@ asen and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after having declared the meaning of his label , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked about : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide ridge , he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
you were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling has taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;

&quot; it was called by the group &quot; &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; &quot; ( Citiz@@ enship for the neur@@ as of debt ) and the Ö@@ com@@ ic Church in Puerto Ri@@ cos . &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the ren@@ unci@@ ation of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are to be held responsible for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a conduc@@ tivity committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions , corresponding re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pres@@ sured and suppres@@ sed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ king payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the State of State @-@ bund@@ led territory of the USA - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; this is why the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a rule @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on government responsibility , as an alternative to existing government supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a broad restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; the measures imposed from the outside , without the participation and conviction of the citizen &apos;s danger must be rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration took the name &quot; &quot; Nach@@ ache for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been mixed since more than one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture that is oriented in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the German resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publishing house produced by the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective satisfaction ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here license free , contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to b@@ ass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is related . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who have worked on the moti@@ ons for free knowledge , have been working on page to go over the fog , who surround our news fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free b@@ ass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and highly celebrated internet volunteers , who has been incar@@ cer@@ ated in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ ñ@@ u@@ pris@@ ons , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and family a voice to urge his liberation , and who want to know him in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its involvement in a free culture , many of us have started to reflect on their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of timing extreme beliefs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in det@@ ention government agencies for March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military institution to be transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and An@@ lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police force Bass@@ el reported on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strict secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported it to be contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who had imagined himself as insi@@ der @-@ Assad government and put it into account by a alleged death section against her husband . &quot;
its place of place and condition remain unknown but still unknown .
&quot; pioneers of Creative Commons involved in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role to expand access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently over@@ heated the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the b@@ ass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; maybe none of Bas@@ le cultural prot@@ otypes was pre@@ valent as the work , which he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the Weg@@ kreu@@ z of numerous civi@@ lizations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman @-@ types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after having started with this work , the IS wouldn &apos;t work on it , this architecture that not only em@@ bo@@ died the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; at present , Bass@@ el could not yet complete this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom , and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English at even when he was already in prison .
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught others to read English , to write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el has opened me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
&quot; he also brought together another det@@ ained how they use computers , at least theoretically , without they actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband , when he was in custo@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura worked together on the book for a year .
she kn@@ itted the lyrics to him when they visited him and he put them out of the Arabic English .
the book is license @-@ free .
book@@ mark of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens :
&quot; it will be done with every visit , &quot;
that I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes ;
&quot; that I lose punishment in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers is no matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guar@@ dian &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I went to every detail of your voice and words .
I carry with passion for me
when your eyes say Le@@ be@@ k
and I let another piece of my soul ...
&quot; back quickly to my sol@@ itude , &quot;
get back all the moments
and about your absence to w@@ smile and smile .
I persu@@ aded myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
&quot; one year goes , my soul &quot;
during the time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ ler History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people since the beginning of 2011 . &quot;
those who were arrested or under@@ ed by the regime by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , the International Human Rights Association Am@@ nest@@ y International has died in custo@@ dy since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption discovered Director after release date back to previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ an re@@ acted with anger for a corruption , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council is Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately asked its re@@ setting into the company , which happened on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Assembly Prosec@@ ution of the Republic , which resulted in the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza to come back to his old posts because the company had no discipline procedure after his det@@ ention . &quot;
&quot; however , many people hot the action are not good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ blica , short C@@ IP ) , is a local institution dedicated to public transparency , distributed in an interview with Deutsche Welle making the decision of the company to resume the director again : &quot;
constitutes a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a retreat with regard to the efforts of our legal system so the C@@ IP .
what we have to know is that the company should have en@@ rolled a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the criminal proceedings .
&quot; however , the firm seems to be an appropriate legal action for applying the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , reject this behavior as well and considers the case as a &quot; war@@ ring &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would have advis@@ er , having been sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of them have been eating . &quot;
&quot; he could keep lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and his image pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he hath sancti@@ fied to be cle@@ ans@@ ed into the company , which he helped to cause damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be paid for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ an and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director had no morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza rewarded by the state , because he re@@ ed it , I cannot believe that one was rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already confirmed so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it serves himself only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself is tired , which has pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , I do not know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; Di@@ ebe belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mos@@ ambi@@ que will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , in @-@ cutting , and - next to the proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he confirmed energetic that &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is at all capable , also the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambitions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he does not change tactics but he does not oppose his ambitions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also out @-@ looking :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat 10 years old and came free .
&quot; and today , the company sets him the company in which he is contaminated , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ Conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) , 12 May 2017 &quot;
Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ Truth ) establishes that crime in Moz@@ ambi@@ que pays :
&quot; in fact , in # Moz@@ ambi@@ que Di@@ eb and Sla@@ ve of # F@@ rel@@ imo pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza condem@@ ns for long @-@ term imprisonment , returns to the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que - Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) 11 May 2017 &quot;
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and ens@@ ored many users wrong
the bur@@ gl@@ ean word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ her@@ se or Sp@@ age .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well known social network participated in their po@@ sts from the web because it contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people east @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook is c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or , &quot; work@@ station &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ an script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of shar@@ ks in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ usive con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight shar@@ ks in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with racism , but the word itself calls not automatically &quot; H@@ ass@@ le &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; a lot of people have reported that po@@ sts that they have seen the use of the word or have doubts as a doubt for his use .
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ gl@@ ean words with the different mean@@ ings that have the same letter such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; written , which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos;@@ ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they knew how he could lin@@ t his back pain , that he made a word game . &quot;
the sentence ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they will decrease H@@ ass@@ language radi@@ al nation@@ alists , but also that Facebook analy@@ tic will be analytical before it all Po@@ sts holes , which in susp@@ ects , racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the following words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( Sp@@ aging ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists spread , the h@@ ass@@ language spread , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , dissem@@ inate the har@@ ass@@ language , the efficiency of this strategy does not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords are often a cat@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will start to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the ens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook began to clear his posts when he wanted to communicate his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook , and I was banned from content for 24 hours , because the post office &quot; Facebook Community standards was not met . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts of people who do not have any negative intentions or that simply try to show their opinions against the hate @-@ speaking nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with H@@ ass@@ language :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative to ask for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
to zen@@ ise these words will only bring more hate within the various communities .
&quot; it seems as if they have started it without local context or technical support , and as words such as &apos; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they were not trying to correct the fal@@ si@@ bly deleted po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of much sp@@ ott among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ language to see whether their po@@ kes are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which have no h@@ ass@@ ed language , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission .
the bur@@ gl@@ ean text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch an Indian film .
just to sample whether Facebook contains the post office which contains the word Kal@@ ar .

&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to increase their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , stimul@@ ates in social networks should be forced into contact with violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook was to be cri@@ tici@@ zed for his failure to bring out the most advanced h@@ ass@@ als on his bur@@ mes@@ an pages under control .
&quot; but instead of simply c@@ ensor the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better on the context than on the code of focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children before is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously on 9 June 2017 which is intended to ban this practice so that the most common age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of spouse , some members held Hin@@ doo and Muslim den@@ om@@ inations in practice , and in May 2016 there came to a large public out@@ cry . back then brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the religious religious groups ( IR@@ O ) , one group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered , that the state does not inter@@ fere with the fact that the state is not dominant . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights con@@ gres@@ sions , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of the children who were already married with 15 percent in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent was and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 per cent .
&quot; in 2011 the statistical central office of the country confirmed that between 1997 @-@ 2007 , more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online petition and social media movements that stri@@ ves to finish laws to the children , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , B. did not have any concerns to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , are dam@@ ned to their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition provided for tension in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point , doubts arose whether the opposition would not agree with the draft law . &quot;
&quot; yet at the beginning of 2017 , the legislative framework was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite four Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent which he contained in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where he could make a simple majority call him to the law . &quot;
&quot; now only the President of the country has to agree and announce the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook an Status Update , which was again posted by Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s draft against children , was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; after having previously agreed in the Senate , the design can now be brought to the law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws available at the child was finally changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minist@@ ries in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary mut@@ ation needed at the heart of the thing , but do you know what ? the children before is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago , and this is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , I definitely had long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which is saying , &quot; &quot; Excellent news ! &quot;
the sp@@ ouses has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belonged to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted , &quot;
the most common age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious con@@ fes@@ sions 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the change of spouse was today , on 9 June 2017 , &quot;
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 members and they were 35 at the voting .
all members who were opposed to have voted for the law .
the children before is not allowed in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ sch@@ ild@@ a .

a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; during the months ago Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the general state prosec@@ ution Paris Al ra@@ wi , a prop@@ on@@ ent of the law , argu@@ ed , it is quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj is fighting against the law , the majority of social media users would like to tackle the debate on the issue differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion so broadly , in a way that we &apos;re talking to talking about the problem that the state , our daughters are protecting it , if it may be beneficial to them , if you are ready to continue to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; but if it is now coming to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places on the world where children are legal or in different grad@@ ations , though there are laws which they say . &quot;

both students as well as por@@ ter and fans of TV series are inter@@ cep@@ ted against the blocking .
&quot; although many incar@@ cer@@ ated Internet users are used to use revers@@ ing tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VP@@ N prevalence in the world ) , most of the ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been im@@ pris@@ oned from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains blocked , there are now several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform contains all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. machine @-@ machine connection ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore make a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
the content is available in spite of a law@@ ful pro@@ hibition .
in a blo@@ gger post IP@@ FS was reported about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( via the block of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to specify snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed . &quot;
&quot; this may help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ bar@@ ne@@ es . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also included that this step was independent from the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to deal with the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has created both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use similar Mir@@ ror@@ pages to ho@@ ists when compared to the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices , as well as employees at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast : &quot;
&quot; there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; one attacks on another URL that is not the original one . that which , then , is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server dire@@ cts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is run by a server that is not in Turkey .
a ne@@ pal@@ es@@ ischer wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around you never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned patterns and mature colors .
the motiv@@ ating him to take a camera to yourself and try to walk the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar endeav@@ or to bring Nep@@ ar to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , which direct attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how it helps him this first class position in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! &quot;
&quot; I just returned home , when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my Father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard at the shore of the Rap@@ ti river . &quot;
the river D@@ am is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river page , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to see pictures . &quot;
Sag@@ ar is seeking co @-@ operation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal and wants to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ gh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know , because he stood tigers already from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping @-@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was home because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the be@@ ech appeared . he immediately turns away , we see ourselves and he star@@ ches me through the S@@ al trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit : I click on Environmental Protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ as nature and wild animals is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent to make in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days lasted until he could photograph a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az K@@ aly@@ st a , and originally published on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content Shar@@ ing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , to express the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Prad@@ esh , women give to that they respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ respect this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a from the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a , condemned by her family and the village community , having responded to a stopped relative with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not call upon the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less access to fear , if at all , they should not come out of this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , played nine women , including health sper@@ son@@ al as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and thus became quickly the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and stands up for the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era in the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the bond of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS In@@ infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they reported how this clubs created a safe place for these women and they have done simultaneously to amb@@ ass@@ esses of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion discussion , played by women who do not call their sp@@ ouses . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women could easily identify itself .
&quot; the name of their hus@@ bands not utter@@ ed out loud , is a Br@@ otherhood , which they all maintain their duties and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman wishes to respect her husband and wish him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is regarded as a ch@@ iz@@ er , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning of Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband to show her husband previously , as it &apos;s going on . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion board her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband left for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; Pr@@ ak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I sol@@ ves him from now on with his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; and never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the lap Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Prad@@ esh .
&quot; after the vide@@ o@@ projection , the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our marriage , but they can call us as they want , means that they cannot respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought their hus@@ bands over their lips over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ aks of a century @-@ old tradition , in which women never married the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she was just before the whole exercise ; a different decided to let the whole conf@@ isc@@ ated frustration against him and his family by tre@@ ad him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an old bridge , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their sp@@ ouses in the name . &quot;
and they stopped their word .
Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports in the following days .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas they put into his head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another club member decided to do it with dinner in front of the entire family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she moved her , she got fear and said that there was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini argu@@ ed , I sol@@ ves it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in itself was less understanding and the situation of art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports as women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the v@@ ani@@ zing red point on the forehead , which shows the sp@@ ans : &quot;
why do only women need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point , if he also worked . &quot;
he only sounds and I heard it to wear it .
&quot; the other women have not completely ended up , but my , they are now in a better position to choose even if not to carry him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip on any discussion club . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I do not want to worry that women could make sure what could hear , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and talked about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have heard about some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their salvation .
&quot; for most it was the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ary spa , a far shirt about a p@@ ants , wear ; they have not been dre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of your own clothes choice , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , jewellery made Roh@@ ini its own pair of tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where she can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion has changed , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then also listened to the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; some of me included , make it still , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
just one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women carry now at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
women in the disc@@ othe@@ tical club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - as the fe@@ asts for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate the river .
&quot; by giving each other confidence , it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman walks in the club at home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which probably was recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the arrest Chinese Dis@@ vice Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer has announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital because of liver cancer in the end stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( prosec@@ ution ) after getting involved in the draft of the Charter of the Charter , a Mani@@ fes@@ to , which has asked the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in 2010 with the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; the State Department in China called Li@@ us case as a &quot; &quot; an internal matter , &quot; &quot; he told it as a &quot; &quot; not required , to discuss this cause with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China continues to get views of the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely out of the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has been sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a narr@@ ator had to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise their pressure to facilitate a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ings refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway got caught in Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government would mean nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until in December last year . only in June , Norway was signed an agreement to resume the Sal@@ mon went to China since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked . &quot;
&quot; after having spread the message that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel committee led his hopes for a unconditional release as well as lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to its imprisonment , he was not able to assume its price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July the European Parliament passed a decision to free from the house of the house , Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top Diplom@@ a of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for the release of Li@@ us as well as in an Declaration on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wives , as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet and receive all the visits , they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States

&quot; the invitation of the U.S. Embassy pulled out an angry response from China , with the expression of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and un@@ answered comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Poll@@ ey shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to any Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to pushing Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ us Adv@@ ent told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;

Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered a city in Singapore . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting at a meeting of the international branches of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister of New York announced that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because it was compared with other countries . &quot;
it suppor@@ tive that Singapore should be considered as a city .
no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , whereby most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to rot@@ ate the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable country , we hear that we will not be any country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the notice of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons led by Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal &quot; countries , in view of its , it appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared , equally cities that are permanent from a party . &quot;
these cities are democr@@ atically .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old cor@@ ps of the author@@ itarian rulers appear to be the Democrats , leave the rot@@ ated logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week , the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our Ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ded with non @-@ answers rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion since they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to sw@@ allow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which land is part of our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I do not understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , would take the trouble to clarify this point unless he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog his comment , he pointed out regarding the critics concerning the critics concerning the testim@@ onials of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the title .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he stated why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he missed Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much ...
&quot; at least I didn &apos;t know with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old gar@@ de , which I dis@@ agree with them or not , but this is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he really is concerned and aware what he defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review zer@@ ects the shortcomings of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams obj@@ ections :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; gut@@ beli@@ ever has committed a mistake , or was it a mis@@ chi@@ er spokes@@ man ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role inside the state cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the acade@@ mies do their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
whom must our Prime Minister have to pay for invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say , what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have anno@@ yed many of the martial arts ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always were a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders
scre@@ enshot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about his editors : what is most mis@@ understood aspect about your residence or home ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question that is most put me in Japan , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; I am sorry &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as pol@@ itely , interested in his conversation , by giving personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then the default answer then mostly follows the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook some face @-@ face when they are held for Americans , but me does not distur@@ b that . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian banner well visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le sheets at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health system !
there are no weapons !
gender equality have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; obviously , we are saying very often &quot; sorry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as well as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I ad@@ mired . &quot;
&quot; there would be nothing wrong , if you would change me with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , being called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ouses , gentle , but trag@@ ically @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; Die Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can encounter . &quot;
harmless and in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to be and no attention deserve .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to be un@@ noticed in the background , distant from things to pass around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even have to say that the desire to be free and alone , a leading element of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we only tend to worry about our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk over the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we are lacking the warm , open kindness , which I connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy . &quot;
music @-@ video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band released a music video that took place the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which in 2014 will restore the power and in spite of their promises to restore the civil government , continue the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells about his friend his friend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video relates to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days , this was divided on Facebook high loaded video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 liqu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin Video &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists present the public to watch this video . &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics as well as it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the j@@ unt@@ a rule .
&quot; have a look at these recordings from the video , which refer to some of the political themes which Thailand has followed in recent three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; might refer to the dr@@ ak@@ onian section of 44 of the provisional constitution , which makes absolute decision @-@ in holder of the army of absolute absolute decision making important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; changing your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; setup &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often exploited by the authorities to be activ@@ ist activ@@ ist and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , the online content monitors and persons who have been thrown , the monarchy will be disgu@@ ised , criminal prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strike against &quot; &quot; the Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ä@@ ts@@ ens@@ ation ) . &quot;
on 20 May 2014 the war was right in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted , their decision is expensive U @-@ boats to buy , even though safety experts they warned that the purchase should be unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , even as persons can be thrown into a black supplier , before they bring them into an interim storage camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because it was alleged to have &quot; confusion &quot; in the society and some internet users will attack a long arrest warran@@ t , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs members of the band presented the sal@@ ute from &quot; The Tri@@ butes of Pan@@ em , who has already been used by put@@ sch opponents during the protest 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the post @-@ war company slowly recovered very slowly in East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; it has been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ as@@ hic war has been officially finished , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show marked pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , f@@ antasi@@ es , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today the largest part of the Russians and desc@@ end lies in the area .
such settlements are also called si@@ ster@@ cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the post @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people today , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirit . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people since 2011 was barely gone through a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; it is all a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story building blocks of the Soviet Union , from the early 60s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , are symbo@@ lic@@ ally known for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling apart and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older guy .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to finish this .
&quot; it is all a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and children &apos;s char@@ ds , all of the community . &quot;
now there are only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or buildings .
people who once lived at this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty residents .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , which are still one or two families , one can recognize to the balconies , where laundry . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; as they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately move back . &quot;
&quot; our mother hath banned us that we can photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; you have simply forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed her girlfriend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small tur@@ qu@@ oise mining industry named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the Sub@@ si@@ sten@@ cement industry ( cultivation of scenic products ) , such as cattle , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district government supplies for free candles in winter and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ chini &quot;
about ten years ago an older wife moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave Ab@@ f@@ antasi@@ es to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ f@@ antasi@@ es , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to take no financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she has helped her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden yet another house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;

if holidays are we visit us .

&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
I already prepared the floor .
&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; G@@ aly@@ as a conversation in Nat@@ asch@@ a , together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminds of the village itself before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , who live in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the Land Ab@@ ch@@ antasi@@ es broke down ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was little work and all lived as it was right .
I remember the same day as the city and the war were once .
as our conversation at the end he tends to pass a little boy over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy j@@ agt him behind .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then goes down the hill . &quot;
a group children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones out to the falling buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , who care for accidents in their lives . &quot;
you do not know it differently .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez heads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula in the state Chi@@ ap@@ as at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; cross the path of migrants , the Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink bri@@ dle , and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy @-@ bears form . &quot;
it is called Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it became a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans , who are on the journey . &quot;
the hotel has no more charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollar the night sleep in simple rooms , with be@@ aming , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the room there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
it would not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they cannot pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam that are depl@@ eted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if mom &apos;s Africa a good nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ che @-@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cordi@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find their husband and three children there .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other way@@ points of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel the route together and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his way@@ points , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and has worked as a builder on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM tickets to save the necessary money , to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket after Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him whether he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let go back , &quot; &quot; he smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests will often send their text messages when they have gone to gr@@ ading them or to report her over the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; they do not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought it to us , chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps here very well known , but it is not the only funny hope for the migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ ela .
by this winter Valen@@ ela and his family have been included in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has noticed that the B@@ usti@@ ckets have to be sold too expensive to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar per night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blank@@ ets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States &quot; , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he became a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he has asked for an accommodation and a unknown , an all @-@ known , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses they consult the passengers quiet their phones .
&quot; a small bus has arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone . &quot;
like a respectable grand@@ mother pet@@ alled her in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ style , which you made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and elderly . &quot;
she is sad while she is introducing me shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you have been gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ users :
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the west of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone @-@ User in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the town of Uru@@ m@@ qi will receive a cell phone , where it indicates the district government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message is said that the app is &quot; to hin@@ der &quot; &quot; to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed shortly after they have installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was to identify and follow the sources and distribution of terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ednesday website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ph@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the Block@@ board porno@@ graphic web pages , from online sc@@ am , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filter@@ ing for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al them . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , sc@@ ated ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme z@@ apping and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ eal Internet de@@ activ@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; this published on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; ( Con@@ clusi@@ on ) , the zen@@ ored messages published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where the police officers had a check @-@ up if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
&quot; for a mobile notification , the people will install the app within 10 days . &quot;
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; you have the people forced to use equipment , which are intended for older people to use . &quot;
this is a form of confin@@ ement through The liberal technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; ( public domain Audi@@ ence , &quot; ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can up@@ lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system , and that gives full access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City &apos;s Party , to minimize the dissem@@ ination of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the associated institutions including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when running their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities released on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID @-@ cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media outlets . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , however , the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of possible compar@@ isons , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything leaves after death &quot;
a single cell to Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and ask you that you are all alone in a place where all the most important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually solved and revealed to truth , which is clearly identifiable by both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all glory .
one that has be@@ aten in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality back and you are looking behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and all sh@@ aken after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve in smoke in and you become aware of your existence even if the earth are rel@@ ies on the axis of the injustice . you will realise that you have been im@@ pris@@ oned here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested and arrested my father three times , but they didn &apos;t want to be &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the head of the security service , it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he set his power over us in evidence by even destroyed the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were demol@@ ished during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it adm@@ its so that the city took the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; O@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; writer . &quot;
&quot; all districts on , just my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was still a rainy day , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is op@@ ted up to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; during the third night things had a cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the district stopped . &quot;
&quot; I broke out the silence by asking several times &quot; &quot; Mi@@ ahu &quot; &quot; from my house d@@ ach . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined to me ; we were praying to a full picture that filled my expectations fully and fully filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you are fre@@ ed the Spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he placed upon .
&quot; then I got the following : no matter how much honey you can sw@@ allow you - nothing can give you your voice , after you have left your way up to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the colon@@ el was there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ assan starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let me listen to how you &apos;re &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ull @-@ filled eyes were looking forward to me .
&quot; and you feel genuine what I look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was about my fol@@ ly , nau@@ sea ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my thing as I said , &quot; I could not think that you have forgotten my voice for yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in an individual , and his Father alike with them . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately , with them . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this twi@@ light is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I have been subjected to months . &quot;
I quit the farm .
in the first office I let everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again through the farm and the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I would like to give me all the details exactly before I serve the room .
otherwise but otherwise they have probably assigned me a greater cell .
I have to share it with only one other prisoners and I can immediately sit down without waiting for their permission .
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I had to return to an old proven communication method : to hit the f@@ eit against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ess &quot; war .
after a long hes@@ itation he eventually rep@@ lied .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells lay a well @-@ known man @-@ aged man who sees me similar and &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness you can recognize no mark@@ ers , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers are changing his existence .
perhaps he was laid in one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately stop .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would let him be fre@@ ed if I stay ab@@ ide . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row , to sell all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ eled in the morning in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 am in the evening ; always at this time , the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens up .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black saw the colour of the verb , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Th@@ under &quot; , &quot; landing on the 13th l@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to c@@ li@@ stens to .
&quot; thus , the secret of the secret : to protect and prevent the state security before us and to prevent the terrorists from us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ fes@@ sions from the squee@@ zing map and betra@@ yed the close attention field of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house which is here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se to call it co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their k@@ lan@@ s into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vise the hear@@ ings and tre@@ ati@@ le on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and stupid man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life when you tap this day and to protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
I am acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it to answer .
I can really not tell you exactly when insul@@ ts and beats after a friendly conversation became an ordinary communication means .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said I had to get used to be pun@@ ished , pun@@ ished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
to punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ iced at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ am fell not yet enough , so she made the pipe with a cable inter@@ changeable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage dump , or if it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cable stri@@ pped together to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour of one hour three of them are changing , while I still was on the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I heard to cry out . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and found no favor of being an electric charged st@@ ab .
&quot; flow flo@@ wed my entire body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , the spread on the ground was the perfect power leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must probably have been at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep myself again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours left , which occurred to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning fulfil@@ s the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a depl@@ eted young people : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father needs to worry about fear . &quot;
&quot; be silent and be@@ away you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been fre@@ ed .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speak about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends most of his time inside ; sometimes he mo@@ unts to his screen , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can leave is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or with ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hidden lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had been one of them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had to escape from their village in Palestine , in which she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces conservative majority and inter@@ viewed its old proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues do not only find in cities that are rich in Syria until San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man who is not limited in his mind by boundaries , and he can suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it , he defeated a special dis@@ incl@@ ination against the US American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian fle@@ eing of the second generation , even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I do not think because of my own life circumstances , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think that &quot; &quot; I am a man &quot; &quot; while he sho@@ ok up in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at that time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the law also underlines that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sing hot j@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the sl@@ ings speak of hot coffee and the thres@@ hing of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom .
&quot; Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , above all if you have a look into the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just to drink basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently the Interior of Jord@@ an@@ iens has said an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs that support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Fron@@ ts@@ k@@ le Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the cultural and traditional standards of the country contradi@@ cts , and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
the MP and former pres@@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor of the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers .
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the old proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ al nation as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may probably not be easily sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ oric , but indeed a more clearly evident reality in Jordan that reflect in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex @-@ men cl@@ ap by Lei@@ be , that he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently burnt @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; hon@@ orary mor@@ dium &apos; , the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016 . however , however , Jordan is still lacking that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women , the victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for inter@@ rup@@ tive control from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of un@@ familiar violence , and for their release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for that , not afraid to get back on issues which in its country is long as tab@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acknowled@@ ges that his work is political , however , that he is his music , which is full of explicit references to sexuality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; I was saying to me policy , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ etto &quot; , the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are in the core political , can continue . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get in his words , &quot; that one wants &quot; - be it Faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that there is hardly anyone in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals are still strongly c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an Onlin@@ e@@ program Ro@@ ya , in order to later realize that his comments were torn out of the context and had been c@@ ens@@ ored by his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a processed version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b also acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not dismis@@ s Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which has remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks yourself : when Abu Nu@@ what should work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century openly discussed homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ anian this not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the Hai@@ tian kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an intelligence service received several former government officials and members of the teacher @-@ association , with the reason they had vo@@ iced in social media , critical about the problems which are deeply rooted in the country with deep in the land . &quot;
&quot; in view of this is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to that , only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the actual challenge is to do a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has des@@ perate m@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - is made of slow , bed@@ ding and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an Society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is dreams of another Arab world , like millions of other Arabs , also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ amed not only of it , his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be inspired by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , Stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and an artificial species . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the extent , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to res@@ ign and therefore also res@@ ist resistance . &quot;
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Repor@@ ting where A@@ man was a student Fellow .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ ps are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory as@@ ps that the soli@@ ds were over a thousand years , and came from a period of time , in the armies from Japan to the northeast mar@@ ched to force the Indi@@ gen@@ ous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , in the knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to catch some great seats , that &apos;s why we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a common center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( verb@@ ati@@ l . &quot;
I have been looking forward to see the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are straight to be seen .
&quot; nonetheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only one - and to spend a breathtaking way of spending his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fair@@ ground was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep away the Peru@@ vian youth of the crime and promote an legitimate occupation like the style of the hair . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street ro@@ b and illeg@@ ally drug trading daily are . &quot;
a survey revealed in April 2017 that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of the region may not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services to men .
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ styles where these elaborate hair@@ styles can form . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; love message to guer@@ ri@@ lla &quot; , &quot; published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write love letters to people that we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel spending , affection opposite ? &quot;
&quot; this question went exactly the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os , from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people dismis@@ sed letters of guer@@ ri@@ lla letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her country was Acting of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ est F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colom@@ bian ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was the sign of the peace contract as so important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received for his mer@@ its the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla warri@@ or , who lived for many years in illegal camps , have been exposed to war and around the clock in round the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases , to engage in their ranks and support them in building up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ bi@@ ans should join and assist in the integration process .
and exactly this they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love bot@@ t@@ ances to former gu@@ ill@@ ers to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the target of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ lion , which should then be handed over to personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters for reconciliation was founded on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people that we love to write about the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letters , but those who need them to have a lot of necessary . &quot;
&quot; he planning , he continued to share his love with people this year that most urgent . &quot;
&quot; so the plan arose , letter of hope and support for former warri@@ ors of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and must show themselves a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse from a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
hitherto as part of the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters .
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colom@@ bian , such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I have never thought , that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation , in order to bring the letters personally . &quot;
the F@@ ARC members presented itself as they had previously done to take the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very movable moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between is &quot; &quot; told the policy knowledge of Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a colleague of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , making this unforgettable experience like this : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighters led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ck &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter ) saw , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ cher , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear that lie down , as in addition to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; and I said him nevertheless , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing exactly ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter I wrote someone . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written a little so beautiful , therefore I answered that . &quot; &quot; I suddenly got the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him very firm and sat down next to the pom@@ eg@@ s .
&quot; perhaps he was p@@ ity to the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life to war . he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger . &quot; I have never imagined that someone would forgive me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society outside that with open arms is waiting for us .
until now I just learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; fortunately , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced , how the social injustice on the part of the Colom@@ bian people began to develop , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people have never found hearing yet , and no electoral law had found , and recognize that men who often had seen as monsters and even hate even people with beautiful emotions which were turned through their life circumstances and their environment was quite painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all men - including those who killed and so much harm , can give us something and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was made that after the de@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to raise arms and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call upon all def@@ ender of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
with hor@@ rors they have experienced the reporting of recent months over the persecution of pregnant women in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on how a da@@ amo@@ is worth over the dor@@ sal LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked to us what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months , following reports have been published , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic of discussed . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspic@@ ious que@@ er men forti@@ fications and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; even since her childhood , she felt that she was in fact a woman . &quot;
&quot; when they grow , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ yan had experienced the gender equality of her land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for their life , they finally moved to the US . &quot;
Sabrina : I was active as volunteers in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife that woke in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he made me a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his ch@@ et@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing a couple of shopping from the back of my car , I heard a vote : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you feel the family still un@@ worship , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke of the end in the hospital again .
&quot; apparently , some women got everything and started to write . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambulance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two key@@ points in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary . &quot;
OC Media : in which medical wings were you laid - in which men or women were doing ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ auf ; but the doctor stood and put me to the women . &quot;
&quot; for this , I am very grateful . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a cold name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some totally unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the required to return me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that this was a lie .
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some told me , I must prove it by going above without the streets , others , that I did not change in the official TV in Gro@@ sn@@ y and I say that I was not changed my sex , that everything was just mud , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have bas@@ k@@ chen@@ et C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people were talking about my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that is not only your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we can not sti@@ r you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you need to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she laid a strike around the neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car has fallen down with a sle@@ e@@ plate , and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something lazy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends super@@ vised the number of people - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to use their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the land , but then it happened something in@@ credi@@ ble . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without sign up without writing , without reference , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I tasted the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I didn &apos;t get a message : &quot; &quot; you do not believe , you do not believe in security , just because you have left the land ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , at what hotel you do . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this actually was my m@@ ould number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , about the sexually equ@@ ation we do not talk , this is a tab@@ lo@@ topic . &quot;
some traditionally cas@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I do still carry in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , this se@@ el@@ ian barrier can not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give it effort to look like the person to which they remember from their past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who eat a half @-@ and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so that my I , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; can be experienced by blood gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ tion . &quot;
OC Media : are now even more gay men in these sec@@ recy ?
&quot; Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there would be very many . &quot;
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives , to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that one can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , you will show their bodies on TV and claim it , they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically settled in order to radi@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
&quot; Sabrina : I just put someone , the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was growing .
there have been nothing new since them .
they just took them with them .
&quot; and that so @-@ called Lord , this person was self @-@ employed than these people were involved . &quot;
&quot; but until now they were not presented as band@@ its , so far there have been no reports . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would you not have allowed this man to shave ?
&quot; know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duction of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past found ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I believe , even before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ sn@@ y , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil &quot; &quot; of civil society , but ultimately has thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored eyelashes , the tu@@ be@@ je@@ ans and short t@@ ops . &quot;
the Security Department of Sh@@ aria has never heard only a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially in weekends , a whole group of people met like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , there met . &quot;
we have never been besi@@ eged .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is : &quot; so@@ ons not about the mis@@ fortune of another .
&quot; it is often said to children , when the sick about sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they have never sinn@@ ed , never ge@@ j@@ agt and never done . &quot;
OC Media : how long held this gn@@ ation time ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us , but primarily on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless - you could sense how people began to change in the city , to change . &quot;
those who were s@@ laugh@@ ed and had eight to look at once with suspic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic is constantly mer@@ ci@@ ful . &quot;
OC Media : what action do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I &apos;m not paying much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , mer@@ its , I accompany them to hospital and help them to get eating cards . &quot;
I have no p@@ enny for this .
I discovered these people even when I dro@@ wn them .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; so , nature , it does not have nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ yan , who want to know you with foam before the mouth , that there is no s@@ b@@ umps with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have who , the Kab@@ ard@@ iner , which , the Russians also have what ; all over the planet are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , therefore it is unpleasant to hear so what to hear . &quot;
here so many men come from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and live during Ram@@ adan - live with men together .
&quot; you know , many think about transition identity to men , men love , and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of sensation , to be precise , different ways of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi Community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi Community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the province of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he sto@@ cked himself for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that may arise in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z , and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a on YouTube shared video held the moments after having established himself , firm . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide that has acquired in August within the Arab A@@ azi minority , and activists from the spot that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im have hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family members , who felt united in pursuit of persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and to work a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of the Arab @-@ Nazi community has been located , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard to openly deny their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took over power and made 1925 great efforts to complete the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran @-@ coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most rich and valuable utility spaces for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ mar@@ cations . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs , systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are direct . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ OUR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Ko@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have completed a job , the primary school closed , 55 % will have finished school and 45 % university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian im@@ azi human activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise in the number of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that in particular , unemployment has become more recently worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z @-@ coming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process of employment : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not preferred Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will with@@ drew access to working places in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their living outside of their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their suburbs and surname to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and to be placed so even the Arabic names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ as@@ azi must end@@ ure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for su@@ ic@@ ide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ic@@ ide is avoidable .

&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - particularly white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well through thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it is about what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women will encounter sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth ceiling , and that discrimination is still moving through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of it and I lei@@ surely double and tri@@ p@@ ly below .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I come to talk on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community , or on black women , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists , and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were to be silent . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - come together to lift their voices and sing &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , to sing my lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of racial violence , which we are exposed to black women on two times . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin of origin make less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls with a migration background more often referred to as white girls due to open integration problems .
or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and all men have no skin colour which have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can consider myself as a black woman not one movement ; in whose center the white woman stands to take into account both the gender and the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sphere , who still rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner said 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse me to join group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b me through cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs , in order to advance its ego@@ ic program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to specify white women the importance of over@@ cuts of skin colour and gender equality . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to reward a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different homes a home and borders themselves from the white femin@@ ism , still lies the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
I get rid of it to get rid of me entirely from the femin@@ ism and to join me the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism which is so stub@@ born to my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
&quot; it is more important than ever before that we define black women after our own ideas and embar@@ k into the spheres , which will be created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves ) by making us completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , that the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and because of my being as a part of this paradig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither passed nor ignored , nor is rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dock against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this contribution from To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published to En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports a special about international efforts for resol@@ ving environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a Content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
over the past 7 years Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in Can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kur@@ distan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of storage offices , the pollution and the un@@ controll@@ able development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting rivers , streams and water trails in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq resident documentary fil@@ mer@@ in and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , filmed and edited . &quot;

Paraguay women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; to express their pain through the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ lich@@ ef@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
the majority of names have been changed to protect people .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their Ex@@ e that has become violent to violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship had passed a little time and the police said , their statement would be placed at the hands , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena , because of distr@@ action , the ac@@ ten@@ able display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved back to her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women need to re@@ funding at all , they generally do not receive any support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases women also depend on the men , which they mis@@ led . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , to be victims of violence at all . &quot;
&quot; content and statisti@@ c 2 invisible missions and a judicial system , which is nothing under@@ ni@@ v@@ 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ led , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gen@@ der@@ wonder at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports , which have not even demonstrated the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the figures currently available are alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , at the District of the Prosec@@ ution unit 9@@ 600 ads , because of domestic violence . at 70 % of it went on violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads , because of domestic violence among the peace courts . even here 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women spoke that they were physically mis@@ led , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women of Ministers of Ana Bai@@ ardi , only few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; on any woman who re@@ funded in Paraguay due to psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman who re@@ funded because of physical activity , are two women who do not do this , &quot; they explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s genocide in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ence , the prosec@@ ution authorities can not adequately documented how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
alone up to August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ ic@@ ide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible missions and a judicial system that doesn &apos;t take anything
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but still after . this should help them forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she contributed the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable on the har@@ dest : &quot;
I have never thought that I would once again be victims of mis@@ uses .
&quot; if I have read about it earlier , I always thought that only women happened to sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they dec@@ eive by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report on the distr@@ action by Carlos Vera .
&quot; to name no name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his rewards and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and not left him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of failure would have at least a certain fellow blame . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner fled them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of mis@@ uses .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; their wealthy partner managed to make it even to convince them that they were worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as advertisements when the authorities remained without the result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a process against their former partners who developed into an un@@ locking legal battle between Paraguay and its native country , in which it mainly went on money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paraguay laws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but are not being applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen I@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , looks also great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , the draft law was discussed under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; this Has@@ ht@@ ag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
the original cause of the law sees before the fem@@ ini@@ d to be explained and harder to pun@@ ish it as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; the law@@ ful text was altered in some points to also win members for the law , the feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are paved , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be pun@@ ished with up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended to cost the bulk of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) procedures that have to carry the victims of violence themselves , if they just want to re@@ funding and receive a secure accommodation , the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law does not be effective if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors will not provide adequate financial resources for them :
&quot; in Paraguay , Mis@@ sing abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ think must take place that violence is no longer considered to be normal . &quot;
&quot; who , in view of these facts tac@@ kl@@ ed , makes it guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators brought away . &quot;
&quot; we have to refund so long display , until failure is no longer regarded as normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law were changed however . among other things , a passage was taken by the partners in cases of domestic violence towards reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is considered a big set@@ back . &quot;
this article is the shortened version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ lich@@ ef@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
the majority of names have been changed to protect people .
independent media in O@@ man continues to be exposed to a newspaper to ban a newspaper
&quot; this website was locked because of a decision from the information of the Information Council , &quot; on the homepage of the Ab@@ bot@@ s Zeitung Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the Canadian authorities have closed the independent Arabic @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage about corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is im@@ pris@@ oned a one @-@ year imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial later , but came back again . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had put his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a State of State . &quot;
&quot; since then , he dressed in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , commander of the forces of the Arm@@ ed Forces , Finance Minister , Minister of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ ans is marked by the persist@@ ence efforts of security forces , especially the domestic intelligence , public freedom , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and further activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure , and the imprisonment of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Chief @-@ editor of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , after the paper was published on 26 July 2016 in the judiciary , and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government accused , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man have put under pressure to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance . &quot;
issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 he was arrested by Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the editorial committee , loaded from the ISS prior to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS Chief Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j were firmly established after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as chief editor .
&quot; the newspaper was closed at un@@ specific time after the Information Council had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 the first trial was held in Mas@@ kat the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to Pr@@ ison and also ord@@ ained the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience and the le@@ qui@@ fication of guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year imprisonment and charges in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollar ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a cash prize to a height of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollar ) after having the use of an information network for spreading material that could be a danger to public order &quot; found guilty .
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a deposit was fixed at the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the judgment of judgment .
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ als Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i on a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 , after the completion of his six @-@ month imprisonment . Al @-@ Ha@@ j is still im@@ pris@@ oned in prison , where he was im@@ pris@@ oned his sentence . &quot;
the Ap@@ pe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Information Department to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n go back , the newspaper sees itself exposed to attack by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January the information sm@@ ine was a statement , with which the closure of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 the information sm@@ in@@ ister signed a further instruction , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister has been renewed for another time against the decision of the appeal , which gave the release of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases in which in O@@ man , the freedom of the press was in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; other violations include the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to make an end to the comprehensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and uncondi@@ tionally release ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can leave their work . &quot;
3 . protect freedom of press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can un@@ law@@ ful their legitimate human rights , and without fear of defic@@ ien@@ cies , including local chic@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization which support human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , Blog@@ ger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf Region and in adjacent states by promoting opinion and freedom of opinion , supported and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , figure is carried out with its consent . &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need on site medical research there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global health , many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have been far ahead in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments for exploring these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , while building its own research capacity in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Central Center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , particularly as the AIDS epide@@ mic first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he researched himself on HIV @-@ Virus before joining it back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ische healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about confusion about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . thereby , I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I have just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think is the most important scientific issues in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there are no basic research here . we just put solutions to have changed elsewhere .
&quot; that has to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being by yourself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratories is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; R@@ W : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , Big Data , research of outer space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; R@@ W : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and that gives access to scientific expertise that present here challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that periodic@@ als make articles accessible to pay only ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed manufacturers are changing global food production
&quot; this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant , grown by NASA astr@@ on@@ au@@ ts in the space , and consumed . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was done only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ at@@ ters can get , bo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it further . &quot;
&quot; the patents exp@@ ire not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more such patents have been registered in more and more plants like cer@@ eal or cart@@ els varieties . due to these trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition zü@@ bred Mor@@ ton still salad , but it now needs more than ever since its work is continually being sc@@ aled more and more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock bread , in order to pick up the che@@ at . &quot;
&quot; so we have to make this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that this patents go far to Sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stick to judgment , no one can grow out a new sal@@ at@@ sor@@ bers because all of them are patented . thus , it &apos;s just as good as possible and try to produce those characteristics which he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful about it and makes every effort to use material , which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he has also joined a movement which is growing in the USA and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
astr@@ on@@ au@@ ts of the International space station ISS have red tube sal@@ at of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten there . there will be tested whether plants in the space can be cultivated .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT area , not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired from the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and gene@@ tically are not protected as intellectual property , and therefore are usable for plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , U.S. bree@@ ders can commit to others that they can freely use the seed . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed , and it does not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned by many plant pat@@ ente or prescribed . &quot;
do@@ zens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison und Os@@ si presentation , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seeds , according to him , plays a role in larger interaction such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; who would like to buy food and sustain@@ ably more frequently in the global agricultural industry . &quot; &quot; who is offered good , locally and sustainable produced vegetables , as it is offered on farmers , like this vegetables are bred . &quot;
dietary pol@@ arity without seed @-@ confident is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit to other their seed continues to be available free of charge . thus , its procedure is in contrast to patent seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available generic pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is therefore always available , shr@@ inking . &quot;
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD @-@ thesis with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cart@@ els is protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bree@@ ders either at all or difficult . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ juice @-@ built plants like wheat in even bigger style is patented than salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are thus bred that they are targeted to their undes@@ irable characteristics - from such , by which their tastes or their colour improves up to such , due to those they prosp@@ er in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of pat@@ ched on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders are increasing through more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary but necessary since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predic@@ table .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ man Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company is responsible for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that the intellectual property dict@@ ines other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ varying innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that anyone can follow , once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
&quot; such protection inhi@@ bits innovation not , but promotes them by making the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the other : 20 years of waiting until a patent exp@@ ires , is certainly not a innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if one has been waiting for a long time to grow to plants , which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , they would have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources are always a general public and they should remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ astic incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton is bother@@ ed on the concept to patent plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features even . &quot;
the plants form themselves out and as bree@@ ders we finally have no idea how the plants do .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ ders in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who bred a sor@@ ting , ch@@ asti@@ ly also its own values into them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in the industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ al , for whose cultivation is needed her@@ bic@@ ide , who are bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly mod@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; while some medium sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , make it possible to survive the most smaller seed company , even without patents - either refuse it , or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for his breeding garden sal@@ ads .
photo of Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of plant patented innovative would : &quot; it looks like I with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are pat@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue as I know that my competi@@ tor will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are twenty years ahead of competition , with what you think it is quite easy to think about it . &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept spreads rapidly in the meantime but quickly all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the range of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed plant , and helps them to breed new varieties , meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds , and to sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col works on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legal form of the Os@@ si obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding different from country to country , whose Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional plants should not be patented , so that this speaks against the current practice of the European patent system , patents on conventional crops . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend for pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization currently includes a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the budget@@ ary next year the official start drop . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit @-@ development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database for seed and biodiversity in the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report . it represents that farmers have the opportunity to engage in seeds , to exchange it and to ensure stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable change is emphas@@ ised - a connection , from the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si , hopes that soon more people will be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly been respected where and as something grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to clarify the people that are even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
even more and more un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend around the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August , the network released an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have critic@@ ised for this step , critic@@ ised the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Con@@ trac@@ t- , despite this attack and constitution by the authorities , who were to defend their purpose in order to overcome freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities had to be exhausted , so that all technical possibilities had to be exhausted , so that all technical possibilities had to be exhausted , so that all technical possibilities had to be exhausted . we insist on to fulfill our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I also applies to the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked over two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of we@@ aks to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources of human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ D@@ S@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the Colom@@ bian and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he does not write websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up , to deal with the c@@ ens@@ ory apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the objective of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider at which also Zi@@ adas blog is native , however , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student prot@@ esters and took a video how the police exercised bodily violence against two students . &quot;
his article focuses primarily on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced in the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; however , blogs to sper@@ ren is very old , however , has priority priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and although the blocking of blogs might not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a reward , a attempted assass@@ ination , a attempted assass@@ ination by the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proved that I have not written in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to deal with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , when they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ments and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) sper@@ r@@ ten Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06@@ th of August 133 websites . this took technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documents the blocking of vendors , through the envel@@ ope of intern@@ al@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that began VP@@ N@@ s . &quot;
&quot; such practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter , to the Egyptian users may have access . &quot;
&quot; the situation will additionally be mer@@ ged that the c@@ ens@@ ory decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , which they can proceed to the court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government to go to the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be the next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day for day report newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous Post@@ card motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old I shot in school , &quot; &quot; J@@ eden second day is murdered by a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ st@@ ine Ph@@ armacy with military weapons &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends the 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in an in@@ ex@@ ed financial situation , the wave of violence reached in Rio in the highest state for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports as these are ever daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial article &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision stated the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex , etc. all that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will call in the heading &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists don &apos;t have our eyes close to the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video which was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rests in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize war at all .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper explains that , according to the Institute for Intern@@ al Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
the article continues to write the newspaper :
&quot; we realize that a war dis@@ rup@@ t@@ cy , if it is distor@@ ted , too , can also be used to dec@@ eive the atro@@ cities of the police that only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they benefit ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l argu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , to call the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibilities in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - like extra in the analysis of military income in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ counter@@ f@@ ect negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
to remember : the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro than &quot; the violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mor@@ row of the federal state , Rio on place 16 , &quot; writes them . &quot;
&quot; extra is the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which emphasises the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; on these safety policy measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ fu@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim consists of cap@@ turing a massive police force a Fav@@ ela and to have a unity permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent crime . for several years , the U@@ PP was actually able to protect against a number of reports and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities who actually should protect the neu@@ tered police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio is not the - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; besides legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this is calling for the state to use the means and paths , which are typical of a war . in addition , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; mist@@ aken balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the war towards or her , however , is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ elas continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
a week it is now that the police officers with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho er@@ kl@@ om@@ m to strike the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this authority , this incident made the head@@ line : a or@@ res@@ eller died a result of shots that had led the police out of a helicop@@ ter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization P@@ ax and the Research Institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons passed on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the mass@@ acre was exer@@ ted by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre was exer@@ ted by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 this led by rebels controlled areas outside Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to local residents on local or through tunnel and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food @-@ strength makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; shareholder of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided for cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because one can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that already has been fighting for three years to know this project , and thr@@ ust his relief that it is now more and more dedicated to famili@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , we use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to the plant@@ ation of fungus , such as Lei@@ la about Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article they achieved over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue until Monday , 04 . September 2017 , continuing donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that maintain temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity in 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel capacity , local fuel capacity are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with &quot; production from the region &quot; &quot; fung@@ al &quot; &quot; before making their quality super@@ vised and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . when this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; textbook for the region &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the start of the project and after further 3 months , they have been distributed to mushrooms throughout the east of Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al breeding for several reasons &quot; : break of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency in a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to establish new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
the creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege is visible .
we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; they appreciate that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts in the northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June occurred in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy , where it was caused by the fires of 64 deaths and over 200 . &quot;
&quot; according to the European fores@@ try system that monitors the forest area by satellite images , alone in 2017 in Portugal about 500,000 hectares of forest , alone - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture from the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts of no fire .

numerous videos spread on the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the events :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy ...
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preference and fire fighting measures through the state .
&quot; people asked yourself why civil protection was not able to include the extent of the tragedy as far as possible . &quot;
João So@@ ver@@ al from the Bund of the farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
there were roads and villages for everything and nothing evac@@ u@@ ated .
&quot; this Sunday they did not , there is nowhere : there are frag@@ mentary reports of open streets , surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy as in June could happen again , as the streets were very late locked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits are inter@@ viewed with a high degree of fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a broad proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had introduced the government following severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was raised by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government carried out a relaxation of the law which if the applicant could not be allowed , if the applicant could be built through means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything was built in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of light fl@@ amm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species continues to expand . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when any citizen information sought or were trying to contact them , offline was offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time over the location and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched by the developers João P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so crucial that the server did the an@@ ew of the 40@@ 0.000 users , which followed the fires , there were no more than half a million per@@ missions . &quot;

the conquest of Afghanistan began in the autumn of 1994 by the Taliban .
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings that had defeated the short@@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother had not said it then , she knew her son would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
in dawn the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the sl@@ ump .

&quot; Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ ara dominating the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many ha@@ ara felt suddenly vulnerable . &quot;
the Taliban known for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara known Taliban ever closer .
many ha@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his flight found apple in Pakistan again .
he worked for a few years in a cohesion . the work was hard and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left by his small wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and s@@ laugh@@ ing sa@@ ws with mort@@ ar that were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , life of refugees in Iran was dominated by poverty and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , dis@@ appearances in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we s@@ our n@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we do not fro@@ st at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ ks left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered from the boat and str@@ and@@ ed on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ ks came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was As@@ ha@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which distributed twice a day food in need of relief . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for deriv@@ ative asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the Human Rights Association of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special occasion centers , &quot; it is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an entry center if they officially have submitted a request for asylum - which can still be done after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or must sleep on the street . &quot;
so it also erg@@ dis@@ cs .
&quot; but his inno@@ cu@@ ous wisdom , helped astr@@ on@@ ists to get out of these conditions soon . &quot;
&quot; after having made several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ ks tasted all its entire savings into the creation of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a mu@@ red lim@@ b .
&quot; As@@ ha@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( English : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian ) &quot; &quot; ( Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director , A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; in 2017 the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which has been awarded for the 24th time . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years some of Afghanistan were created , including dres@@ sm@@ iles , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff mostly consist of refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant relates through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneurs Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets are far beyond the Italian restau@@ rat@@ e@@ wer@@ be and the retail trade and aim to return to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ ks with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else .
&quot; dis@@ appearances also for@@ ged plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn the packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; this way , they can sell their harv@@ ests on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; As@@ ha@@ af has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ti@@ zen @-@ Report : &quot; &quot; legislative acts of Egypt &quot; &quot; allow social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in custo@@ dy . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian parliament is scrut@@ ini@@ zed a draft law , which fores@@ ee that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after a registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after most successful legislation on the website of the authority , by giving their full name , as well as its number . &quot;
those who are dre@@ amed of this step could be sentenced to six months imprisonment or the en@@ closure of a criminal trial .
&quot; the law , which was advertis@@ ed by six@@ teen members of Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative committee as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , a further dep@@ uty issued a bill that would be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the surveillance of the president or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law the Bel@@ ar@@ ation of the President as well as state institutions are already criminal . under the law proposition , such action would be ground@@ ed with pris@@ ons and money pen@@ alties , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can bo@@ ast up to three years in prison for aging . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photographed on 13 August 2013 , whereas the Egyptian polic@@ emen demonstrated against the military put@@ sch , who had led against the military coup against the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in jail at a judgement date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the prison @-@ guide according to human rights groups has failed to bring the def@@ endants of prison in the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty on the basis of one , so many human rights groups agreed , head@@ burden of among other weapons , illeg@@ i@@ ent assembly , murder and temp@@ ted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza gave the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary free . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Ab@@ dull@@ ah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in advance of the mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist activ@@ ist activ@@ ist documents
May we spent Tunisi@@ an authorities six hours with the inter@@ ni@@ r of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia which was co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly listening to a sc@@ anned action plan . best plan origin@@ ates from the President of the Republic to guarantee the merchants and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali by the corruption of accused officers of am@@ nest@@ y provided that these all un@@ law@@ ly preserved funds will be with@@ drawn .
&quot; this document published on 21 April on the document of Na@@ wa@@ at document , thro@@ ws a light on how the prepar@@ atory plans look to the support of the legislation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the disclosure of his sources by giving an article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press co@@ dex which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their cre@@ denti@@ al ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Information Committee of the State council of the People &apos;s Republic of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need permission to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that registration with the full @-@ full name will be required . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st suspected that such by the elimination of anonymous comments can be achieved within social networks , it is still unclear how the authorities use these rules . &quot;
Chinese networks have proposed in social media to enforce these provisions only selective in order to safeguard the local journ@@ alism and its independence .
see you then in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or failed We@@ chat , himself to register in the state government as &quot; organizer of the information @-@ prolifer@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government will organize a list of online services that allow the &quot; publication of information &quot; to charge the removal of content and force them on request for sending user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages currently include websites such as v@@ contacted and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mailbox and sc@@ anned other services . &quot;

&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication was blocked , the page has been blocked because they work on &quot; a source of information , which collabor@@ ates with groups to am@@ end a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is thus , next to China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;

&quot; the government has consul@@ ted with telecommunications companies and intelligence services relating to the proposal , but has led other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwar@@ ded to the Department of ministry . &quot;
