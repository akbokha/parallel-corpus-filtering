<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, joined American music, American writers and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist for an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as 14-year, I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the gray Grantham in The Pelican, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil magnates that were the top Federal Court with judges, who wanted to inclined his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to method Man," I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only reinforced. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming, that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very warm love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bottlenght.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague express it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroicans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people react to his statements and voted in Schars for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he had won in the Republican elections, was the highest number one of the party nominate candidate ever achieved."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters in tune with the people whom I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist who took people from around the world, a deeply glorious person, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "was agreed with the current editor of Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I had met us at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "in the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I lived in Sandy Bahr, who fought for their lives for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappl who always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors which helped me much with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values they embodied by they embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"as Trump's way to the nomination of Republican presidential data, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of its restricted vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either split its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlooked these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as a racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people," "said one of my friends, is exactly what has led to us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most know are, for Trump, because they would like to regain control of a country that has it disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who have commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt on those who look different from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "whitelash" "(Anm.).: as much as" the elongation of the whites against all other ethnies "; phrase from white in playful on the whites and whiplash, which means as much as seudertrauma) as it was the great Van Jones, has exactly what America has made so magnificent."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like, America is every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on Ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word-change with the crowds.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a laught "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "brood the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "answered them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they called and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a one-vote and a loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan ended in words:" God be thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Trumps Country, told the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combustift the wilde illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is performed as part of an agreement with Global Voices on shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, that this ship had already been operated in liberianian waters of illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">East African countries were consequently being brought up and little inclined to welcome a blasts of this kind at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the combo, Mozambique and Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refuse to give him a fishing permit and refuse to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Uri was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refuse everything, "remember Benedict Kiilu, a leitner of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team that discovered the ship time and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the country stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had then driven the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" thus we have eight countries, who are like minded and working together. they exchange information and stand out one another where it is about illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured is hidden because it is extremely difficult to split up. thus the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional contempt of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm, which have a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once disabled by bureaucratic hurdles and as well as through the snail, the actions occur today in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange with each other and exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when these are moving around the open sea, through satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships, which fish in harbottled fields - some such that indicate that a ship invites his caught fish on the road on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such surveys can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and may possibly also whether they have a criminal register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are opposed to illegal fishing, may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means that vessels could not sell their charging. and that they might even be forced to pay the penalties of penalties as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishing will be no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Executive Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost turnover, which are the eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to the illegal fishermen who penetrate in eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish embroideries because of the region's commercial fishing from around the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions like the sailing under falsely flag, fake liceners, indication of phantasizing, the fishing protected species and the fish in nature reserve."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" you are targeted the lack of international cooperation and make sure the weaknesses of a non-indebtless organized control system, "says Long." "earlier a ship could not go illegally fishing and a country could then say 'You do not walk my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legal lowing tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies surveyed ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has criminals networks being exposed, the fake licenses used in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been tracked and found guilty ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authorities to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks organized crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that should help FISH-i, suspicious ships of precise information."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, also helps the illegal ships to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fishing data and at ISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships also turn off their automatic identifier systems, with which they cannot be accessed more of satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels together. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">"but at ISH, FISH-i's team can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?"</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believe this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Seeana Oceana platform opened the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed through the position of each individual ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "working together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that results simply meaning," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigate."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run, with which a global system allows persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals but they also shy.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, which had formerly confiscated without a license and hardly to reckon with consequences, know now that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i participating countries have now purchased a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats have since buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after the ISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 discrete, found the inspectors there on board tow, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries have joined together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also they are fighting the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest members of Somalia had his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under the wrong flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and were used Schleppner, which are now forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also inforged in bothless waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1 found a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative way work to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to overturn, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transmit it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in case of maternity. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers should be."</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French mother's language should be translated from English to French - not from the French into english.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue, the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for oversetting, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers, Japanese learning."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who do not have foreign employees, are nevertheless company produced internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best, for translators - no matter how good or bad his voice knowledge really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the distorted and puzzling sets that arise through machine translations, show that this technique may not replace a long translator for a long time. this is true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic appearance, which often uses T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood at all."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable to jewelry yet acceptable, or at least harmless. but by large companies or from the government who have the funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi in the prefecture of Miyagi, the prefecture of Miyagi, which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring forces of Fukushima and Ivate have been unevacuated because the tsunami had vanished whole coastal cities out of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition to this, the prefecture of Fukushima still lived a nuclear accident, for this reason alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The Special Report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made six years after the progress of the local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re-building authorities as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing design in Fukushima, Miyagi and Ivate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (the workstation, Scenai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Ivate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the greatest success among the three prefectures could draw Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, one still makes every effort to strive for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfswald (Bowlan, kasetsu juutaku) in final spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple-catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw forced to live in bed shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Ivate in such arrangements."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 per cent of the year 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful than 75 percent of the evacuated sheltered, were converted into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Ivate the number here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="560">"how the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the unhappiness until December 2016, which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"during almost 100 per cent of the fishing marinas in Ivate and Miyagi are now back into operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fisheries harbours its operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the atomic accident, have moved in the three prefectures of agricultural land in large-scale homes."</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 per cent of its agricultural areas with just 66 percent of the agricultural land in Ivate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural field in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima are located in the" "nuclear waste". ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered, and again, Fukushima still remains downbeat."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Ivate are back to 90 per cent on the same level, as before the unhappiness. Fukushima, however, can only be 75 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it was more difficult to find their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"to find an overall picture, the newspaper led numerous respondents among the native population and under the evacuated forces. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also, as its receptivity to the tsunami risk has changed."</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung writes:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey conducted that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper also reinforced its attention to the position of evacuated of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima still had to experience the enormous earthquakes and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also the witness of the worst, catastrophy, nuclear accidents, the Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23 000 people had been converted back to Fukushima, in durable spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophes, most of the evacuties are still growing in Behelfswald, older than 50 years old. you have to compete in proper Behausages, because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Ivate and Fukushima. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>

<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is injured or sad. it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I can no longer be valid or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10 year-year's cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) will be when he is great. and it's not normal that people are listening to the" "heroism" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of men is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were.</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak that they are spared by such tragedies when they are not stir and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four months of extortion in the main town district: how a family has been plagued with threats, until they had destroyed the business at the end not only the business but also their family apart. "</seg>

<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents worry about them."</seg>

<seg id="804">He tells about the nine fobs on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>

<seg id="813">These are just a few of a hundred thousand stories that organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those that we may not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprena Vivir Con El Narco "," Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 has launched the data journalism project of Narcodata, whose aim consists of the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading that has tormented the country over the last four decades, in an understanding way.

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well known social network participated in their posts from the web because it contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people east-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook is censored the word" Kalar "or," workstation "" (in burmesan script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of sharks in Burma in the social network. "</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abusive connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight sharks in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself calls not automatically" Hassle "." "</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; a lot of people have reported that posts that they have seen the use of the word or have doubts as a doubt for his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burglean words with the different meanings that have the same letter such as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing' written, which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar PAE '(Spage),' Kalar oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '( curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they knew how he could lint his back pain, that he made a word game."</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmesan - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different. "</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that they will decrease Hasslanguage radial nationalists, but also that Facebook analytic will be analytical before it all Posts holes, which in suspects, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the following words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" Kalar PAE "(Spaging)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists spread, the hasslanguage spread, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone, disseminate the harasslanguage, the efficiency of this strategy does not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords are often a cat- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the ensored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, as Facebook began to clear his posts when he wanted to communicate his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook, and I was banned from content for 24 hours, because the post office" Facebook Community standards was not met. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts of people who do not have any negative intentions or that simply try to show their opinions against the hate-speaking nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with Hasslanguage:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative to ask for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To zenise these words will only bring more hate within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"it seems as if they have started it without local context or technical support, and as words such as' chair" or "inheritance curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they were not trying to correct the falsibly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has taken care of much spott among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now funny and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage to see whether their pokes are taken from the grid."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts, which have no hassed language, but nevertheless removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1338">Facebook was to be criticized for his failure to bring out the most advanced hassals on his burmesan pages under control.</seg>

<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India there are women with greatest care, to express the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women give to that they respect the husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disrespect this practice in life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state Odisha from the Indian State Odisha, condemned by her family and the village community, having responded to a stopped relative with name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not call upon the name, is also common among men. however, they have much less access to fear, if at all, they should not come out of this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, played nine women, including health spersonal as well as housewives, a unique club, and thus became quickly the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and stands up for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of her videocamera in the uncovering of practices, such as children's marriage up to the bond of HIV- and AIDS Ininfected, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how this clubs created a safe place for these women and they have done simultaneously to ambassesses of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion discussion, played by women who do not call their spouses."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem that women could easily identify itself.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of their husbands not uttered out loud, is a Brotherhood, which they all maintain their duties and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman wishes to respect her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is regarded as a chizer, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning of Rohini, who had never called her husband to show her husband previously, as it's going on."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion board her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband left for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I solves him from now on with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self confidence in the luggage, Rohini launched its first discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "and never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the videoprojection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," If we cannot say the name of our marriage, but they can call us as they want, means that they cannot respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day when they brought their husbands over their lips over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Breaks of a century-old tradition, in which women never married the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was just before the whole exercise; a different decided to let the whole confiscated frustration against him and his family by tread him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an old bridge, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their spouses in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Rohini received a variety of reports in the following days.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas they put into his head: his wife could not stop his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner in front of the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she moved her, she got fear and said that there was an error."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini argued, I solves it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in itself was less understanding and the situation of arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports as women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the vanizing red point on the forehead, which shows the spans:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberred point, if he also worked."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only sounds and I heard it to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely ended up, but my, they are now in a better position to choose even if not to carry him in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip on any discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I do not want to worry that women could make sure what could hear," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and talked about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have heard about some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only Saris since their salvation.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it was the okay, but some wanted a salary spa, a far shirt about a pants, wear; they have not been dreamed."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of your own clothes choice, morals associated with the Saris and much more, jewellery made Rohini its own pair of tas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where she can wear Jeans and Rohini is certain that they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion has changed, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then also listened to the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some of me included, make it still, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Just one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women carry now at any time Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discothetical club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - as the feasts for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other confidence, it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman walks in the club at home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from balanced groups in India and make videos about stories about which not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages of those who themselves experience themselves, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development needs."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered a city in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at a meeting of the international branches of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister of New York announced that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because it was compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supportive that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>

<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>

<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to rotate the logic to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country, we hear that we will not be any country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the notice of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory violation."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons led by Shangrgam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal "countries, in view of its, it appeared invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, he defends the idea that Singapore with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared, equally cities that are permanent from a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old corps of the authoritarian rulers appear to be the Democrats, leave the rotated logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>

<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is to which land is part of our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I do not understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shangrgam, would take the trouble to clarify this point unless he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog his comment, he pointed out regarding the critics concerning the critics concerning the testimonials of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the title.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore is more of a" city "than a country," he stated why the elections in Singapore were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He missed Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party a party?).</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he really is concerned and aware what he defended."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review zerects the shortcomings of Shanmugams objections:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "gutbeliever has committed a mistake, or was it a mischier spokesman?"</seg>

<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>

<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We always were a city.</seg>

<seg id="2070">"my scream fell not yet enough, so she made the pipe with a cable interchangeable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest I asked myself whether the investigator had worked as a garbage dump, or if it belonged to normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cable stripped together to present us the, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within one hour of one hour three of them are changing, while I still was on the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice, which is why I heard to cry out."</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner remarked the cooling and found no favor of being an electric charged stab.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"flow flowed my entire body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my semi-naked body, the spread on the ground was the perfect power leader."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must probably have been at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep myself again, let's say that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours left, which occurred to me as minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning fulfils the room" .Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of a depleted young people:" "my Lord, my father needs to worry about fear."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent and beaway you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always been freed.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speak about the rights of LGBTQ + -community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he mounts to his screen, to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can leave is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine-hidden lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which had been one of them since 1967; the year, in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to escape from their village in Palestine, in which she lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist who faces conservative majority and interviewed its old proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues do not only find in cities that are rich in Syria until Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as a man who is not limited in his mind by boundaries, and he can suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it, he defeated a special disinclination against the US American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, something to do with his identity as a" Palestinian fleeing of the second generation, even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine until now. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think because of my own life circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think that" "I am a man" "while he shook up in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at that time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The law also underlines that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensing hot jitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slings speak of hot coffee and the threshing of the Kent-cigarette in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, above all if you have a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just to drink basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the Interior of Jordaniens has said an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs that support the Islamic Action Front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontskle Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country contradicts, and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former preschancellor of the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "straight" because of the sexual orientation of the Sangers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which represents the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila the jordal nation as" progressive supporters of human rights "," which continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may probably not be easily silky rhetoric, but indeed a more clearly evident reality in Jordan that reflect in Hdaib's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 Hdaib traditional sex-men clap by Leibe, that he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a apparently burnt-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honorary mordium', the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016. however, however, Jordan is still lacking that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women, the victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for interruptive control from the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of unfamiliar violence, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman is nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for that, not afraid to get back on issues which in its country is long as tababoo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib acknowledges that his work is political, however, that he is his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was saying to me policy," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed" "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "" and in "ghetto", the focus is on poverty. "</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are in the core political, can continue."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get in his words," that one wants "- be it Faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that there is hardly anyone in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals are still strongly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya, in order to later realize that his comments were torn out of the context and had been censored by his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a processed version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib also acquires Hdaib open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance against homosexuals do not dismiss Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which has remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks yourself: when Abu Nuwhat should work later on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century openly discussed homosexuality, why can Jordanian this not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Haitian kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordan intelligence service received several former government officials and members of the teacher-association, with the reason they had voiced in social media, critical about the problems which are deeply rooted in the country with deep in the land."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this is the concert of Hdaibs, according to that, only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to do a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has desperate mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - is made of slow, bedding and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place day at the heart of the jordan Society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib is dreams of another Arab world, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only of it, his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be inspired by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, Streumunitions and an artificial species. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the extent, Hdaib will continue to resign and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we just write love letters to people that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel spending, affection opposite?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question went exactly the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios, from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation), the young people dismissed letters of guerrilla letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was Acting of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guerillabewest FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombian), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was the sign of the peace contract as so important that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received for his merits the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warrior, who lived for many years in illegal camps, have been exposed to war and around the clock in round the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, to engage in their ranks and support them in building up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumbians should join and assist in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly this they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love bottances to former guillers to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the target of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former Guerillaklion, which should then be handed over to personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters for reconciliation was founded on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there, Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people that we love to write about the Valentine's Day of thousands of love letters, but those who need them to have a lot of necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he planning, he continued to share his love with people this year that most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan arose, letter of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now find their place in society and must show themselves a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse from a war history to a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">Hitherto as part of the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombian, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I have never thought, that someone would forgive me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo by the BogotArt Foundation, in order to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members presented itself as they had previously done to take the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very movable moment for everyone involved." "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between is" "told the policy knowledge of Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a colleague of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, making this unforgettable experience like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighters led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuck "(a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla fighter) saw, I saw a guerricher, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had fear that lie down, as in addition to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the thorns."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said him nevertheless," "Hello, what are they doing exactly?" "he answered," I answered a letter I wrote someone. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written a little so beautiful, therefore I answered that." "I suddenly got the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him very firm and sat down next to the pomegs.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was pity to the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life to war. he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger. "I have never imagined that someone would forgive me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that with open arms is waiting for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I just learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"fortunately, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years we have experienced, how the social injustice on the part of the Colombian people began to develop, we can contribute to the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people have never found hearing yet, and no electoral law had found, and recognize that men who often had seen as monsters and even hate even people with beautiful emotions which were turned through their life circumstances and their environment was quite painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - including those who killed and so much harm, can give us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was made that after the dearming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to raise arms and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call upon all defender of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some told me, I must prove it by going above without the streets, others, that I did not change in the official TV in Grosny and I say that I was not changed my sex, that everything was just mud, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskchenet C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people were talking about my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that is not only your family, but the entire Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we can not stir you because you are a pious woman, but you need to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she laid a strike around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car has fallen down with a sleeplate, and a number plate with a 95 dron."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends supervised the number of people - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to use their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the land, but then it happened something incredible."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without sign up without writing, without reference, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I tasted the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I didn't get a message:" "you do not believe, you do not believe in security, just because you have left the land?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, at what hotel you do. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This actually was my mould number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, about the sexually equation we do not talk, this is a tablotopic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally cascasian elements I do still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this seelian barrier can not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give it effort to look like the person to which they remember from their past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who eat a half-and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so that my I, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honour "can be experienced by blood genugtution."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even more gay men in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there would be very many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives, to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that one can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, you will show their bodies on TV and claim it, they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but specifically settled in order to radialise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">"Sabrina: I just put someone, the one and a half months in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was growing.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new since them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and that so-called Lord, this person was self-employed than these people were involved."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now they were not presented as bandits, so far there have been no reports. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know if these persecutions and abduction of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past found?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I have always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I believe, even before 2003 I was already known in Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civil" "of civil society, but ultimately has thrown back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes, the tubejeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Department of Sharia has never heard only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially in weekends, a whole group of people met like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, there met."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been besieged.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "soons not about the misfortune of another.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, when the sick about sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never sinned, never gejagt and never done."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long held this gnation time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on television on morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us, but primarily on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless - you could sense how people began to change in the city, to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who were slaughed and had eight to look at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could sense how the situation in the Republic is constantly merciful."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I'm not paying much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, merits, I accompany them to hospital and help them to get eating cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people even when I drown them.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, it does not have nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnyan, who want to know you with foam before the mouth, that there is no sbumps with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have who, the Kabardiner, which, the Russians also have what; all over the planet are they - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, therefore it is unpleasant to hear so what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here so many men come from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and live during Ramadan - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transition identity to men, men love, and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a trusts."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of sensation, to be precise, different ways of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>

<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large part of the Arab-Nazi community has been located, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard to openly deny their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-Monarchy took over power and made 1925 great efforts to complete the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran-coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most rich and valuable utility spaces for Iranian agriculture."</seg>

<seg id="2435">"the following article is an revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri, and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read the original text in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - particularly white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well through thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally should all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it is about what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women will encounter sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth ceiling, and that discrimination is still moving through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I leisurely double and triply below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, if I come to talk on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS, on black women in the LGBTIQ community, or on black women, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists, and white intersectional feminists were to be silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - come together to lift their voices and sing 'Kumbaya, to sing my lord" to achieve equal rights (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racial violence, which we are exposed to black women on two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin of origin make less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls with a migration background more often referred to as white girls due to open integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want that all women, all men and all men have no skin colour which have the same rights; on the other hand, I can consider myself as a black woman not one movement; in whose center the white woman stands to take into account both the gender and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist oriented sphere, who still rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner said 1851 in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse me to join groupings, which also absorb me through cultural appropriation of our customs and customs, in order to advance its egoic program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to specify white women the importance of overcuts of skin colour and gender equality. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to reward a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different homes a home and borders themselves from the white feminism, still lies the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">I get rid of it to get rid of me entirely from the feminism and to join me the movement of Womanism which is so stubborn to my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">"it is more important than ever before that we define black women after our own ideas and embark into the spheres, which will be created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves) by making us completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, that the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my being as a part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and processed version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weilichefefrubin) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">The majority of names have been changed to protect people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their Exe that has become violent to violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship had passed a little time and the police said, their statement would be placed at the hands, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena, because of distraction, the actenable display of Ada BÃ¡ez is nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved back to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women need to refunding at all, they generally do not receive any support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases women also depend on the men, which they misled. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, to be victims of violence at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content and statistic 2 invisible missions and a judicial system, which is nothing underniv3 Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really misled, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for genderwonder at Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports, which have not even demonstrated the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the figures currently available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District of the Prosecution unit 9600 ads, because of domestic violence. at 70% of it went on violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 ads, because of domestic violence among the peace courts. even here 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women spoke that they were physically misled, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayischen women of Ministers of Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually displayed." "on any woman who refunded in Paraguay due to psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman who refunded because of physical activity, are two women who do not do this," they explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's genocide in Paraguay is not an own criminal offence, the prosecution authorities can not adequately documented how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Alone up to August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India: how" open source "seed manufacturers are changing global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this contribution from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 sorts, such as Outredgeous, the first plant, grown by NASA astronauts in the space, and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was done only by its own ingenuity and the question how many salatters can get, bounds."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents expire not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more such patents have been registered in more and more plants like cereal or cartels varieties. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as passionate representatives of a millennia of old tradition zÃ¼bred Morton still salad, but it now needs more than ever since its work is continually being scaled more and more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock bread, in order to pick up the cheat."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to make this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that this patents go far to Salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stick to judgment, no one can grow out a new salatsorbers because all of them are patented. thus, it's just as good as possible and try to produce those characteristics which he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful about it and makes every effort to use material, which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he has also joined a movement which is growing in the USA and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" Open Source ""). "</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT area, not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seed) can be inspired from the movement for free "open source" software to provide alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and genetically are not protected as intellectual property, and therefore are usable for plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit to others that they can freely use the seed."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed, and it does not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned by many plant patente or prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison und Ossi presentation, Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seeds, according to him, plays a role in larger interaction such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "who would like to buy food and sustainably more frequently in the global agricultural industry." "who is offered good, locally and sustainable produced vegetables, as it is offered on farmers, like this vegetables are bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary polarity without seed-confident is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit to other their seed continues to be available free of charge. thus, its procedure is in contrast to patent seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available generic pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is therefore always available, shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD-thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all cartels is protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or difficult. "</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-juice-built plants like wheat in even bigger style is patented than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are thus bred that they are targeted to their undesirable characteristics - from such, by which their tastes or their colour improves up to such, due to those they prosper in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patched on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders are increasing through more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary but necessary since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesman Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company is responsible for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that the intellectual property dictines other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant-varying innovations. "" a patent is basically taken a plan that anyone can follow, once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection inhibits innovation not, but promotes them by making the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other: 20 years of waiting until a patent expires, is certainly not a innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if one has been waiting for a long time to grow to plants, which have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, they would have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources are always a general public and they should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor the money for such formalities, and monastic incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is bothered on the concept to patent plant characteristics:" we do not really create the features even. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves out and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US-state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "who bred a sorting, chastily also its own values into them."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in the industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monocultural, for whose cultivation is needed herbicide, who are bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly modelled. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, make it possible to survive the most smaller seed company, even without patents - either refuse it, or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo of Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of plant patented innovative would:" it looks like I with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patently. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue as I know that my competitor will sell my varieties in a few years," "he says." "with a patent you are twenty years ahead of competition, with what you think it is quite easy to think about it."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be leading in the" open source "breeding, the concept spreads rapidly in the meantime but quickly all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the range of resources, an" open source "seed plant, and helps them to breed new varieties, meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" open source "seeds, and to sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol works on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legal form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding different from country to country, whose Ossi obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional plants should not be patented, so that this speaks against the current practice of the European patent system, patents on conventional crops."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016 the Dutch organisation Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seeds, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend for patenting seeds."</seg>

<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the McKnight Foundation and others - published a report. it represents that farmers have the opportunity to engage in seeds, to exchange it and to ensure stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable change is emphasised - a connection, from the Luby of Ossi, hopes that soon more people will be recognized."</seg>
