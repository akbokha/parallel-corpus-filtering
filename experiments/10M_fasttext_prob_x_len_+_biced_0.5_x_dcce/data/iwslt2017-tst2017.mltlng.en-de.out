this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times Repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone heard from Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he is spectacular that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally heard illeg@@ on@@ one of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , where the CIA had literally draft an atomic bom@@ b for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter does not know at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been determined and called upon it to call its alleged sources . &quot;
in this turn it became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and journalists .
&quot; according to the first constitutional constitutional media , the media have the right to post secret information . &quot;
&quot; however , it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones . &quot;
&quot; so , when the government arrived at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ter had already done before him , he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were for years of indications that it would be indispensable for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters can always hide less and less .
&quot; instead of fail and r@@ ake to the statements , this could also carry out its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators have concerned without his consent , his phone @-@ wise secret , &quot;
&quot; just as his email data , financial and banking information , its credit office , and even fri@@ lls with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to be Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised at his arrival , to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has more condemned than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much from their work as secret . &quot;
since 11 September almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers at a journalist .
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional commitments , because the government has more possibilities to sp@@ ose all the utter@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; while they can take it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the testimony . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that had not yet been written as reven@@ ge , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source code system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers which was originally developed by the internet most famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like those of the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can send documents up@@ loading or send information , just like your usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only the respective news agency have access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot sp@@ read@@ ed more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would require , would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ y technologies that meet all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ator , like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to z@@ oom mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who wants to report about ab@@ norm@@ alities in the care of soldiers and want to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for the si@@ gh@@ ing water of Fl@@ int suggests . or a Wall@@ street @-@ insi@@ der that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data collection of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; , &quot; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we really see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the very very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has resign@@ ed .
also there are reports that an association of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ators B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad Brief@@ ing firms in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is asser@@ ted that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next publication , and upon the next unvei@@ led documents . &quot;
well it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ brand .
&quot; it seems to be crying from you , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tackle this ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide their assets , and to dev@@ our@@ ing -- something that we have been discussing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seems very confusing this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I am always present to me like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports of this matter in the USA .
presum@@ ably because there has not been a prominent American in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle according to which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; we would have a dat@@ l@@ eck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US countries you need less information to specify less information to start a company than to get a reference certificate . &quot;
&quot; this kind of transparency in the US has allowed the employees of school@@ bor@@ k , leaving school children . &quot;
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that all affects us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a covered revival in the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
&quot; our awak@@ ened gave himself as a African Minister , the suspected money to the US , to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked that all up to a lawyer from our investigations , how he could trans@@ verse his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ ached pre@@ aching . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course anyone had handed over money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as single waste .
it is not about a single lawyer who has under@@ gone our co@@ vert proposals .
it is not about a single top leaders in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to deal with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules in order to make this kind of behaviour .
&quot; this may sound very much di@@ m@@ ess , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that a lot has begun to change .
&quot; in the last few years we have seen pre @-@ violations of more transparency , which affects the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU in central stops at national level , who really lies behind firms in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill of law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress that we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ firms . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy to stand up and say , &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work for it through laws that end this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finish the in@@ transparent , which now allows this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; that is the story , as I am nearly dis@@ cour@@ aged , and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ et would be yel@@ lo@@ wed . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
&quot; there was one type in the red Maz@@ da , and looked at my things . &quot;
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you want today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
&quot; but I just got to know him just before ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maced@@ onian ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; I have a ballo@@ t . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I turned into the blank@@ et and thought , &quot; Oh husband ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild@@ ly in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I rose out of the bed , on to@@ e @-@ pointed to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he had bought from me , is in his classroom . he is now teachers . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends , who were only waiting for being discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people sitting on my air@@ mat@@ tresses , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mat@@ tresses . &quot;
&quot; take a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , fast , my ro@@ ommate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can make it happen to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have survived as we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer @-@ bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , in addition a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mat@@ tresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars at the air mat@@ tresses on wood@@ crafts .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we stayed with them through the whole city . as we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell , star@@ ched Brian and I met . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ates , N@@ ate Plate arc@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on people publicly post photos of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visit come . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can invite wild foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket would be disast@@ rous .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; nobody who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children all have learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can get on the things that you can see . we could des@@ ig@@ nen . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
&quot; we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design , among people who never had ever met . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I want to give you a cost test what degree trust we do .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your phone into the hand .
now I like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ finished mobile phone in your left seating area .
&quot; this quietly journey of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what you will feel when she opened the first time the door . &quot;
because the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ finished mobile phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just now , who does actually have Al Gor@@ es cell phone ? &quot;
could you announce that he can announce the position of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have been introduced once , with its name ; if he told where he comes , how his dog or his children would like to be called ? &quot;
imagine that you would have 150 ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents that all say : &quot; it can really hold very well un@@ finished hand@@ ys !
how would you feel when you &apos;d like to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ left feedback system rein@@ forces the trust .
in the beginning we still have done some things wrong .
&quot; it was hard for the people , to give negative app@@ rais@@ als . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both the host and guest had given their app@@ rais@@ als before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we examined a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and home . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social preference .
exciting is what you add to the call of a person -- in our case through evidence departments .
&quot; if one has less than three divisions , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation is common simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
&quot; moreover , we ro@@ de that trust is dependent on how much you are doing . &quot;
here you can see the reaction to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if one tells about too little as &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you are saying much , as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- &quot; I am not accepted the request . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; &quot; t@@ opping art works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create design with design this degree of openness ?
&quot; we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics one should write something . &quot;
&quot; our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help , overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards foreigners . &quot;
&quot; what we did not expect , was the great multitude of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people are entitled to our offer .
you can recognize three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need , which had not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business is currently very good .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who are non @-@ allowed parties celebrated or dwell@@ ings .
hosts will have guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is already hur@@ ting if I just think .
&quot; disappointment that you hear in the voice of the invo@@ icing , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , a fraction of the 123 million spent nights only a fraction of the problem . &quot;
because people trusted one another to law .
&quot; if trust works , there can be no wonder . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who are ti@@ d@@ ded due to sitting activities at heart attack . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save one life , even though they do not know anything . &quot;
&quot; you drive a car in the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay will run .
but these relations behind the pure money trans@@ forms are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled about this term I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just a &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , the human relationship promises . &quot;
people put a part of themselves openly and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is compared with Fast Food and it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place one would have visited , a group of Ans@@ wer would wait to fill a thoroughly and one with a pub tour of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to organize apartments from the ground up to one side ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would have to share the thought of sharing ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and deport@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in Southern Cor@@ e@@ as capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking , who belonged to the government , &quot;
&quot; now ships were offered . students , who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were given to people whose children were educated . there have been inc@@ ub@@ ator programs , &quot;
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . about our platform alone today will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries as a guest of a foreig@@ ner or even host .
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not rein@@ stall the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has exactly our works ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find the ast@@ o@@ unding :
down@@ ward overwhelming .
&quot; I have to think about it , if a red Maz@@ da is passing by me . &quot;
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us when it had this great influence , I ask myself what we can soon be able to use design . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you see me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or suppres@@ sed to under@@ wear a brain @-@ under@@ wear ?
or simply a delay at the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look as look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most of them would not know Muslims .
probably the people do not talk to their poll@@ s drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- dou@@ bling es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
a Mö@@ ller @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , Baby , I was not born . &quot;
I have decided on this .
when I was 17 years old I met my decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual person , such as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I chose to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were kidn@@ apped : &quot; why do you oppressed you yourself ?
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and indeed opposite the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only believed in the faith of my parents .
I have the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , was placed in question , des@@ perate and believed ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with any reading of the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines .
I realize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel that somebody takes you truly , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering . &quot;
&quot; I later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that horrible morning occurred in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had ended up at the end , looked on the screen and looked at the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flo@@ wn in buildings , people sp@@ ill from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned fast to indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; I moved the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; , &quot; ... Zer@@ bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it was not only attacked my country , but in the N@@ u turned the deeds of others from a civil war to a suspic@@ ious . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the United States to draw in a new city and start learning in learning . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove -- as we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; sam@@ pled you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then there was Friday in that week -- the day , at which Muslims meet for prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of this .
&quot; the feelings were mis@@ understand@@ ably , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who held for Muslims , into free , and sm@@ ote for Muslims . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because the people who had attacked this land , have attacked our country . &quot;
I swe@@ pt the w@@ ut of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing about questions , I love questions . &quot;
those are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to serve Muslims and mo@@ urn .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we vi@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our one is as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our one thinks only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , creators , and Olympi@@ oni@@ ks . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America be safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking spaces , but do not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to show people to other faith toler@@ ant , and larger citizen participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told us : people are indeed not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; when the radic@@ alization process has been noticed that he can cut online . as a first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the person believes that terrorists are true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still af@@ firm that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS produces its brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslim , as mother , as a mother , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to their imagination , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1,6 billion faithful . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology reasons in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you have a look at it , it is not driving what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding I@@ mam recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit with whom she spoke , she brought her to silence , and told her that their anger , her sense of injustice in the world , they would only bring into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that could have been given to their anger , it was a main objective for the instrument@@ alisation by the extre@@ mi@@ sts that gave it a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam presented the connection to God and their church again .
&quot; instead of accused her for her anger , he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , keep them to join the IS . &quot;
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy from our thinking ?
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show , if we fear , pass at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we are accepting a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ form@@ ance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you have reported test people , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an ak@@ ade@@ mis@@ tic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims came to the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the preparation of Iraq war and during two constitu@@ encies .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to cut out the foundation of a free society , which has sensible and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is a breakfast sign .
&quot; we may feel it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; in assignment of collective blame , it is not just about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was ented at the dental faculty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when is out of my br@@ otherhood , such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ anj that was in the afternoon when he was posted there by Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he f@@ oss eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or were we staying safe at home ?
&quot; we had it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we left to our children : one that would be able to control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided on the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , took my shoes off , went into the prayer sh@@ alle , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made a notice , bed@@ bled himself and was welcome our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who were not to join us but to assist us . &quot;
in that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ces had .
what will you choose ?
what are you choosing at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go to number safe ?
or join the ones that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself what you say to those who may say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a reason@@ ing with dr@@ au@@ ght , an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you do not dec@@ eive . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it allows .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever performed study on Muslims throughout the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family ; they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for Bas@@ ler , it is about to be a billion euro business . &quot;
&quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . possible , this is made in research institutes worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air up@@ setting in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six metre high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
through inter@@ locking aviation high speed and acceleration in the narro@@ west room .
you can also build self @-@ confident structures .
&quot; you have learned to wear the loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react on natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order to operate a system autonomous , it must know collective compl@@ ac@@ ces , where in the space the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an int@@ eger of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands is available at the highest E@@ ben@@ e. e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so@@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a plane , which tries to hit two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most of the star@@ ters , it is fluctu@@ ate , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of hed@@ ging is that they are sensi@@ tively react to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind @-@ bo@@ il .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the airplane doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be reg@@ ained and the performance by practicing can be improved .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often present fundamental abstract issues that are at the heart of the cause . &quot;
&quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the small number of movable parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts , which work together to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained air@@ planes could fly tel@@ ev@@ ous aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot;
&quot; we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest TV @-@ served plane . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross@@ ings , no further actu@@ ator or contro@@ l@@ lo@@ id , just a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the inner living so much so it can fly as stable and move into space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the h@@ edge . to bring it to the flies , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ eli@@ hood to throw it right when all of me watch , is low , therefore I will show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasures , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this passage ?
they see that it is not balanced .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; by doing this , he receives the excellent ability , &quot;
moving in space into all directions no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rotating .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of inter@@ active rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest is learned directly at the fly . &quot;
let &apos;s see ourselves that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliably . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue the machine further if restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by half a flight .
the last demonstration is studied synthetic y@@ ness .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we participated in the commercial Micro squares -- every single individual weighs less than a wheels bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space they are and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine da dr@@ au@@ ce wants to be a flying lamp at Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the sal@@ ary is in development and creativity .
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; over 1.3 billion years ago , there was two black holes in a very distant galax@@ y in a very distant galax@@ y . &quot;
these short moments sh@@ aded they bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but your energy still put it free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been given into space @-@ time fabric and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events first in time .
1.3 billion years ago had already been a multi @-@ piece life on Earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has learned a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , men and -- God is standing at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; approximately 25 years ago , a group decided to build a group special -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ Tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which emerge approximately through col@@ li@@ atory black holes . &quot;
most of them stopped for crazy .
&quot; but enough people called it as mad geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation contributed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much har@@ ter work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LI@@ GO could be significantly improved , resulting in the detection service enormously . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is called Advanced LI@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO was started for a final test run to clear some minor , persistent issues . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two Colom@@ bian black holes through the earth . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all of what I had worked for , is no longer science @-@ f@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ at@@ ories such as LI@@ GO measurable signals . however , what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a mu@@ til@@ ation in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; during the pass , the wave will be stretched and its entire content into a direction is stretched and into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , faculty in courses for the relative theory often have a correct al@@ ber@@ th dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched out by the waves of the waves and stopped . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 Dar@@ um , one declared the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that is absurd , would have to be measured precisely in less than a thous@@ and@@ ah of the radius of an atomic kernel . &quot;
at the end of his classic text above Gra@@ itation
&quot; described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties during the construction of such det@@ ectors are violent . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are fin@@ ely and with the support of the public , certainly all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott claims , LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial lifts , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite handy . because so you can create a picture or map of things by using the light of several points of light around you .
with tones is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things to make you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child about .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties such as sound position and height , rhythm and volume to make the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drummer Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make any simple pictures of objects in the space building .
&quot; but by taking note of changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for LI@@ GO are the frequencies of the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave @-@ pattern into s@@ all , we can hear the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; the engra@@ ving to listen , can tell us about much about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rot@@ ate holes , circul@@ ates simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turning the two body very quickly you hear the same p@@ ant@@ elop@@ es with an additional sound change . that sounds so on : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a sort of movement set up in the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LI@@ GO conclusions : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Ballet &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows what he has to hear , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let us think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
it is the constant meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO opens up a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can see -- practical or basically -- not seen .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ cot stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about everything .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes occur however at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers from iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I would definitely see the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the jungle is covered by its own fl@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; with the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , and of which we have never seen any notion . things we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found equal in the first sight of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , the black holes bring forth , such as LI@@ GO they observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to be the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO offers us a completely different angle on events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and p@@ aves of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new Observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than the ur@@ b@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tasted an experiment .
one year I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I feared .
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous to tell me in unpleasant situations , I have to say &quot; yes &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a mad thing happened : exactly what I feared , I feared my fear . &quot;
&quot; to keep my fear , speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , that my life deeply changed , on a unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , called for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; sheep , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kitt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ alley . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me whether I could play with her , when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; of a new attitude in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play with them , once you ask me to ask for . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; fast . I am not perfect , but I felt very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side @-@ effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; YES &quot; say to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am writer . I think things out is awake to life .
dream @-@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream @-@ job .
I create TV . I am producing television .
I make television in a large style .
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
every shipment has hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a television sets can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days with four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four hours TV , three transmis@@ sions , simultaneously in production , four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series run on Thursday on Thursday night .
all over the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I themselves created themselves , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the fire and share my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot;
do you know who that is still doing ?
&quot; nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream @-@ job .
I would like to impress you with that .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re talking about a company , a country or a household , take me seriously when I am saying , I understand that I don &apos;t just get on the computer , and f@@ antasi@@ es , and it is true when I say , I don &apos;t understand it &apos;s dream of dream . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work is always creating a land out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , as I set troops on , as m@@ old I on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as bear@@ able , you have a high sound , delivered a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a bustling street , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people take part , when I &apos;m giving them the sums I write about writing , that writing me joy . &quot;
do not understand me wrong , that does it do . &quot;
&quot; but the bu@@ zz -- when I began to work and work with television production , when I began to work and work and work , I discovered this matter , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz ! &quot;
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you can not strive differently from the size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different , as according to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is genius .
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure and I just know that I love the sums .
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more hibernation , the more work there , the more things there , the more read me , the more you write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I managed , the marathon , I run , the army , the lin@@ nen , the high note , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the sums .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stops .
&quot; revised , over@@ claimed , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the bu@@ zz stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working titles . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my j@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; shame , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Country . &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are a baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums have stopped . &quot;
the sums of the engine hid .
I loved my job no more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours three days , passed weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ment , no rep@@ ent@@ ment , there is not on , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sums I was .
&quot; so what makes you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly bl@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some like think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ le you out , bl@@ ew the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do what you do is doing a teacher to be a son , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and this gives one of the bu@@ zz , when one knew the bu@@ zz , when the bu@@ zz stops , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart h@@ ears , I can survive in the silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states &apos; wa@@ it@@ ress is asking me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ est thou play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say No to myself being aware of two things :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; shame . &quot; &quot;
they call no more &quot; sheep . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I betra@@ yed it if I am Titan and my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ est thou play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this , nothing special . &quot;
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and absence of the Sum@@ mens , I can do nothing but to match . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country , which I am making the marathon , the I run , the army , the high note - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , w@@ edge @-@ cut and the song in which it &apos;s going to leave , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Eis@@ k@@ gin &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me replaces him .
a mental door goes up and a energy shift comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let us stay in the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the Tit@@ an@@ men , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself through broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is not power and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on the love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from life .
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums ign@@ ores the pressure of the story , the expected tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ per@@ ed me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan Poker ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , a lot more love . &quot;
once my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
I make this a permanent rule so I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any guilt .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to listen to the sums . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; do not play away from scratch , just as working . &quot;
the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I am rather at work at the workplace .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person would rather work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we sail@@ ed around in the garden , and back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we singing and play ball .
we cr@@ ashing soap @-@ rab@@ bits .
&quot; I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I am always looking for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe ful@@ fills me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped using games ? &quot;
you can also say it ! let them always then yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child can find less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my babies want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they make sure they want something else . &quot;
&quot; these are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Marien@@ k@@ äfer or K@@ ek replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ y @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need it not . &quot;
everybody can get 15 minutes on the piece by yourself on a s@@ real @-@ mood day !
15 minutes at the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children made ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . we do not have to be the children . it is true to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it is not about playing with your children . it is about pleasure
to play the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out it and keep it up .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I victory . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes at the piece why not full 15 minutes treat yourself ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I am not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown melody , she filled me and my soul . she moves me to new ideas . I don &apos;t miss it to his way and I love my job again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I do not love it . &quot;
I need it not .
I am not the bu@@ zz of the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap @-@ rab@@ bits and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sum .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is a sn@@ ap that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and for more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land that I make , the marathon that I run , the troops , the sums , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the right sums : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , bare , bare and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz the more I know who I am .
I am writer . I think things out ; I awake you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said , &quot; yes &quot; to less work and for more games . &quot;
tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical procedure .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was surgical procedure surg@@ eries .
what is a Func@@ tional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; deep @-@ stag stimulation &quot; . &quot; it impl@@ anted by a electric de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson suff@@ ers who suffered severe cit@@ ations and severe pain .
Neuro@@ modul@@ ation however does not mean ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with something help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was holding super@@ visor and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I sent patients with sk@@ ull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ ma .
&quot; you have to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain is da@@ wned and of sk@@ ull pressure . &quot;
save life you have to decrease the cran@@ ial pressure .
&quot; therefore , one sometimes have to remove a part of the brain &apos;s brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the bra@@ ised brain , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a gun , comparable to very small children that can be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts to search it Jean @-@ François .
this was what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a regular cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ ology lessons that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain has regular cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mor@@ tal .
but these cells blocked different .
they slowly spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like a stem cells , but was different in different ways . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our large @-@ stag cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations near brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing allows . &quot;
that was what we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non@@ lingu@@ istic field , and then to cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François . &quot;
and they are then im@@ mor@@ tal to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we have rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed it to the det@@ ach@@ ment of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transpl@@ ant - Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we irrit@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue di@@ pl@@ ating ? and what will happen if we irrit@@ ate the same cells in sw@@ allowed bra@@ in@@ tissues ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared again , they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we will find a violation and rei@@ m@@ bled exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ bled .
&quot; evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we are colored in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
can these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we practise monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take feed @-@ pell@@ ets by a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we have reached the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex range in mot@@ oric cor@@ tex sectors . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen at people , they recovered spont@@ aneously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plas@@ tic bra@@ ins . they recover at a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see the monkeys , who recovered spont@@ aneously . &quot;
it can provide approximately 40 % to 50 % of its original power from a violation .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
&quot; now you see , when we entic@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ zing them and later use them .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream still is to impl@@ ant them in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal itself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at people . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kil@@ ograms of paper and forms to run these kinds of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to look for the start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes , until someone can come into hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to select patients , to carry out treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply to a multi @-@ centr@@ alised study . &quot;
one must first real@@ ises that it is useful before going to offer this treatment every one .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we are making a great mistake to look at it as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which it is in reality , but as a invent@@ ories of our society . &quot;
we tend to see them as un@@ changeable enemy .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains entirely non @-@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is about us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my Ascen@@ ded friends that would be repeated to me if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I want to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a real and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies become common , our future are dark , and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of wast@@ age , I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction , which is currently being threatened by our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; tw@@ ins &quot; Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we are all recognizing the debt , &quot;
&quot; however , a few recognize his co@@ Di@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cas@@ hes , which is too anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and bring income with which you need to carry the school@@ den@@ berg and also produce all things that mankind is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past three months , in the United States , England and the eurozone took hold of 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars , in all of the prosperity producing goods , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars sound a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion dollars , which at the same time had been around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; debts and un@@ productive capital are the tw@@ ins of the tw@@ ins , which do not affect the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they would not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus &apos;s father , that would be true that his son would kill him , if he will grow , &quot;
&quot; un@@ oll@@ ent the circumstances bring about , that lead him killing him . &quot;
this is my ha@@ ired with capitalism --
&quot; its exc@@ eed@@ ingly co@@ ar@@ quit@@ ous art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we continue : what do we understand by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government .
ath@@ en@@ ous democracy closed off course too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to de@@ vise the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these terms . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they gave the working arms , not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting wei@@ ghting in questions of the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long held --
&quot; like a candle , which glo@@ wed very light , it is also quickly f@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , the Gl@@ orious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately prev@@ ailed for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process was adopted upon policy , while the economy -- thus the world of corporations - a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our modern democr@@ acies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , a lack of struggle between the two instead of turning the economy to politics and depri@@ ved them . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer as they are in the past ?
it is not located at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because we can be in the government today , and yet not in power , because the power of politics is weak@@ ened in the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ ired with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which is so sustainable the animals , of which they nour@@ ished and dec@@ im@@ ated that they are hungry at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy , which led the policy so far that it grows by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is increasing , the inequality rising , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the waste of human labour power , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and economy back and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control control , just like in the antique Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left did this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t quite good .
&quot; the teaching of the Deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : the working arms do !
capitalism does it by replacing kidney power@@ lessness through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the Twin Towers will be higher , and the social conflicts deeper , and the social conflicts deeper , as it will be very soon as I believe -- in countries like China is coming . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re @-@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and in doing so we consider the re @-@ focused area , otherwise we end in a disease hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that leaves the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements , which he brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a D@@ yst@@ eine , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in the machines the people serve and people in the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
so what does it matter how could it look to have these &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to name you shortly , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : ask for a capital market , where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all revenues come from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no num@@ b@@ bing more between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and fuel , and ultimately no em@@ l@@ ative tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a Universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in the interest of the whole of humankind . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade in this currency will be tr@@ aded -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the merch@@ ant of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; also imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment means are r@@ ar . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at the time there was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which they are privileged people , and Marxist , because they are buried the separation of capital and work in the mut@@ ini@@ qui@@ ties of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , global key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we reconc@@ ile into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to work politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... doing this not , technological development will generate such a massive decline of economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , so I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are at ease . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think from the point of view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have a form of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I may say that as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China appeared today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- Do you remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s an error , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical that concerns the democratic development .
&quot; what you can watch now in China , resem@@ bles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; in China now , trying to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , smells like hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers curious about your experience as a financial Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suppose that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing , as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely urge us to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the di@@ gest denial made that a massive del@@ usion line went through the euro zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened with the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- that inci@@ dentally , the first proposal was , which revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the Euro group , continued the denial of denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are trying to get an economic system that is not viable , going through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a tense situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the largest error was to sign the application for an extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the don@@ ors to find a joint solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to fall just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the aud@@ itors , which were occupied by the Eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have conducted a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for five years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika of don@@ ors who have imposed us this policy , and one : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive ch@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolute .
my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my main fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot;
&quot; for if it does not survive , the acqu@@ itted flow forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disast@@ rous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we admit ourselves to the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to be , it will also be as bear@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ European . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price , most of Roy never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is conduc@@ tivity at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has a snack @-@ term and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because it is responsible for making shows and content to produce the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very tough sector . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right at this turn . &quot;
this turn is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this assessment .
&quot; will show your show with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; that are shows like &quot; breaking bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- &quot; The Wire &quot; -- &quot; all the shows , the addi@@ ctive , where , after having a season , your brain asks , &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at that end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you have already needs special intelligence to submit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he does more thoughts about the mean exc@@ itation , the average TV -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire . &quot;
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , therefore Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode each of these shows and presents them online , where everyone can watch free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon will come out for free things , you still attack , right ? &quot;
millions of spect@@ ators look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show when you p@@ auses , which parts you can ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
collect millions of data to determine with this data then what show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results the answer and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of them remember this show because she was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this turn 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7,5 -- therefore something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just as Roy , he is always searching for this a super show and it also uses data for it , but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team have looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find these small details about the spect@@ ators : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; receives a 9,@@ 1 rating on this corner . thus exactly where they wanted . &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic came somehow that it should work in all .
&quot; when you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should meet a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimized it through very powerful computer .
&quot; the minus , what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis so does not work , then this is something start@@ ling because we are living in a time where we can take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
&quot; none . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever get in touch with this software . come with it in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail in the United States and ask for dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismis@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always the best results are generated , that &apos;s not always that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot;
even the data rever@@ ber@@ able companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 Google announced that they can say thanks to data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the sm@@ lim@@ men way , -- by data analysis of the Google &apos;s research test . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success det@@ oxi@@ fy in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just year round , until there is suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply wasn &apos;t working , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life a -- at work , in the enforcement of law , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have known some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first , you place this problem into its parts , so you can analyze the parts ; as a second , you put the parts back together to write a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things to take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suited to reset the parts once again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to come together again , even if the information is incomplete , especially when the brain is of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful , because they have data and mind where they went up in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what else could not have been able to do . but the decision how to put all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; that does not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon also did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used to control all their choices , first as they w@@ ander about TV @-@ ideas as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a Show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they always could say , &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is fairly useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the tool for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no problem you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will be able to do it later with a technology .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions made in my life , where I should have been hearing in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you of course know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it through something much cl@@ oned , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the building .
&quot; perhaps the ball is kl@@ ash and cl@@ ever@@ er , and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging message that in spite of the large amount of data you still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
