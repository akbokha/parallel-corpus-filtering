<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard from Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he is spectacular that the NSA had illegally heard illegonone of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, where the CIA had literally draft an atomic bomb for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter does not know at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been determined and called upon it to call its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn it became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn whistleblowers and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional constitutional media, the media have the right to post secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"however, it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so, when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter had already done before him, he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were for years of indications that it would be indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters can always hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of fail and rake to the statements, this could also carry out its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators have concerned without his consent, his phone-wise secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his email data, financial and banking information, its credit office, and even frills with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to be Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblowers and risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised at his arrival, to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has more condemned than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much from their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers at a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional commitments, because the government has more possibilities to spose all the uttering."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"while they can take it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the testimony."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that had not yet been written as revenge, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source code system for whistleblowers which was originally developed by the internet most famous Aaron Swartz, and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like those of the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can send documents uploading or send information, just like your usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only the respective news agency have access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot spreaded more information secretly, and many of the information they would require, would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that meet all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to ensure that not only technology denominator, like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to zoom misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to report about abnormalities in the care of soldiers and want to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for the sighing water of Flint suggests. or a Wallstreet-insider that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the largest data collection of history was published.] [the" Panama Papers "," [what does that mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does it mean?] [we bates Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] [what does this</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mosbags Fonseca and say," okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we really see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that an association of the brutal Syrian dictators Baschar al-Assad Briefing firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is asserted that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next publication, and upon the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Well it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John-Grisham-brand.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to be crying from you, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their assets, and to devouring -- something that we have been discussing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seems very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I am always present to me like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports of this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there has not been a prominent American in these revelations, this scandal. "</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle according to which these tax havens work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"we would have a datleck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US countries you need less information to specify less information to start a company than to get a reference certificate."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this kind of transparency in the US has allowed the employees of schoolbork, leaving school children."</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all affects us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered revival in the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our awakened gave himself as a African Minister, the suspected money to the US, to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked that all up to a lawyer from our investigations, how he could transverse his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preached preaching. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course anyone had handed over money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single waste.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has undergone our covert proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top leaders in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to deal with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules in order to make this kind of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very much dimess, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the last few years we have seen pre-violations of more transparency, which affects the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU in central stops at national level, who really lies behind firms in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill of law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress that we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headfirms."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy to stand up and say," intransparent is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work for it through laws that end this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finish the intransparent, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"that is the story, as I am nearly discouraged, and in the trunk of a red Mazet would be yellowed."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard."</seg>
<seg id="98">"there was one type in the red Mazda, and looked at my things."</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you want today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him just before! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Macedonian!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard myself:" "I have a ballot. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I turned into the blanket and thought," Oh husband! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildly in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I rose out of the bed, on toe-pointed to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he had bought from me, is in his classroom. he is now teachers."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as strangers, actually friends, who were only waiting for being discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people sitting on my airmattresses, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="123">"take a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, fast, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can make it happen to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have survived as we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer-bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, in addition a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast "[AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars at the air mattresses on woodcrafts.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure our cheese-ham-Omelet tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we stayed with them through the whole city. as we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell, starched Brian and I met."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommates, Nate Plate arczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website, on people publicly post photos of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visit come. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can invite wild foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket would be disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody who is still very consolation, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can get on the things that you can see. we could designen."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just look and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design, among people who never had ever met."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a cost test what degree trust we do.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unfinished mobile phone in your left seating area.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly journey of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what you will feel when she opened the first time the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unfinished mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just now, who does actually have Al Gores cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce that he can announce the position of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have been introduced once, with its name; if he told where he comes, how his dog or his children would like to be called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 assessments that all say: "it can really hold very well unfinished handys!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you'd like to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-left feedback system reinforces the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we still have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">"it was hard for the people, to give negative appraisals."</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both the host and guest had given their appraisals before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we examined a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and home."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is what you add to the call of a person -- in our case through evidence departments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three divisions, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we rode that trust is dependent on how much you are doing."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reaction to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells about too little as" "Hi!" "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you are saying much, as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- "I am not accepted the request."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, such as" "topping art works in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create design with design this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">"we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics one should write something."</seg>
<seg id="193">"our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices towards foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not expect, was the great multitude of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people are entitled to our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need, which had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is currently very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are non-allowed parties celebrated or dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it is already hurting if I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">"disappointment that you hear in the voice of the invoicing, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, a fraction of the 123 million spent nights only a fraction of the problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted one another to law.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, there can be no wonder."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who are tidded due to sitting activities at heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save one life, even though they do not know anything."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive a car in the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay will run.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transforms are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this term I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just a" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, the human relationship promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves openly and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is compared with Fast Food and it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place one would have visited, a group of Answer would wait to fill a thoroughly and one with a pub tour of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to organize apartments from the ground up to one side?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have to share the thought of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and deportation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in Southern Coreas capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking, who belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now ships were offered. students, who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were given to people whose children were educated. there have been incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. about our platform alone today will be 785 000 people in 191 countries as a guest of a foreigner or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinstall the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has exactly our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the astounding:</seg>
<seg id="251">Downward overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"I have to think about it, if a red Mazda is passing by me."</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us when it had this great influence, I ask myself what we can soon be able to use design."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed to underwear a brain-underwear?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look as look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not talk to their polls drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee-owner -- doubling espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möller-Fitness-Fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, Baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided on this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met my decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, such as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I chose to wear the hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were kidnapped: "why do you oppressed you yourself?</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, and indeed opposite the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed in the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, was placed in question, desperate and believed ultimately."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with any reading of the corans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I realize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever feel that somebody takes you truly, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning occurred in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had ended up at the end, looked on the screen and looked at the word" breaking news. "</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flown in buildings, people spill from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned fast to indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists"... "..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Jihad...", "... Zerbombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it was not only attacked my country, but in the Nu turned the deeds of others from a civil war to a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the United States to draw in a new city and start learning in learning."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove -- as we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment in our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" "be vigilant," "lead in well illuminated areas," "sampled you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then there was Friday in that week -- the day, at which Muslims meet for prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of this.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were misunderstandably, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who held for Muslims, into free, and smote for Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people who had attacked this land, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I swept the wut of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing about questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">Those are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to serve Muslims and mourn.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour one is as a whole and a benign tumour one thinks only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, creators, and Olympioniks."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there might be a few parking spaces, but do not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to show people to other faith tolerant, and larger citizen participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told us: people are indeed not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the radicalization process has been noticed that he can cut online. as a first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the person believes that terrorists are true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology, is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still affirm that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS produces its brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslim, as mother, as a mother, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves to their imagination, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1,6 billion faithful."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups maintain their ideology reasons in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you have a look at it, it is not driving what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit with whom she spoke, she brought her to silence, and told her that their anger, her sense of injustice in the world, they would only bring into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that could have been given to their anger, it was a main objective for the instrumentalisation by the extremists that gave it a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam presented the connection to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accused her for her anger, he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, keep them to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy from our thinking?</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show, if we fear, pass at least three things."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are accepting a authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if you have reported test people, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an akademistic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood against Muslims came to the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the preparation of Iraq war and during two constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to cut out the foundation of a free society, which has sensible and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is a breakfast sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it perhaps as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in assignment of collective blame, it is not just about to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was ented at the dental faculty, talented, much promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous man, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is out of my brotherhood, such a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razanj that was in the afternoon when he was posted there by Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He foss eight times in Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism may not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or were we staying safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we had it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we left to our children: one that would be able to control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, took my shoes off, went into the prayer shalle, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made a notice, bedbled himself and was welcome our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who were not to join us but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudices had.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you choosing at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or join the ones that mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for Basler, it is about to be a billion euro business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats. possible, this is made in research institutes worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air upsetting in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six metre high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">Through interlocking aviation high speed and acceleration in the narrowest room.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-confident structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"you have learned to wear the loads, deal with turmoil and generally react on natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to operate a system autonomous, it must know collective complacces, where in the space the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamical tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an integer of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands is available at the highest Ebene. e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a socalled rear-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a plane, which tries to hit two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most of the starters, it is fluctuate, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedging is that they are sensitively react to turmoil like wind-boil.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airplane doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be regained and the performance by practicing can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often present fundamental abstract issues that are at the heart of the cause."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, such a question would be: what is the small number of movable parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, which work together to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained airplanes could fly televous aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate."</seg>
<seg id="435">"we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest TV-served plane. it was invented recently. "</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clapping, hinges and crossings, no further actuator or controlloid, just a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the inner living so much so it can fly as stable and move into space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hedge. to bring it to the flies, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it right when all of me watch, is low, therefore I will show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is an exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this passage?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by doing this, he receives the excellent ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space into all directions no matter what direction it is rotated or even how it rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellants."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest is learned directly at the fly."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see ourselves that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliably."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue the machine further if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by half a flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is studied synthetic yness.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated in the commercial Micro squares -- every single individual weighs less than a wheels bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space they are and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine da drauce wants to be a flying lamp at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the salary is in development and creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">"the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the icing on the cake."</seg>

<seg id="469">"over 1.3 billion years ago, there was two black holes in a very distant galaxy in a very distant galaxy."</seg>
<seg id="470">These short moments shaded they brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But your energy still put it free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been given into space-time fabric and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events first in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago had already been a multi-piece life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has learned a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, men and -- God is standing at -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"approximately 25 years ago, a group decided to build a group special -- Rai Weiss from MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever of CalTech -- a huge laser detector to look for gravitational-waves, which emerge approximately through colliatory black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people called it as mad geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation contributed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much harter work they built the Detector LIGO: the laser-Interferometer- gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could be significantly improved, resulting in the detection service enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was started for a final test run to clear some minor, persistent issues."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two Colombian black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all of what I had worked for, is no longer science-fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. however, what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a mutilation in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"during the pass, the wave will be stretched and its entire content into a direction is stretched and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, faculty in courses for the relative theory often have a correct alberth dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched out by the waves of the waves and stopped. the elongation of an average human being was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1 Darum, one declared the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and that is absurd, would have to be measured precisely in less than a thousandah of the radius of an atomic kernel."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text above Graitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described KIP Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are violent. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are finely and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles are overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO is more a ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial lifts, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because so you can create a picture or map of things by using the light of several points of light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things to make you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties such as sound position and height, rhythm and volume to make the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "drummer Bob." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make any simple pictures of objects in the space building.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by taking note of changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO are the frequencies of the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave-pattern into sall, we can hear the universe literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the engraving to listen, can tell us about much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotate holes, circulates simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly you hear the same pantelopes with an additional sound change. that sounds so on: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement set up in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO conclusions: [Surrendes Ballet] Jemand, who knows what he has to hear, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which turn around as fast as the sticks of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">It is the constant meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO opens up a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can see -- practical or basically -- not seen.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why mascot stars in super-novae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about everything.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes occur however at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers from iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. the Urbang: I would definitely see the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the jungle is covered by its own flashes."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, and of which we have never seen any notion. things we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found equal in the first sight of things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, the black holes bring forth, such as LIGO they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to be the Saurierknochen for our archeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO offers us a completely different angle on events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and paves of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the urbang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tasted an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year I would say to everything "Yes!" I was afraid of which I feared.</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter whether it made me nervous to tell me in unpleasant situations, I have to say" yes "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a mad thing happened: exactly what I feared, I feared my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"to keep my fear, speeches, my social anxiety -- puff."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes, that my life deeply changed, on a unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, called for inexplicable reasons all" sheep, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-alley."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me whether I could play with her, when I was on the go. and I said," yes. "</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"of a new attitude in my family. from there I swear to play with them, once you ask me to ask for. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"fast. I am not perfect, but I felt very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side-effect: only recently I understood that the "YES" say to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am writer. I think things out is awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream-job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream-job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I am producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television in a large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment has hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television sets can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days with four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four hours TV, three transmissions, simultaneously in production, four episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series run on Thursday on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I themselves created themselves, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the fire and share my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream-job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would like to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard if you're talking about a company, a country or a household, take me seriously when I am saying, I understand that I don't just get on the computer, and fantasies, and it is true when I say, I don't understand it's dream of dream."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always creating a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, as I set troops on, as mold I on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as bearable, you have a high sound, delivered a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a bustling street, I could always go on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take part, when I'm giving them the sums I write about writing, that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that does it do. "</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I began to work and work with television production, when I began to work and work and work, I discovered this matter, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, you can not strive differently from the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different, as according to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not made for failure and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more hibernation, the more work there, the more things there, the more read me, the more you write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I managed, the marathon, I run, the army, the linnen, the high note, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overclaimed, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working titles."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my janny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" shame, I want to go to Shonda Country. "</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums have stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine hid.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my job no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours three days, passed weekends, no repentment, no repentment, there is not on, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what makes you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly bladed?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some like think:" "Heule you out, blew the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do what you do is doing a teacher to be a son, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and this gives one of the buzz, when one knew the buzz, when the buzz stops, who is then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart hears, I can survive in the silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states' waitress is asking me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late, and she says," Mama, magest thou play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say No to myself being aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not" shame. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "sheep."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I betrayed it if I am Titan and my buzz, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, magest thou play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">"this, nothing special."</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "Everybody Poops." ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and absence of the Summens, I can do nothing but to match."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I am making the marathon, the I run, the army, the high note - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wedge-cut and the song in which it's going to leave, or whatever the girl in" The Eiskgin "." "</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me replaces him.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and a energy shift comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working environment, the Titanmen, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself through broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not power and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of the story, the expected tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps he whispered me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan Poker?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, a lot more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a permanent rule so I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice unless I want to listen to the sums."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"do not play away from scratch, just as working."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt, "</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I am rather at work at the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a person would rather work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we sailed around in the garden, and back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We singing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crashing soap-rabbits.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always looking for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped using games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let them always then yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a dreamer. "</seg>
<seg id="742">"you have probably right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child can find less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my babies want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they make sure they want something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"these are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or Kek replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teeny-daughter whole 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more need it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can get 15 minutes on the piece by yourself on a sreal-mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children made ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. we do not have to be the children. it is true to feel the buzz, to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your children. it is about pleasure</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it up.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I victory. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to meet myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes at the piece why not full 15 minutes treat yourself?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my free time. the buzz seems to return when I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, she filled me and my soul. she moves me to new ideas. I don't miss it to his way and I love my job again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I need it not.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz of the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap-rabbits and sticky fingers, dinner with friends. "</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is a snap that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and for more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land that I make, the marathon that I run, the troops, the sums, the buzz, the buzz, the right sums: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, bare, bare and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this buzz the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am writer. I think things out; I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said," yes "to less work and for more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was surgical procedure surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a Functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most known, the" deep-stag stimulation "." it implanted by a electric de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves. "</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson suffers who suffered severe citations and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was holding supervisor and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I sent patients with skull-brain-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you have to imagine that at skull-brain traumas, the brain is dawned and of skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="815">Save life you have to decrease the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">"therefore, one sometimes have to remove a part of the brain's brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the braised brain, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a gun, comparable to very small children that can be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts to search it Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This was what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a regular cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biology lessons that stem cells unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has regular cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells blocked different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like a stem cells, but was different in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our large-stag cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"at the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing allows."</seg>
<seg id="850">That was what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the nonlinguistic field, and then to cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are then immortal to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we have reimbursed it to the detachment of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant - Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we irritate these cells in normal brain tissue diplating? and what will happen if we irritate the same cells in swallowed braintissues?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared again, they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we will find a violation and reimbled exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimbled.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we are colored in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we practise monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed-pellets by a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we have reached the motoric cortex range in motoric cortex sectors."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen at people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brains. they recover at a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left you see the monkeys, who recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide approximately 40% to 50% of its original power from a violation.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now you see, when we enticed the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freezing them and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at people."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms to run these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to look for the start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes, until someone can come into hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to select patients, to carry out treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply to a multi-centralised study."</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first realises that it is useful before going to offer this treatment every one.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we are making a great mistake to look at it as a matter of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as a inventories of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to see them as unchangeable enemy.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its great imitators in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains entirely non-democratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is about us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my Ascended friends that would be repeated to me if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I want to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a real and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies become common, our future are dark, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of wastage, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction, which is currently being threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twins" Paradox. "</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we are all recognizing the debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">"however, a few recognize his coDior."</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cashes, which is too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and bring income with which you need to carry the schooldenberg and also produce all things that mankind is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past three months, in the United States, England and the eurozone took hold of 3.4 trillion dollars, in all of the prosperity producing goods, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billions US dollars sound a lot of money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which at the same time had been around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"debts and unproductive capital are the twins of the twins, which do not affect the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they would not invest. just like Oedipus's father, that would be true that his son would kill him, if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unollent the circumstances bring about, that lead him killing him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haired with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its exceedingly coarquitous art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue: what do we understand by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Athenous democracy closed off course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to devise the significance of athenic democracy due to these terms."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the athenian democracy was and is that they gave the working arms, not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voting weighting in questions of the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not long held --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glowed very light, it is also quickly faded."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, the Glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately prevailed for the ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process was adopted upon policy, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations - a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our modern democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, a lack of struggle between the two instead of turning the economy to politics and deprived them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer as they are in the past?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because we can be in the government today, and yet not in power, because the power of politics is weakened in the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haired with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about like a flock of carnivores, which is so sustainable the animals, of which they nourished and decimated that they are hungry at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy, which led the policy so far that it grows by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is increasing, the inequality rising, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the waste of human labour power, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and economy back and it would be better if the" Demos "control control, just like in the antique Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left did this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn't quite good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching of the Debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working arms do!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing kidney powerlessness through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the Twin Towers will be higher, and the social conflicts deeper, and the social conflicts deeper, as it will be very soon as I believe -- in countries like China is coming."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to re-shape the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and in doing so we consider the re-focused area, otherwise we end in a disease hyperautocracy that leaves the film" matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements, which he brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a Dysteine, similar to the" matrix "," in the machines the people serve and people in the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks to the sense of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what does it matter how could it look to have these "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" similar Dystia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to name you shortly, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: ask for a capital market, where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a working place to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all revenues come from capital and from redeeming, and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no numbbing more between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and fuel, and ultimately no emlative twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a Universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging economies], in the interest of the whole of humankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade in this currency will be traded -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"also imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment means are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at the time there was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunited policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you is at the same time liberating, in which they are privileged people, and Marxist, because they are buried the separation of capital and work in the mutiniquities of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we reconcile into a "matrix" - similar Dystia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to work politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... doing this not, technological development will generate such a massive decline of economic demand that Larry Summers is called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, so I am a libertary Marxist, and as Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect."</seg>

<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have a form of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I may say that as provocative, China appeared today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- Do you remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that's an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical that concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can watch now in China, resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"in China now, trying to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells like hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners curious about your experience as a financial Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suppose that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, as we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro zone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely urge us to say goodbye to the complacency, and the digest denial made that a massive delusion line went through the euro zone, and continues to be massively threatened with the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- that incidentally, the first proposal was, which revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the euro area, within the Euro group, continued the denial of denial."</seg>

<seg id="1011">"if you are trying to get an economic system that is not viable, going through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure.</seg>

<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The largest error was to sign the application for an extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the donors to find a joint solution.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price, most of Roy never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductivity at Amazon Studios, "</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has a snack-term and describes on Twitter as" "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because it is responsible for making shows and content to produce the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very tough sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right at this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This turn is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will show your show with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"that are shows like" breaking bath, "" Game of Thrones "," "The Wire" -- "The Wire" -- "all the shows, the addictive, where, after having a season, your brain asks," where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at that end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you have already needs special intelligence to submit" Toddlers and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he does more thoughts about the mean excitation, the average TV -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, therefore Roy Price doesn't want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode each of these shows and presents them online, where everyone can watch free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon will come out for free things, you still attack, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show when you pauses, which parts you can skip or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">Collect millions of data to determine with this data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results the answer and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican U.S. Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of them remember this show because she was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this turn 7,4 is and Alpha House landet at 7,5 -- therefore something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just as Roy, he is always searching for this a super show and it also uses data for it, but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team have looked at the available data on the Netflix viewer, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find these small details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards "." Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons. "</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" receives a 9,1 rating on this corner. thus exactly where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic came somehow that it should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should meet a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimized it through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the minus, what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis so does not work, then this is something startling because we are living in a time where we can take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"none. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever get in touch with this software. come with it in touch, you are in prison. "</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always the best results are generated, that's not always that a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data reverberable companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009 Google announced that they can say thanks to data analysis outbreaks of flu, the smlimmen way, -- by data analysis of the Google's research test."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success detoxify in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just year round, until there is suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply wasn't working, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life a -- at work, in the enforcement of law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather ensure that data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have known some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a first, you place this problem into its parts, so you can analyze the parts; as a second, you put the parts back together to write a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things to take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suited to reset the parts once again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to come together again, even if the information is incomplete, especially when the brain is of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore I think I was Netflix so successful, because they have data and mind where they went up in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what else could not have been able to do. but the decision how to put all these parts again and make it a show like" "House of Cards", "that does not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon also did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used to control all their choices, first as they wander about TV-ideas as they chose" Alpha House "as a Show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they always could say," "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is fairly useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the tool for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no problem you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be able to do it later with a technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions made in my life, where I should have been hearing in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it through something much cloned, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball is klash and cleverer, and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging message that in spite of the large amount of data you still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
