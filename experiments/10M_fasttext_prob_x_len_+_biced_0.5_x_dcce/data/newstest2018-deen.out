Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people will meet today .
a tomb which is now founded for the S @-@ Bahn tun@@ nels .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the underlying cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Mün@@ chens supports exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not current .
&quot; this has anyone who had to rain himself , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a tigh@@ tening road showed a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but that is why they are very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
&quot; then it is clear how cities and municipalities will have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r@@ epp@@ i which one cannot recognize as such .
&quot; in the large coverage map , for towns and municipalities were detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheets . &quot;
this emerged according to the information provided by the Bav@@ arian susp@@ ect administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and rel@@ ap@@ ing the first Ver@@ messung .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during World War II coalition with Austria .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographical record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops served with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a surface @-@ covered Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Max IV V. Joseph was driving forward the project further , the &quot; top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische surv@@ ey@@ ing administration . &quot;
the jungle leaf@@ let for Munich dates back to the year 1856 and is like all others to find on the website of the Bav@@ arian State library .
the comparison from early / Today is the state capital of the most impressive .
the town has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was exhibiting for 21 years after the map , thus 1877 , as a Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
today J@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses sub@@ sen@@ dl@@ ings focus at 1856 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of Bavaria against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the west park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when Hin@@ d@@ oom appears a small dis@@ advant@@ aged card with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand in writing number@@ ing Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot;
small plots do not occupy no farmers more - but small g@@ ärt@@ ner of the plant &quot; Land of Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ b of the Oc@@ to@@ ber@@ fes@@ ts , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the jungle leaf@@ let you read in the area of the present district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the stre@@ et@@ name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; On the venti@@ lation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ ves@@ straße , people were once bor@@ dered to people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there was 1858 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard conducted by Gu@@ dden the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ank@@ hing of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; he is also prohibited to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had first been space , later on 500 places has been expanded . &quot;
&quot; sometime , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district it@@ enti@@ ary in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per blade in Germany since 2006 , one of the biggest psychiat@@ ry of Germany . &quot;
on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt we meet young people in Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order is complex in 1920 and walked in a youth @-@ home with an apprentic@@ eship .
&quot; west is the football field of the T@@ SV Munich East , east of the east houses of the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was established in an ar@@ quit@@ ous con@@ du@@ ation to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was in order to be &quot; &quot; Head of Place &quot; , &quot; which was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a big one still remained - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marien@@ hof , where this day was the pre @-@ work and finished on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ aten@@ ating for the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared with the a@@ erial image of today - and fill the hole on the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
civil @-@ laws published in Mis@@ sour@@ i for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the national union on the promotion of color @-@ above has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i on the basis of discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the State according to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a series of frag@@ mentary , rac@@ ed @-@ based inci@@ dents in recent times throughout the state , and can be noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it difficult to win discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ ution bodies of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate to minorities , the group conf@@ isc@@ ated the group , the warning said , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that will happen .
&quot; they are lifted because of their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist corruption against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under frag@@ mentary circumstances beginning of the year after spending during the trip through the state no gas@@ oline , and was taken into custo@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which black drivers in the state will be raised 75 percent more often than past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready if there are Kau@@ tex items or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 h@@ ass@@ ings in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ in@@ bre@@ cht reporting Programme of F@@ BI , which ranks the state in relation to the number of such injury to the 16th ranking of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law which would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; prior to the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) Travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , following the States immigration laws , the local criminal law enforcement authorities commit to rejuven@@ ate people because of immigration violations , which is contributing to the view of the AC@@ LU to the further r@@ attle . &quot;
&quot; trips are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but at the last time stakeholders have been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
subtle project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter White and Kor@@ du@@ la Kov@@ ac have created a picture in front of the town .
&quot; at the right @-@ grab@@ bed of the Family Schwen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ Locations , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann gave first insights into its operation , in which he has operated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows , and also many young animals , and in five apartments are accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black @-@ Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eters for the milk of his cows , so swing . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only comes regional .
&quot; as he is also called BL@@ H@@ V @-@ President of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he describes the &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t work towards such steep areas not profitable .
&quot; the green area is designed for much work , much m@@ ould with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ astic operation and manage these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he has no bio@@ operation . &quot;
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognized the importance of the ordination project and is pleased with the leader promotion . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are would have to support farmers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while . &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thought of how they continue to operate their operations , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion .
over the ordination promotion were fenced in the year 2013 25 plots of eleven participants in 2013 .
&quot; the open surface amounts to 40 hectares , which can not be forced until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half over leaders was promoted , a quarter carried by the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of wheat . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Kor@@ du@@ la Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lady it does not go . &quot;
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; here are best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ aling @-@ coated line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ure .
the goal is the post@@ ure of the bl@@ ur@@ al@@ ds .
a prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed .
&quot; furthermore , the circum@@ fence surface must not be conclusi@@ ve ( Hang@@ ars over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; it is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build fence at almost 16 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the surface area is 35 hectares , the cal@@ orie costs are at more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; now , the White House of Tru@@ mp takes on the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; the safest sign of a regime transfer is it , if they begin to att@@ acking the statues . &quot;
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other , so the car@@ ef@@ ful overthrow Saddam H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he did a symbolic thr@@ ust in a h@@ it@@ ful argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue themselves . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators could have suffered him when he had done it .
&quot; but he took their significance , and especially the meaning that you have been written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta accused , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go here on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly properly correct , but as he herself form@@ ulating , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the sho@@ ok words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only loads any old immigrants , but the sle@@ eves of the poor : &quot; your arrogan@@ t , your poor , / your be@@ aked masses , which are long to breathe , free to breathe the el@@ ty waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; breaking waste &quot; on our screens better was better .
Miller engaged not in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is in fact a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after death on the basis - did very well that they were a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its poem the feminine figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice .
and she himself gives himself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to move from the right wing this long time . &quot;
&quot; the great scre@@ am Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John of the dec@@ essor for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is anyone inv@@ aders , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ Conserv@@ ative , that the American flame is in the converted world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ estone here on something stolen .
the meaning of the statue is entirely and at all a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they were of the depl@@ eted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people , seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever wish to recognise . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
WH@@ C 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises sch@@ ot@@ astic members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the UK team
&quot; the performance @-@ director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member of the World Cup team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland develops something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals to medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team of the team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sh@@ ot@@ tically or wherever they live or train , went out of room and felt very proud and were motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ ie was entirely natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of silver medals , which is going to compete in their fifth world Championships at the 400 m @-@ m barriers , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; is that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven , which have been reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Mu@@ ir runs on this path and has opened five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1.500 m is running , is another so@@ ons which one should be watching after a great season that includes victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first world Championships than the only other flock in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team &apos;s capitals says that they are &quot; huge &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special to be the team of surrender is that they had chosen by the other members of the team , so it &apos;s anyway a great honor to know , but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chose it , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to rise to po@@ e@@ dies . &quot;
what is my speech as chapters ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; it is therefore really important to put it on this hom@@ ein@@ ment and benefit from it , that we are back in the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will just be such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not block you a public office if you do not toler@@ ate the entry of voters
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers sw@@ allow him because of it , from inner policy to his political principles . &quot;
he sh@@ ou@@ ted in criticism .
but he has not brought his critics as silence .
&quot; in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we will be led as the sheep to the battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work on it , to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and have vo@@ iced their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endant him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the path of Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of an intercom with &quot; &quot; Well , and ? &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like h@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can@@ arian governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the second @-@ ranking approval of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he showed a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
&quot; he was also very skill@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary instrument to combine with his voters and deb@@ ating his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy in his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore the block@@ age of persons appearing on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gans spokes@@ man Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argu@@ ed that the movements of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of Tro@@ ll@@ es or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ af@@ filled people , who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders , a teacher , a entrepreneurs and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respectful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyers Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ amp@@ er , but they asked for h@@ ass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to h@@ ass@@ ing and other latest news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary section of the message delivery &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea even if a number of people take place on the same topic , then it will be mis@@ used by some rather than a large collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the people of Govern@@ ors were referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era is easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
it is much clean@@ er than in past time when you had the same thing that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical tails and to burn or burning demonstr@@ ators and to bring prot@@ esters .
but this is exactly happening digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official that he cri@@ tici@@ zed Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is lam@@ ented by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County is last the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they joined a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt has received a visit from the AC@@ LU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the moment , Washington had the time of affordable POR@@ TOS a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters sw@@ allow for his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington was anonymous trou@@ gh .
&quot; the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; petition on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Britain critic@@ ised his office , according to the historic documents produced by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have it swe@@ pt .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and disco@@ urses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty hope in the next three days at home comforts , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an took place on the 25th issue of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led in the last year , in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the final , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , has been linked to the new venue , and acts as a tournament names on behalf of the club @-@ founders and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; said Raf@@ fer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job as he set up this place .
he is a hur@@ ried prop@@ on@@ ents of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , E@@ EA is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won his career in his 32 @-@ year career as well as the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly true , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I could not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it was in the year , after I won it , from the program was taken . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always be appreciated .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf course .
I am glad how it worked .
&quot; with the trio at the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belongs to the six vill@@ i on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with a in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds from Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by Passi@@ ve
over the past two decades less people have died due to passi@@ v@@ ot of lung cancer .
this is the result of scientists of the university hospital in Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates are attri@@ but@@ able per year 167 of lung cancer cases on passive exposure , &quot; said Spe@@ aker Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he went to an own study on this issue of 1994 . &quot;
back then there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive exposure per year in Germany .

home@@ work prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lies somewhat in the times , &quot; so the director of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of hous@@ ings may be the situation more complicated than suspected , as in the underground , much may not be noticed in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic that continues to be disabled again , is a major problem for the building up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to a passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p has been busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but fortunately , we were told by our friend Fritz Matt looked after with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina Deg@@ ree the dinner coo@@ ks , it does not use a stove . &quot;
it even uses rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the panic attack in the un@@ quiet in@@ don@@ esian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the low @-@ cav@@ ity will be extrac@@ ted and dev@@ oured hands after half an hour . &quot;
Deg@@ ei sits on the clay court - she has no furniture - where they also performs their daily work to wash clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as a Lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband you were not assigned any fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : the majority of vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody we@@ bed@@ ding it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hochland of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia as only 1,0@@ 26 elders . &quot;
an existing movement intended for independence against the Dutch rule turned rapidly to the government of Jak@@ arta that holds control over the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal observing of it .
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New gu@@ ine@@ as was encomp@@ ass@@ ed the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning @-@ hour drive with car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with approximately 19.@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses that are surrounded by bamboo , and of cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs , which were converted through r@@ ust in various yellow @-@ brown sounds . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , the Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans was a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ei and points to their vivid , handmade tur@@ ban , its dark shirt and its bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian Province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality rate in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a floo@@ d@@ land in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has reduced gold and copper in 2015 alone in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood@@ resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which is ensuring that Indon@@ esian Army retained a leading military presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local Military Analysis and units of 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars paid , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden g@@ ans and will be mer@@ c@@ efully treated .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal high@@ land in 1970 @-@ years were referred to in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Committee on genocide .
in the region alone the Indon@@ esian police last year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters .
&quot; we make the Every@@ thing &quot; is , in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane taken from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as un@@ law@@ ful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are especially popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week will happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the scre@@ w@@ driving have reinforced since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring resources a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , as Muslim economic migrants are changing from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ons sell s@@ lic@@ ed chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with Erd@@ n@@ nut sauce . &quot;
local people are struggling to hold here .
&quot; the migrants have begun , chickens and vegetables sell on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua for sale , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai local , who moved to the province Capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua , costs their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election in 2014 to address the inequalities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former Zimmermann &apos;s 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai only suffered two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a deep point . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the ro@@ cking children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off on her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had drank , unted , and sm@@ ote the group with their ri@@ fle , they said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard pressed that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building was set by the nearby governmental commission and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua Men , women and children gathered themselves on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military @-@ mand@@ o@@ centre to demand justice . &quot;
they bore a cerem@@ onial hunt @-@ bows and led the sc@@ ita dance - on the circle and a bird @-@ ges@@ tion im@@ i@@ ti@@ ating - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to sl@@ ate stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal Fun@@ k : &quot; if the masses are over three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of T@@ IME who has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for peace and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I revol@@ ved , I suddenly got into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , he said T@@ IME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; the Kay@@ ame always does not know who has folded , but says that the bul@@ let from the ranks of the people gathered here were assembled . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were folded &quot; , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to be certain that he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans just a name , the T@@ IME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the che@@ ek @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Repor@@ ting that his officers only wanted their station to &quot; secure &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others in@@ ju@@ red .
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and vibr@@ ate , address the historical abuse of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that in the future it will no longer happen again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Dis@@ anto &quot; &quot; said in October 2016 that he entered a extrac@@ ting mechanism for the con@@ fes@@ sion of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injury are performed for a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ ers and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that have to run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to T@@ IME on June 5 , in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is governed by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , who has accused the UN for crimes against humanity , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already attached , including the panic attack . &quot;
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims took such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ eving un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in panic attack are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting did not have stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; while a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma which refused to bring an unconscious man into the hospital , died a person and 17 others were in@@ ju@@ red , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , the dro@@ wned , when he conf@@ isc@@ ated in a nearby river died on the way to hospital . &quot;
&quot; ro@@ omm@@ ates vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the office location of the company . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers were stones on officers , who re@@ acted upon them by wet warning . &quot;
but local people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) began to shoot and shoot a dish .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i who lived near the hospital and witness how the latter was quickly delivered here , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I spent two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to hold the participating officials to account and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police in the area .
panic was always an un@@ rest for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful developments strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bes@@ men of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , D@@ ani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green Hochland of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebellion that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by in@@ viol@@ ate spor@@ adi@@ sche attacks and ab@@ duc@@ tions of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guides come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ cat@@ Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in P@@ ani@@ ai in recent years and is arbitr@@ ary confin@@ ement under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; safeguarding of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never appear again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua is P@@ ani@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , for@@ get@@ ful place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for local people . &quot;
bread is just as apart .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women working four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the majority of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces of Not@@ a tasted only 10,000 Indon@@ esian R@@ up@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic inequalities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chair of the Chief Council of P@@ ani@@ ai . &quot;
insulation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the reporting international media remains tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ ll Long@@ ch@@ amp were ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission for films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asian director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign , have been raising the restrictions of reporting , to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian regions of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in March , six Pacific @-@ fish states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widely used injury &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dismis@@ sed the accus@@ ation of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still is a more democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to waste the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the ground want to take note of more foreign governments .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , visited local silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part at the meeting , but to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably will not be back for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the panic attack , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people knows that it is under the constant threat of a Hebrew military , is living in arm@@ our educ@@ ators and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the panic attack , like other Pap@@ ua , who must consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Shi@@ ps made a last symbolic act of the Trotsky@@ ists : the cor@@ pse of a sacrifice was buried in a terrain opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they may know they may never come up justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with healthier head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai through its pain@@ ts@@ book and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is defeated in just two years through the sky@@ scr@@ aper , which is also called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we slept with the fire@@ places , and when scre@@ aming the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to bottom , &quot; &quot; told a resident , which has its name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais Local Auth@@ orities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 hours are GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building . &quot;
&quot; the government said , she work on the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used for questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; a study carried out by the management of the Tor@@ ch building by its fire in 2015 , that most of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , outdoor clothing to decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , she said that the system of plates for insulation and fair@@ ing at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June to have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ ch , where about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis courts ( ITF ) is fed with its Great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the AG@@ M .
&quot; at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the for this sport revolutionary suggestion , Davis Cup single @-@ single was only supported on two winn@@ ings , Hau@@ ch@@ thin are not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although it is often very long , but even so much appreciated Five @-@ sentence classics remain intact to the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for the reform , the target of the ITF @-@ president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; even until the vote was not until the vote , before before , the proposal had come to a neutral place in a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : so the fin@@ alists of the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to have the hosts in the first round in the first round .
&quot; to reduce the costs for the organizer , the demands placed in training sets etc , and the players will have to pass before the Davis Cup less official media events . &quot;
more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings the items in the aircraft to find a survey
&quot; a survey conducted under flight passengers yiel@@ ded that over 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously betra@@ yed items on the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration by jewelry , including at least 6 percent , who conc@@ eive the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally deleted Messer or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed , they could have noticed that they have traveled ir@@ er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - that was conducted by a jet charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also stated that younger travellers rather mis@@ use the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents said that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19,@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which were passing on T@@ SA agents , were food and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent , knowing items with blades supported by the safety control , whereas 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 per cent of the male surveys have also confirmed that they would have taken an inten@@ tional drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , there were travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gling goods would have been brought to the airport security and how many things could have done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that people , the most eh@@ sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ gel@@ ware - kno@@ w@@ ingly or kno@@ w@@ ingly - by the safety , those were the most frequent . &quot;
&quot; however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which liqui@@ ds may take them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA shel@@ tered items covered by the T@@ SA .
&quot; a time long thought the people , the T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ Customer canc@@ eling order
elec@@ tro @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k will be happy with the huge number of pre@@ orders for its new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , it has been under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation again . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the continually tri@@ umph@@ ant figures , the Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has betra@@ yed for the first time a different , lesser numbers : the cancell@@ ations of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
Mus@@ k has often applied more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car over the past few months .
&quot; now , Mus@@ k was a : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders are 63.@@ 000 already back again . &quot;
critics always had to point out that it is just about non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in cancellation , Tes@@ la pays Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ und ) &quot;
&quot; currently annoying 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations in front of , spatial mus@@ k at a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; that the cancellation of so far twelve per cent of all orders might become a problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth aim is not on demand , but on the production side . &quot;
last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles delivered .
&quot; 2018 it should be - all models assembled - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is evident .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , currently each day 1800 reservations are included . &quot;
&quot; who is now ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; should expect early in the second half of 2018 by delivery - if Tes@@ la makes it , his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum relief . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to a larger delays , then the dis@@ connection of the reservations for Tes@@ la could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent un@@ satisfied customers , in Sch@@ ars away . &quot;
EPA manager P@@ ru@@ itt dr@@ au@@ ts itself because of the execution of the rules of the Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after having been w@@ ailed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ des , the chief of the environmental protection authorities , his former decision returned to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era , to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air @-@ minerals . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , as its agency proved to meet the needs of the state @-@ environment authorities , compared to recur@@ r@@ ally faster than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous position in a federal court court .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran off on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ an o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ deb@@ ated in June that he will delay the compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to hin@@ der , &quot; &quot; in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent out of environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ des has repeatedly been repeated , regul@@ ators to block or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the phal@@ ia of regulatory tur@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal court of Washington decided that the EPA administration has exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in an on Wednesday night , P@@ ru@@ des suggested that his turn@@ around at Oz@@ on@@ face was very easy to intensi@@ fy the willingness of EPA in cooperation with the states due to the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA often has the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be charged by activists , and other groups , and in an agreement reached the appointment for the implementation , &quot; P@@ ru@@ des , who negotiated the EPA more than a dozen time in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by jurisdiction , and we take dates seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority which there are , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , the opinion of EPA approved that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually will use his &quot; authority &quot; to delay and all other legal services available to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information is based . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a broader restructuring of the o@@ zone .
a last month approved legislation should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made available in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Office @-@ prosec@@ utor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states who had w@@ ailed the EPA within this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - after our pl@@ agues - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New York and the more than 115 million Americans , which are directly affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; said C@@ utting . &quot;
&quot; new York , in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sylv@@ ania , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone emerg@@ es when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil sp@@ eri@@ as , chemical machinery and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight respond . &quot;
the de@@ composed smo@@ g can cause in sensitive groups of people serious breathing problems and contribute every year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered by a surprising course of course .
&quot; it is worrying how much pressure it takes to obtain this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we inhal@@ ing , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Biological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government , to adapt to the environmental poll@@ uting and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celeb@@ rates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 . July , at 16.@@ 30 at a Seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit seren@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tumor to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique rural village . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in Wür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ qui@@ ebook . &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the church rec@@ tory at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wor@@ ding of the certificate , after the tum@@ our mountain apart from the local church , there was also a terrific courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron saint and not the other way around . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as out of the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still recognizing the &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; the third , the magnificent settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from time around 1600 were under@@ lined that historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ age right was created from the early medieval owner .
&quot; a Lord who built a church , saved and occupied with a priest , continued his owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this peculi@@ ar church too . &quot;
associated with it was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells in the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ bar@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell stand for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in 1942 during the Second World War . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window dis@@ cs were pushed and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ den@@ sely .
17@@ 96 sail@@ ed French troops near the church .
they bra@@ zed the pul@@ pit and church @-@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ wned 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also served as the last resting place for the dead of hearing . &quot;
18@@ 23 the cemetery has been extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche has been abandoned .
only the church tower you can stand .
in the New Year @-@ eight 18@@ 34 a storm killed the church tower and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent an un@@ happiness , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the present turbul@@ ent tower remained intact as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today we cultiv@@ ate Horst K@@ mar@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em by the &quot; Schaf@@ ed pension@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius equipment .
&quot; as a organizer we invite friends and sponsors of tum@@ our on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery of the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Resi@@ denti@@ al Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.30 pm .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to the qu@@ ad of the Seren@@ ade , there is a trunk before the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; place the organis@@ er the fantastic view . &quot;
Seren@@ ade takes place only on dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ lingen and listening . &quot;
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ i feel particularly oblig@@ ated to the hom@@ etown as Seren@@ ade @-@ Organiz@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
the association wants to examine permission of Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ s
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim re@@ vered &quot; &quot; does not fores@@ ee a legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned towards the Council of land . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim re@@ vered &quot; has promp@@ ted the Council of Andreas Co@@ ens ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is un@@ law@@ ful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen only on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power concentration zone .
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , at the same time the concentr@@ ating zone , however , causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the resi@@ dual city area . &quot;
&quot; these zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette in a few days before , but the District government was not approved , due to a form of error . &quot;
&quot; by the lack of plan@@ ation legal requirement , the appro@@ vals remains un@@ law@@ ful and therefore , Christoph Er@@ kens said , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the town@@ ship was once again decided before the summer break the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit of the District government still stands out .
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding writing are received since last week in the district Vier@@ sen , &quot; stated a narr@@ ator . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the issue again .
they are not likely to result in that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view of the current proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle of Thursday did not want to express themselves on the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , an affiliate of the NEW , is planning on an area on the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high win@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; already last year the company had been involved in which the city of quad@@ ri@@ val is involved , pun@@ is@@ contracts with the owners of approximately 65 hectares of large terrain . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of approximately 11 400 households will be covered - this is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Three City Council gave green light to purchase three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cr@@ ashes together : woman dies at horrible accident
one horrible traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and B@@ uss ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal .
two more people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
the country road remained locked over hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman came from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car as part of the companion with her 53 @-@ year mother as a companion to the L 333 in direction . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ ters@@ za@@ we@@ ther and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September .
&quot; the commercial organisation and city management want to take advantage of the weekend on 8th and 9th September to enti@@ ce the inhabitants of the city @-@ stroll into the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the profession , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ ould &quot; &quot; weekend the customers are sensitive to which offers travel their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center to &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ tern@@ ach@@ ts Sh@@ ould &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thereby , the promotion is not only on inhabitants of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation for commerci@@ als on the radio , an Internet video and printed bag , which point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association collaborate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; thus , the business association and the city into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers like the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest including selling so@@ ff@@ ering Sunday , talks with all commercial ties and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and ren@@ unci@@ ation on par@@ amount per day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be re@@ developed or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
&quot; but also many local people would have lost the inner city , shopping from the sight . &quot;
&quot; in the end , everybody would have to share the city center - up to land@@ lords , the factories around the city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it came to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , who made themselves partly filled , had been king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Strei@@ ch , leader of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that in the nation@@ wide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , five Thur@@ ingi@@ an cities participate . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , these are Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ lighter . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ ves &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and promote its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; Stri@@ pes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also make it clear that every citizen can influence its head @-@ shaped environment .
two dead and several verses to explosion at US @-@ school
&quot; during construction , it came to a gas blast in the school building . &quot;
new further people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; at a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine others have been wounded , some of them were heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a last in critic@@ ised state . &quot;
a man died as part of a school building at the explosion .
a first ming@@ led was also dead @-@ born later .
in the dead it was the meeting of the school .
&quot; as un@@ fortunate , the authorities suspected work on a gas guide . &quot;
at the holiday season only few people stopped in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp replaced by telephone call by telephone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border .
tran@@ scription of telephone call for US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp called on a phone with the Mexican presidency En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. president accused him , because he had ou@@ den@@ oun@@ ced the wall by openly the wall . he said to him , &quot; &quot; This is what you cannot say to the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall to the southern border of the United States , and schw@@ anst@@ or , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first analog@@ y with the Australian prime minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and un@@ covered a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , to take over &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was adopted by the government Obama to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; , &quot; once he proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch as a call for justice back
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk from the Ford @-@ bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined forces to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle aged man in a needle t@@ adel@@ ke - took a long turn to its cig@@ ar and looked carefully using the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; bel@@ lied the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; writing the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was distor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only a post @-@ position . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all in the audience were very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Bürger@@ judicial to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge returned to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 were killed . &quot;
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it really is in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested , although we see them in our communities although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in organising the post@@ position . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year former congress of Congress Georgia and a life of a citizen .
&quot; for him the post@@ position serves as a dramatic call to action , and represents an annual reminder of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice never was corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal tracking , we want the ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive righteousness , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot come into healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a judgement of judgement on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ x on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI acts which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Graf@@ it@@ ances in the Lyn@@ ch process . &quot;
but nobody was ever charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizen in Georgia for the first time , in the summer , to give their voice in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ächter Roger Mal@@ com a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s woman Dor@@ othy and that the baby who carried her not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent house owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they removed himself from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b embr@@ aced the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , closes it out of a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a complete co @-@ operation between state and local criminal prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ers , evidence , and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even pre@@ gn@@ ant .
&quot; it was an electoral mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you agree , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of the Cass@@ andra founded the annual im@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is vivid , grasp , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many believe he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to speak about the Lyn@@ x , because we then are confronted with its ugly , in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did through .
&quot; the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors had almost 30 actors - a dozen past@@ ries and the rest of Black - in a room and lou@@ der , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ys Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester , and p@@ ushes it , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n -- he , w@@ asting my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ eth the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at lau@@ ght .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ r . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and that is precisely the energy in space , a sense of camera is replacing the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this properly , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and leads to Bil@@ lie Holidays h@@ iting lob@@ ite &quot; &quot; Str@@ ange Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about one hundred meters away there is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , stim@@ ulated to see the performance , many come down just down the road . &quot;
they all experienced almost eight hours of Georgia when Bro@@ oks sie on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until that point the Mor@@ de have stayed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de have been converted , the air feels sil@@ ver@@ ted table . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to insp@@ ected the cor@@ ch@@ name . &quot;
children ho@@ cken at their minds to register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ ess a little boy , as if he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes it ow@@ es Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l weg and w@@ ish their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh that played the male member in the starter .
Nick Ras@@ cona envel@@ ope two of his fellow @-@ players and then we@@ eping up in her arms ; the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; fle@@ eing one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience will set up with the actors for dinner together .
&quot; at a table , a white couple from Atlanta has stim@@ ulated by a black pair , which they have just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski Com@@ peti@@ tions to find words which left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and they do what they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me leaves me believing that the Lyn@@ x still goes on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks is holding in his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the post@@ position is in a certain way inspir@@ ational , as she describes the hor@@ rors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &apos; , the w@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth &quot;

&quot; stor@@ my is celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ rig@@ ent Jan@@ owski , who conc@@ eal his hands and the hands on Merkel smo@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is a great appl@@ ause for the first time that shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat back in casual leisure . &quot;
the gig was anticipated by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 he had to make sure to give a p@@ ale concert , in 2013 , there were five years later big rejo@@ icing in which the sh@@ one &quot; &quot; bu@@ ck &quot; &quot; were under@@ gone . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; one noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the launch of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience had not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its point of view . &quot;
I am a positive reset .

and then I asked me what do you do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the net@@ point maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social @-@ term for my studies in the social @-@ term .
&quot; I will study dual , most likely do in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t H@@ erne a social work training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not unusual during the volunteer service to have several different locations ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it is probably always on where you can be F@@ S@@ J .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work .
for me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I was able to see and see my own strengths and see how it really exp@@ ires .
different from civil engineering study ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to count st@@ atics . &quot;
one always has other people vor@@ m head which each have a completely different story behind .
&quot; whether a refugee , if a teen@@ ager has been caught out of the family - you must always deal with it . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have any touch ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives you a lot .
much love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so life is just . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ated the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will build other 3,000 jobs and cut their inter@@ divi@@ dend by 72 percent as another restructuring program will be launched to face the company with which the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the job@@ house , the General Director John Fall@@ on , predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring where 4,000 jobs were lost . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to head a business again , which was hit by the fast step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had expressed its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House in the Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year has been unchanged , after it achieved a growth of 1 per cent to 2,@@ 05 billion pounds during the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier at Self @-@ fired attack
&quot; a su@@ ic@@ ide bom@@ b has attacked a military con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul , soldiers of Nato and other in@@ ju@@ red , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter may have been in@@ ju@@ red as an explanation of Nato .
&quot; un@@ confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the district Q@@ ab was also three civilians . &quot;
the bom@@ bing mission is the last non @-@ violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday there was a self @-@ ord@@ ained two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion in Nato , the explo@@ sion on Thursday evening may be done as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army of a &quot; &quot; of people &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ ded &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement declares that all of these last in a stable state are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the Air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ab is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there was at least 1.6@@ 62 civilian deaths , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a su@@ ic@@ ide @-@ auto@@ om@@ be at least 30 people in a chi@@ ev@@ ous district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they would have done this attack .
&quot; on May 31st , there was an enormous bom@@ bing in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the U.S. led troops in 2001 the Taliban from power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering the number of U.S. troops , the military and police support in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ ic@@ ide bom@@ b@@ ates in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule after pl@@ edges
&quot; the US American environmental protection authorities have a decision to delay regulation of the Government of Obama , and lifted up what the states are obliged to susp@@ end the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency because of the p@@ st@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Policy 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remembering that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA and Scott P@@ ru@@ des in an explanation . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to be measured in those in some of the country &apos;s claims to determine where inc@@ isions are needed to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , lasted on Tuesday law@@ suit , and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to impose a wide range of environmental issues that former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and can reinforce the breath@@ able symptoms , &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
coun@@ cill@@ or wants community @-@ room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter @-@ vote , the Municip@@ al of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a communal space in the future seniors . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing property was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until now , until the so far the church @-@ community has belonged to the common property , but there is now no planning in@@ compatible for the project from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project . &quot;
there is a discussion concerning a shared space .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipalities , such a common room is not considered a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ fair , but open into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word was made from &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck café &quot; &quot; round . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided in the past autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; the establishment of a shared area would be , so reported T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent promoting . &quot;
&quot; the decision proposal looks to sign@@ alling the investor that one wants to throw him in this respect not a bu@@ zz@@ ling between the legs , finding out that both Satt@@ el@@ ds - what reduces the ambient light and the construction of economic power - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so does not only mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
when it helps : in@@ consistent he happens the body .
not as easy as it is in the common room .
&quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings with which one cannot move quite right now , for it is now a common room in the window , says it : &quot; I do not make me difficult . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a communist contribution .
it sees behind it a covered sub@@ invention in any case of any case or even foreign investors .
&quot; if this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no subsidies , but may be a real , in the two @-@ fel@@ ine market value , the counter is inter@@ viewed . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , referring to the set of decision , takes place three supporters . &quot;
&quot; for instance , it remains in two counter@@ parts when it comes to the original program , the Stefan H@@ alles , saying , &quot; If we put the decision so , we make a giant step down in our infrastructure . &quot;

that was last not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an au@@ ction in the first official game of the season .

in Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z the nation@@ wide first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; was born .
this is planning the association Stern@@ ties San@@ kt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path is there in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; an &quot; star trail &quot; come to the information of many har@@ bours , called it . &quot;
&quot; he connecting nature , science , exercise and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set up along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 the association is planning to reach &quot; &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the tablets should be suppl@@ em@@ ented by internet .
&quot; therefore , in the location of the production of a good mobile network reception . &quot;
also Acces@@ sibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the Star@@ en@@ pf@@ ad train to be expanded by train .
&quot; on the star@@ trail , the viewer will learn a lot of knowledge , for example , on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned how stars could have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than one else , although he is much further away . &quot;
&quot; you will also be convey@@ ed in which constell@@ ation is a chosen star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been running since 2014 in the mountain Town Hall of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye clearly visible .
&quot; since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen , there have been something similar to the planned observ@@ atory - the plan@@ eten@@ weg . &quot;
&quot; beginning before Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary weg with its poles up to Hain@@ berg and for observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( Municip@@ ality of Glei@@ chen ) with the Planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
the ste@@ els with the single planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ engra@@ ved Pl@@ uto at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth is shr@@ ink as a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meter diameter , while the exact 75 meters remo@@ ves the sun at least 70 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is a good four kilometers .
&quot; while the light of sun rises to Pl@@ uto , for about eight hours , ped@@ est@@ rians need a good hour up to the stand with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
ped@@ est@@ rians are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed but would last a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time in discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia should stand in a coll@@ isions in the near future under 147 pounds and met for the first time on Thursday .
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ locked World Box@@ ing Council , the corrid@@ or , to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Box@@ ing organization Super @-@ fe@@ ather champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through an agre@@ eable vote on the former four @-@ divisions Adri@@ en Bron@@ zer on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .

I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko defended his Bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. to ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for photos presented , noted Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show@@ down between the struggle could be the &quot; perfect size order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I am up for bronze &#91; to 140 Po@@ unds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run@@ down to light weight .

we demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko votes to .
&quot; box@@ ing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asking if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 pounds @-@ de@@ stu@@ d in this year will fight to arrange a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ weight competition in the forum on September 23 . &quot;

four - Last after tire @-@ bur@@ sts
an accident on the A7 on Thursday in the afternoon four people were seriously in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; after initial information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost against 16.@@ 30 , shortly before the head of the market , probably after a tire bur@@ sting the control of his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the cars s@@ cour@@ ded to the right to the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he proposed and then lie on the roof of the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were partly damaged in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last through the b@@ ail@@ out service , the A7 in the direction of North for about one hour was locked , then the traffic could be passing on the left lane to the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; tri@@ erk@@ ette work better &quot;
Andre Hoff@@ mann hopes after the 2 : 2 to the Seas@@ on@@ ent against Br@@ uns@@ wick that brings the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points .
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andre Hoff@@ mann was happy with the result , they would not have been the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must even better fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Ore Mountains , the tri@@ erk@@ ette will also be further optim@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; and one door after a free turn , the For@@ tun@@ es want to get out of the For@@ tun@@ es . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no longer exists alongside Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team comes better with the experience in preparation with the Triple @-@ chain , than with the quad@@ r@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoff@@ mann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; because we have just finished in the three @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can communicate well , &quot; &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is a pre@@ condition for us , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not afford so many bugs . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoff@@ mann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot speak after a mis@@ chosen start , I do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are able to concentrate on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the trophy , we will certainly speak of a neat season . &quot;
he wanted to know his coach nothing .
&quot; the start into the season started by six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ y , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim pre@@ matur@@ ely had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season practically with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann believes that players from Au@@ e might be even a bit of fresh , since they could have no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascen@@ sion favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defen@@ ders of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests from the Rhein@@ land as a lighter Favor@@ it on Sunday in the encounter ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we take them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ nonsense , &quot; says Funk@@ body , whose balance sheet is quite positive at just one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to strike from the outset , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chef@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement is arrogan@@ t , arrogan@@ t and Hebrew . &quot;
and so radio does not want to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ application tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for for@@ en@@ ic medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing tests last year .
&quot; they should make the estimate of the ages more accurately during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ation gran@@ et ) was critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations has been sent to 6,@@ 8@@ 80 and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of total 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency command@@ ed that the person may &apos; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person may be under 18 years old .
the tests are only conducted in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high percentage of cases where the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has suffered over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the om@@ itted person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det had released the 5@@ 81 results , she asked that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that in this year they were 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in case of X @-@ rays of wheat @-@ teeth and MR@@ T recordings are made by Kni@@ fe , which then be analysed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were used sooner or later than pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I have reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is quite uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it safe , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in this case these are about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes has been he@@ ap of emphasis on the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;

&quot; the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge of concrete , which is ra@@ yed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;

this is a Rand@@ om@@ ination which is also used as a operating path .
the southern part of the bridge should be used on Friday a progressive meter wide bridge .
it should then go on the pedestrian path .
&quot; this particular interest is that this is about finished , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented brack@@ ets .
particular finger@@ tips has the embarrass@@ ed of lines due to the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass fiber , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the works by hand@@ piece on the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and canc@@ ers had to be de@@ duc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building , and the collective in direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a Amp@@ el . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge on the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher Local entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; is locked . &quot;
the costs for the three brid@@ les are a total of 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .

&quot; it is not so frequent that parties will go to a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ for@@ D ) , comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;

&quot; but those who are in front of the event before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ s , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colour@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking area below the R@@ ond@@ heim - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ for@@ ge event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a bun@@ gee picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A World and one of the relevant organizers , really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ ak , &quot; &quot; says the woman who has brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police led many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ ak volcan@@ os reported that he tries to endeav@@ or to receive such an event and the surcharge .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes is not available enough parking . &quot;
&quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; looking to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says , &quot; This is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : against 20 o &apos;clock in the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhine @-@ Palat@@ inate Mand@@ D chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall , about 200 listen@@ er , who are waiting for the top @-@ candidate for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix had to hold her speeches . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; slightly more than an hour takes the Af@@ for@@ dable event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 hours puri@@ fication . &quot;
the police can be back - no special happ@@ en@@ ings .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ hear with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ est Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i there are in the row of Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; Schwarz@@ meer in Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ hood &quot; &quot; meets classic German training with roots in bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions , and have sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European high seas . &quot;
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is a soldier of the SW@@ R Symphony .
&quot; both united the desire , not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gar@@ ment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , mix classic , jazz and the free play to a fascinating total of art . &quot;
this core piece of the program was first mentioned this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the most prestigious composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with its special acoustic is deliberately made into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ its
&quot; some people love che@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart &quot; &quot; openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual bis@@ ex@@ its . &quot;
&quot; when I went in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next to next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ ur@@ stars was the one to her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; despite all this ass@@ uring the br@@ isk performer to the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in any serious love that I remembered . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I could have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten got that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I have never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them she said to &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but in the school time , when she preferred like a boy , &quot; not all the girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has in@@ ju@@ red me .
&quot; when I was eleven I told me the kids , I would look like a book . &quot;
I really felt very attacked and embarrass@@ ed and ash@@ amed .
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public , they don &apos;t like to love their love life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and up@@ set me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps I call me some un@@ brid@@ geable , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today , I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in ju@@ ble .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach I would say , that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp spoke previously a great announcement at West Virginia R@@ ally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice grant not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was chosen in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes ensures that he possesses a coal in five countries , and have inherited a carbon business by his father . &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night announced a statement in which it said , &quot; &quot; Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a democratic party which would be more likely to work than to work for our country . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , some sort of message , &quot; said R@@ NC @-@ President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ bt &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for D@@ oping @-@ sc@@ andal
&quot; the worldwide boss of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed back in sports . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Convention on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championship that the exile of his country from the sport was correct and that he decided to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , which were cut away from competitions , and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress held responsible for maintaining the For@@ bidden , which was published in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) notices on state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the Repor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times , and do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; said , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said , &quot; &quot; he was also delighted that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin at the athle@@ tics World Championship , which started Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still need some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ gent@@ qu@@ ests are still inadequate and betra@@ yed trainer are still free , he said Repor@@ ters in London after a talk at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
O@@ bit@@ or@@ act for in Mali rep@@ lied soldiers
at a funeral party in the northe@@ ast@@ ern Fr@@ itz@@ lar have thought about 1000 people of the two at a helicop@@ ter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; to the yet un@@ resolved Ab@@ storm , Secretary General of the Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) . &quot;
&quot; they recorded the two comm@@ enting pilots , but as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we persec@@ ute us before this highest victim , which they have undertaken in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their S@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and consul@@ ted on Thursday by the defen@@ ders of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom San@@ kt Peter .
at lunch@@ time only the relatives were taken in the church fare@@ well .
&quot; after that , the funeral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Secretary of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; Trau@@ erg@@ ä@@ ste laid ros@@ es , the relatives were standing by arm in my arms . &quot;
in front of the church c@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; Secretary of Defense of the Ley@@ en referred to as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann have been the air @-@ operation of the martial @-@ style tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with built and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the regim@@ ent , explained : &quot; &quot; if these occupation could not turn the crash , it would not have lost none . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali he was not shown by the Ley@@ en : the use may be dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high significance for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the har@@ dened were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik does not want to be a grave in addition to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried beside his wife after his death . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish Royal Palace is located at the Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard provided already a coff@@ k@@ oph@@ ag for the two .
the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband &apos;s decision and it continues to be in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to be set in his French hom@@ el@@ ands .
prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he went to retirement and also places the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ c@@ als &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark has not received the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - not after death , explained L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the Chief of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the last retirement of the 83 @-@ year will ultimately be , be unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be set in his French hom@@ el@@ ands , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ acy , had seen Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked at the Thames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik had a serious stand at the D@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sul@@ king , I preferred wine instead of beer , Seiden@@ str@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of soccer , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and those in this country had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ oc@@ ative intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope to hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ash@@ amed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; former President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling majority for a swift re @-@ election of the country , he wants to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because speaking on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising resign@@ ation of a Green Party in Lower Saxony the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) had thrown into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ et made their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency ( des@@ erts ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ act@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his fac@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; in this way CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ American country , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was reverse .
the new land day is re @-@ elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state authority can now decide whether they would continue to gover@@ n in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the country decides as quickly as its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday for further action on Tuesday .
&quot; the state of the country also sees the possibility that the governor of the Prime Minister makes the confidence , and cho@@ oses a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be checked in legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss all questions in silence , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the political leader himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was designated as a tr@@ acker from black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apost@@ as@@ y members on the return of their country @-@ country .
&quot; we of course goes out that they receive their country @-@ day basis , which they receive over the green state lists , shared with immediate effect , the state @-@ of the met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ et . &quot;
they deliberately decided to have no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the fac@@ tion .
&quot; also in front of the background , there was no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ an@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condemned the crossing of the Gre@@ ens Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behavior of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al of the voters and voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) who quickly choose the country in the country .
the resign@@ ation of the west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the policy of policy &quot; in their last erup@@ tion , and in their fr@@ ust their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary of Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony turns this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ ess and tries to beat out of political capital . &quot;
Nieder@@ tu@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ act@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MEPs to accommodate El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ west before , with personal career , the outcome of the country @-@ election in 2013 to fal@@ si@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the SPD most powerful force , the SPD and Green had a large majority of one voice in the country . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from pl@@ ast@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed over ver@@ ted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumer protect themselves .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) speech and response .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against po@@ ison eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage consumer rights and consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the st@@ emp@@ y print .
&quot; on the consumer &apos;s consumer portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ing.com , the Bundes@@ länder contains the latest information on the eggs of the eggs of the eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is virtually eliminated . &quot;
now Al@@ di the best possible crisis re@@ traction - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of enligh@@ tening from the German agricultural Minister is not really perceived ?
food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house is immediately off immediately and since announ@@ cing Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; trade has the same as the manufacturers to worry about , that the goods sold goods are busi@@ ly and health@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; if eggs are exceeded with eggs of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ traffic . &quot;
un@@ contaminated eggs are however sold and consumed .
this time not the operations to blame .
sitting factories and consumers in the same boat ?
after the same time the production of production meets no immediate fault .
&quot; rather , they must count on account of mut@@ scale illegal practices of services such as economic damages . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little contro@@ l@@ le@@ ure in the harvest . &quot;
is it only missing on the staff or even at the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls that have un@@ covered the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely because of this , a consistent awareness of such events and the delivery to the prosec@@ ution in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made clear many times , that I expect a seam@@ less clarification from the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular Al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; consumer goods and consumers have the right to get safe , safe and safe foods . &quot;
&quot; if a non @-@ approved In@@ sec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food sector , consumer consumers and consumers are rightly emp@@ tied . &quot;
&quot; due to the prescribed means , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are coming into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pr@@ oni@@ l in the attitude of life @-@ food supplies is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it must be consistent at all levels and work with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is breeding and pun@@ ished .
how the financial regulate of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent tremendous expenditure on European foot@@ paths , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEF@@ A , because the leading organization that has been monitored by the European game has the power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which was launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is received a sal@@ ary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure the money blo@@ cker to make N@@ ey@@ mar , and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the teams through the energy rich gl@@ ean family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; one may apply to the acquisition of players a lot of money , but have to deal with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to allow the Bre@@ ak Even point in their field of football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that in their pursuit of success achieved enormous debt by themselves , effectively che@@ ating and risky to ruin , if banks or owners have returned their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P declined from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to build the crew and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P pre@@ disposition period , that runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini had fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A success@@ ors Alek@@ s@@ ander p@@ efer@@ in continue to cry out of excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; for sure FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount of invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the deposits can be submitted for the next five years in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a € 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is searching for clubs , which could try to re@@ plen@@ ish their financial supervision by connecting their revenues by companies , which are connected with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ical company could have the PS@@ G sponsors , if the value of sponsorship would exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered to be legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of the P@@ SA was paraly@@ sed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar has made payments to the Organis@@ ing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar World &apos;s Ambassador will be able to simply find out such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more thou@@ ghtful every attempt to deal with the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , reserved on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of € 54@@ 2,@@ 4 million in revenue of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last year will still be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ kot@@ eller . &quot;
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players go , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s en@@ ade , having asser@@ ted that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financing dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s latter to PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a State , which is funded by the association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; said Mr Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will respect very difficult to respect finance Fair@@ play , because one has different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new product supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aboard @-@ chocolate has produced for the Swiss Life .
&quot; now , the committees are facing a possible end : the airline writes the order again . &quot;

No@@ stalgia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is simultaneously no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural object , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be almost . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ or ( it contained a original story for a speaking thin vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; stepping out at the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages , vacc@@ inated children , who grow to grow - they nevertheless managed to gain the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; with his adult , who now play adults , is less emoti@@ onally rooted and his par@@ ody goes on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , who read the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some in@@ line Sk@@ ates and a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now roman@@ tics , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy P@@ lot who is involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the Ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; it makes much fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ at@@ ee from &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could trigger this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years &quot; &quot; the final scene will show the gang &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now remin@@ is@@ cent of another kind of no@@ stalgia : to the re@@ vit@@ alization of the Cold War by &quot; &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ ing @-@ ion . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka Thomas as director gives Thomas to be a found TV series : a Romanian Drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , A@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main resist@@ ing - a hard @-@ working Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ al Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs of Chann@@ ing Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English are syn@@ ced .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police spends the time to watch chess on television as Americans may do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Find the voice out &apos; . &quot;
but Com@@ rade Det@@ ective is thus committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who bears a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it is often just like a single .
&quot; with six long episodes it moves to that , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who has been re@@ di@@ fied on a lower length , could deliver its Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ s@@ ati@@ re better , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef could still visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is occupied by two thick men who wear a bunch of Hamburg . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inations Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for eating a terrain .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger story and with thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs @-@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were inv@@ aded , such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office is w@@ edge on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 years , 15 alleg@@ ations were arrested and signed in the age between 25 years and 77 . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the officials presented greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundreds of thousands Euros . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two wounded Italians there were German arrest warran@@ t .
this is why the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
at the action Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the m@@ af@@ ia will be organised crime criminal , poor violence , killing murder as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since the summer of 2016 , the Prosec@@ ution Con@@ stance against the organised crime trade in the Southern Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ ships in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a re@@ an exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil , had virtually daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the major part in the Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
in the sights of the investigations especially Italian nation@@ als covered with a close connection to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
&quot; even a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , early in the morning several shots were taken into a guest house , is likely to go to the bank account . &quot;
thus lam@@ ents lam@@ b in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; : a report according to the foreig@@ ner Register in Germany has significant shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ zing mis@@ decisions at the asylum process .
&quot; the be@@ acon for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen &apos;s , has drawn attention to large gaps in the non @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; shortcomings in the registered data could result in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; to some serious obj@@ ections , &quot; warned in an analysis that is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , the data is estimated ten million people with foreign nation@@ als , including about 5.5 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 external agencies in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts so far not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become citizens citizens and are actually no longer able to dive in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data entries can significantly slo@@ w@@ down , it means the report continues . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed people , all the EU citizens are registered , who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such false assign@@ ments led &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with emig@@ rate , &quot; it is therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return to Italy to return to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived . &quot;
&quot; that comes out of an internal paper of the Federal Convention for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ retro@@ spect Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it means that the BAM@@ F lead to these methods &quot; regarding families with children - except inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , so the paper referred to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin treaty , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to get it first . &quot;
&quot; if a migration is far @-@ reaching into another EU country , this state can rec@@ ede it back into the unic@@ ycle . &quot;
&quot; the reason for reason@@ ing is now : &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with min@@ der children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy approved for inclusion and accommodation of family warranty .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) hold this promise for sufficient .
other EU states would also return refugees in the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the interior political spokes@@ man in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children , because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights , and a haz@@ ard of the child &apos;s living . &quot;
a second result achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people were already available for other people .
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , which were excellent on Friday . &quot;

&quot; traditionally , the community used to don@@ ate the community in the meeting of the community the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;

&quot; at the same time Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported of the actions , which are performed in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 divisions , the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K champi@@ ons . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep the interest rates of 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected later to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; and the interest rates on family in@@ coming in the midst of an increased pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25 % , whereby less members gain a rise in this month since the weak economic growth has been weak@@ ened for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report reduced the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1,6 % , and warned that pressure on the budget@@ ary would likely continue to rise up almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ aled that in the coming years Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities would be necessary to breed the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and she said that the credit costs may possibly longer than expected to get on the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut sub@@ jun@@ c@@ ets which was issued prior to a year after Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will demand time for funding action to provide over the coming February budget financial resources for banks , although said that they will be expected 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the Real@@ istic households will continue to be charged the consumption . &quot;
&quot; on the interest rates repeated it repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; is needed for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; dimension than the markets are expected . &quot;
the markets predicted the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank stressed however , that &quot; &quot; increases &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are forecast compared to those in May , 1.9 % and 1.7 % . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pounds fell after these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1 US dollars and fell by 0.3 % to the globe .
&quot; the decision to any change comes after the recent dis@@ continued growth numbers , and GDP rise in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.7 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected in the third quarter of 0.7 % , although it is easy to rec@@ u@@ perate after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent inc@@ ision report provided little enthusiasm for households , affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ time cav@@ ity since the tigh@@ tening first becomes worse before they get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income of income in the next few years , but it added that wages are projected at the end of their three @-@ year growth &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound rather than compens@@ ated for a portion of lower consumption . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the s@@ ham of the P@@ act . &quot;
the bank appreci@@ ates that it will likely take four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the final Jud@@ gment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call has risen to the rate of interest , as inflation increased pressure on hard households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanded an increase in 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation is dropped last month by 2.9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was anticipated and will resume it in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the exce@@ eding in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; entirely &quot; to the weak pounds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; given the recent return of s@@ wap arrangements , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the cred@@ itors would like to search for shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is especially good for those who run the existing De@@ als and conclude the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low edges are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to write controversial HIV @-@ threats 10,000 people &quot;
patients will be obtained from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse has been added pre @-@ ex@@ posi@@ tional prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the infection risks at high risk assessment by around 86 percent , now from health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court affirm@@ ed a judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the second edition announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss , Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are going to be the first that will allow the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October 2018 in all of England in April 2018 . &quot;
predic@@ tive prevention ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations to be taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV @-@ broadcast at infectious agents .
to take pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question belong to gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successful . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified appropriate participants that agree to study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti @-@ viral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a household doctor , can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic . &quot;
&quot; the programme is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS , signed a contract for delivery of the drugs during this week after an international competitive procurement . &quot;
&quot; the study is intended to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p , collected by clinical trials , as it is used on a large scale and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV and over@@ take . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted on need@@ y and endangered people , the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people , people with high HIV risk gaining access to this N@@ HS funded attempt to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and not with a partner with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now must lie that the study is quickly carried out across the country and no one who has a risk to HIV . &quot;
&quot; now as the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine has been ho@@ oked , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadows of the Ministry of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome to months of delays and frau@@ dul@@ ent implementation by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ atively this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this life changing infection .
this attempt gives us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected , and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
life living : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized 2014 by a big house in Kni@@ ghts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ ghts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I was looking for something , which was comparable to my price . &quot;
this flat was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
I have fallen in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square kilometres was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a One @-@ room property with a w@@ alled layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne Stau@@ raum and a mezzanine to make optimal ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , they commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill that was 12 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over@@ another , so the architectural challenge was there to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative in order to resolve the presentation .
&quot; the steel is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the spaces so that they were over@@ thrown , without we had to wi@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot;
this order enabled Er@@ fan to place two spaces full of height - with a lot of extra drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic cou@@ pling window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can get over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumin@@ ations the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of spi@@ kes plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
both ends is a short corrid@@ or mir@@ r@@ ored to let him take longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units room for all stocks and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room may shut the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
assem@@ ble kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a gar@@ dener .
&quot; a bit of engineering went there , &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is so important , so if you slide the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cl@@ ever@@ ly use of space and storage room Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to increase the ground floor and use high quality materials , which provide space with its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not dec@@ eive you in the electric plugs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased area of slightly lower in something completely admir@@ able .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate imperi@@ alists
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation with one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &quot; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis is living in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 properties have accumulated in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family since 1973 joined a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the family of West@@ co je@@ ans , and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . bulk and shopping centres in the subur@@ ban neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and dominating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s company and Paul about one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction means that Col@@ in property is owned by 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a direct point for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote 2015 in a first monkey av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed cab@@ inets , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in as Paul claimed it .
&quot; Col@@ in argu@@ ed , this is not true , but raises Paul before , some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent to manage . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey av@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to set the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage is writing that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;

&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ he years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property and opened in Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their ownership to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brethren to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark were paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , says Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to mo@@ ck me and pull our family name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in , he wrote in a writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our Father had not wondered that Paul and I would end in our ongoing battle , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Stab@@ sch@@ ef is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ eman reports that the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including the news media media - in the hope to hold the boss at a equal course . &quot;
here is a piece of Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ sch@@ ef of the White House , met at his first working day with leading employees , he set up a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s white house which he wants to fix : bad information which got into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to de@@ pi@@ ate Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media monitoring . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Candi@@ date was anno@@ yed because of a non @-@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was able to convince a fair reporting of places that had been persu@@ aded , &quot; said the former electoral advisor Sam Nun@@ berg in February compared to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; The Key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media use would include a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter are ever &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these campaign be@@ es know something we could not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twe@@ ets without their interventions had even more loc@@ alities .
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ et that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his employee knew him several times , who keep away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently preventing it , that Tru@@ mp check out . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a white house consists of competing parties , again and again try to advance their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that may possibly improve their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors , to the President of strategic reasons of des@@ perate information . &quot;
this was an example which was described by the Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp as a volcano can react to negative press cuts , above all those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can find out of it where these come . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened in late February when someone gave the president mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty Stab@@ sch@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; &quot; the source behind a p@@ ile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was ex@@ iled from Twitter because Shi@@ kan@@ en , or that he has no concrete evidence or that he vo@@ iced in the past false demonstrations and re@@ vo@@ ke them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former St@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a effective manager as pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ si@@ ves self , and his consultants are still heading for influence . &quot;
these undes@@ irable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ ett@@ led crimin@@ als get the post of Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the mi@@ tigation of the population will worship and expected . &quot;
the police across Europe sends this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminal app@@ rais@@ al on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the requested gra@@ de@@ bre@@ cher natur@@ als are not known , there will be evidence of the population and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many wings were hiding at vacation places , called it from Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for smo@@ ked crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the on @-@ line application could previously be arrested , at least eleven of them due to hints on the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; milli@@ on@@ aires series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some deci@@ du@@ ous travelers on war pl@@ ague , who negotiated one of the community @-@ drawn dit@@ ch to reg@@ ain a field in front of their men &apos;s houses . &quot;
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans in a field outside a af@@ flu@@ ent road of Soli@@ h@@ ull par@@ ked that is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aires series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , having been rejected only in May , without being de@@ ported by one from the Council to prevent their inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; the tak@@ e@@ full group found a gap in the defense units , and thr@@ ust their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot;
&quot; hidden inhabitants have p@@ ushes the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said that it is &quot; useless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; &quot; They are pulled up there on the assembly , after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they cast stone to the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by means of implementation in fact , as when dealing with the problem was useless . &quot;
the travellers were in May there were moved forward and are now back again .
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to cope with it , by holding long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy , continue to pay my community , if the Council may not even stop . &quot;
&quot; a living that didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; said , &quot; It is ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ agu@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; this time , the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; speaker of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many people can report a anti @-@ social or criminal conduct by the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court needs to be examined , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
&quot; the house is being renovated in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt , and should be opened on 1 March next year . &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , due to the time setting of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in the time of April 2014 , it was charged approximately 30 000 nights per year and is also lost in revenue by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in the view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees , which came into the district , the hotel building offered the Land@@ rat@@ ory as a collective accommodation , provided with the contro@@ versy discussions . &quot;
&quot; the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a ban &apos;s plan , in order to secure the area as a hotel location . &quot;
the decision was at that time in the council not un@@ controversial .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ citizenship , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prosp@@ ective interested in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with head leader Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object houses four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof already existed for a long period of construction container before the entrance , and when one enters the house , clearly what extensive renovation works will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were turned out , blank@@ ets to the part was built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is a lot to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is arranged , there will be new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything then later &quot; &quot; beautiful br@@ g@@ ern@@ ah &quot; &quot; will express as Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece out , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual holiday makers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , he has already led , so many . &quot;
the noti@@ ons of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to define exactly . &quot;
just under a million euros he expects .
&quot; the doors are also brought forward to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace comes from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : us @-@ Special er sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair concerning U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp , we have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report . &quot;
&quot; the Panel recorded the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to confidential persons . &quot;
&quot; the paper value the step as a sign , that Mu@@ eller expanded its investigation and intensified . &quot;
&quot; the Channel CN@@ N reported , I already give the first announ@@ cements of the Gre@@ cian in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; U.S. intelligence services accused the Krem@@ lin since long , specifically to get into the presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there was draf@@ ting between Tru@@ mp@@ s campaigns and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigation , several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ cans . &quot;
&quot; according to that , Mu@@ eller took a private and more tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special er Tru@@ mp was in the center for a few weeks , and looking for the accus@@ ation whether the president in the wake of the affair could possibly hin@@ dered the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of Grand Jur@@ ys , it is to examine and decide to examine and decide whether indic@@ t@@ ment is to be raised . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called counts . &quot;
&quot; mostly they are switched , if it is bigger and contro@@ versy cases . &quot;
the process always takes doors behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched from the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office to pre @-@ download people under the ov@@ ation .
&quot; according to the radio CN@@ N , the inv@@ itations were already exhibited , which turn to the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
persons who were involved in the meeting were asked to have a statement called in the report .
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. were also Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and swi@@ f@@ ers@@ ohn Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ al@@ election director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday night in U.S. television , that the replacement show that Mu@@ eller can &apos;t get in@@ timi@@ d in his work and that he should be necessary if necessary , to act quickly . &quot;
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched at the end to decide on the completion of an indic@@ t@@ ment .
&quot; nevertheless , the formation of the Gre@@ cian is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president on Thursday night , a speech given in West Virginia , to present the Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the theme give the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he caught nothing about the suspension of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , this work also usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House feared all actions that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI chef James Com@@ ey wrote three times that not determined with the President .
&quot; we have no reason to believe that something has changed , it meant in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this ran@@ ged , alleg@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become loud , he did not want to hin@@ der justice . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp have asked him for setting the investigation against the former national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president stands under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered the White House material against the special medium and its staff . &quot;
the delet@@ eri@@ ous spec@@ ulations about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller released .
&quot; unlike an independent special medium of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair concerning the later former president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has conducted a position in which he theoretically could be fired in theory of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step but prev@@ ent@@ able .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented on Thursday law@@ suit , after which the special investig@@ ator could no longer be released as easy . &quot;
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in the Antarc@@ tic
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has solved itself from the almost seven @-@ seven size of Berlin from the resort . &quot;
&quot; this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ , and marine research on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the big pist@@ on tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers @-@ sized Kol@@ oss is now coming to the north and probably will need two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ice giant , the researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
&quot; however , the climate change played a role in the break@@ up of the ic@@ eberg , is unclear after research information . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual cor@@ es in the region for around 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be connected to the heating up . &quot;
the now descen@@ ded pist@@ on has hitherto been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ s .
Schel@@ get@@ s and is fed by the sea and is fed by the big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this experience was the balance of wax and ab@@ rupt before a few years ago .
a complete Schel@@ et@@ s may be crus@@ hed there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is some things that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ s are in danger , as the pre@@ dominant edge has never been as far back as it currently has . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the ice @-@ plate are under tension and can be crus@@ hed if at a key place a piece of play . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ g@@ s and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level , since they swim in the water and p@@ ushes ice so much water as it yields after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of consciousness leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level , but only in the light , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ s is after AW@@ I data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the fourth largest in the Antarc@@ tic .
&quot; at the transfer from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters . &quot;
there it will break down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ic@@ schild is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists whether the lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ s now grow again or go back long @-@ term , and possibly assem@@ ble his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models are saying that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers did not return the departure of this gigantic ic@@ eberg that will fall back on climate change , so much of the ice r@@ ages of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula are broken in recent decades . &quot;
this long strip of the Antarc@@ tica covers South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has declined since the 1950@@ s to 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
to the decline in temperature was increased .
&quot; in the past 50 years the Antarc@@ tic peninsula have grown around three degrees in the past 50 years and with it to the areas , in which the temperature at the fastest growing . &quot;
CD@@ U want Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy outside places , calls for CD@@ U to step out of the worker @-@ association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , the Krei@@ stag took 41 new places in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 train@@ ees have their first working day behind .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
around 620 applications were to be t@@ ask@@ eted to the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle further is missing to cope with the Ascen@@ ded requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are around 50 non @-@ occupied bodies with the circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; among other things doctors and engineers are sought , as well as forces of the general administration . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U want to take the initiative in the circle , now with the F@@ DP and the U@@ W@@ G the initiative and the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; the management is supposed to work according to the request of the parties &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and human development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the aim is to un@@ cover not only short @-@ term needs of specialists , but future @-@ oriented of the applicants , is to say . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers , and include an educational offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G . &quot;
this already sounds like a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has to do with personal problems , which you have previously not known . &quot;
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is from a regul@@ ative &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ conditioned from the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action to remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes out with his party even beyond the common request . &quot;
he was already car@@ ded in the sh@@ ak@@ e@@ day for a lazy surprise when he publicly presented the staff cost @-@ covered by the staff and the rest of the parties .
&quot; people want to be examined , that all possibilities will be reviewed by leaving a outlet from the municipal working group . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come here at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county government should strive with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the circular cities - a home country , so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way the CD@@ U , who try to pay the employees and officials better than it is actually looking for the collective service for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exact prescribed , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if you switch to a higher level which is oriented at professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have been growing ever more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which to deal with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot;
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to NGO s migrants .
&quot; Italy , NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they should not continue this unless they do not hold new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner &apos;s Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team worked effectively with human traffic@@ kers in a way that ligh@@ tened the illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organisation , which has been in operation since one year , rejected it to express an extensive en@@ dow@@ ment of the Italian Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we can operate in the moment not in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , for October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew infl@@ atable boat migrants are delivered directly from human hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can be picked up , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such a meeting , I found guilty just 1,3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the Ak@@ te of the Public Prosec@@ ution , whose contents of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of the authority of the Italian coast guard , the lif@@ egu@@ ards in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not monitored by any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta above all have a Italian police officers on board who super@@ vis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been declared to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their lif@@ ebo@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organization doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants came back after the rescue operations in Italy , in recent weeks , the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and working with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started seeing light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin outside post &quot; and two teachers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days in Tri@@ als and Si@@ ghts . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed observation points , partly on the towers , of which you could look far beyond the fal@@ si@@ zer forest and the mor@@ ed levels . &quot;
between in between there were always longer periods for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest saus@@ age market .
&quot; again the look@@ out at the viewpoint , linked through &quot; &quot; flo@@ wn &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;

console instead of la@@ wns - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ ars for E @-@ Sport
do the sport @-@ stars sit in the future ahead of computer consoles instead of struggling to fight against wind and weather over the stadium ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gifts . &quot;
these have also recognized the first federal government who increasingly engage in this field .
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the middle of July established a E @-@ Sport @-@ department and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire this very new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is certain that on this move , he is still quite a few los@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; on the coming weekend , the World Trade Association organiz@@ es FIFA World Cup in London for the first &quot; &quot; interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs will compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides nuts and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football needs to deal with the 14 to 30 year @-@ olds , that young people are still going to go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the wounded , all possible markets , especially the Asian , conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ spor@@ tsmen under the contract , one could be present by far more often on these markets than once a year to send the federal government to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; at the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; , &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , like in normal sport , Li@@ sts are established , in which the pros can compete against each other . &quot;
and with the Asian play E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many is the notion of an ordinary person .
even In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ic has long been posed with the question .
&quot; for Professor at the German Spor@@ college School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is funny and a lot of biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capacity . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and watch the diet .
&quot; the first player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but it also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a subject . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult for playing online gaming , and in the scene l@@ acked the structures of classic sports . &quot;
the scientists highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; the players are international on the road , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study of corporate consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsorship and large tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales in 130 million is expected to lie . &quot;
against the almost 2.1 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga is little .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sports is not far away from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advisor . &quot;
international are many countries already further .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez get involved in the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports Competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot of things in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as classes , says F@@ rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Bundes@@ liga according to Dut@@ t has now committed to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in no@@ stalgia to fall , and the old days are to be clari@@ fied , today is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time to al@@ ign the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; you cannot stick to it that only at football everything remains , as it always was . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ ic@@ ide , condem@@ ns &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls to su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 month of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to admir@@ ation . &quot;
Carter was condemned in June for the casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ com@@ for@@ ted .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered in a psychological disease . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red p@@ ants and a cream @-@ coloured Bl@@ use , Carter as with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when they were condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said , it was an &quot; aw@@ ful fact that they are totally un@@ fortunate . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that her &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read an explanation by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is no day when I didn &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and how I go with everything I am . I try , in spite of all my p@@ ains that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters will be there , &quot; says it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she says of the realization &quot; &quot; I will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person to have , with whom I had been together every day for my birth , is a pain that I will always remember for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another , su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon fiber po@@ ison@@ ing in a vehicle .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters text unvei@@ led him that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging you up , springs from a building , educate yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages , which she had sent them in two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eye front of his su@@ ic@@ ide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turning the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
Ju@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was looking for the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they were benef@@ ited by any press from the case .
the case has the legal opinion shared .
&quot; among the few , the Carter defended , the Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in Italy because of murder of their British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted of two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua could run Kim@@ me at Audi Cup as captain &apos;s captain is not acci@@ dental .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a major season to - Extra motivation does not change .
&quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the additional clothing piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself a shared stick to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first use as a Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the One could have been able to run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of coach could also suggest Kim@@ my .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was in the youth play , Deb@@ ian and just chosen from the holiday dedicated to the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you will be distributed to those most ad@@ mired in those who want to keep a lot in the mood . &quot;
&quot; who has been chosen to enter the heritage of Lah@@ m , can only use a small extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m above the field .
&quot; right behind , this is now his position , the white bin@@ de at the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me in this starting form , like the one who can take the Ru@@ ins best in the hand . &quot;
he gave instructions to ste@@ er the un@@ divided tro@@ upe .
&quot; he had the look for the whole , while many others were employed with themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal therefore , its missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ d@@ ded little ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therewith , come to the Devil come out to the services of Asia @-@ trip ( un@@ fold also only ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le in order to fall negative into their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this was all very good .
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the Ab@@ wehr , both ag@@ ated sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried out successfully in the game building a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave the fact that the outcome &quot; was not so , as we expected this . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; temp@@ ting , Tem@@ po@@ Shift : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new @-@ purpose , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me after a few scar@@ ce statements made in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard one interesting phrase in the south : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; at Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ et@@ land pf@@ alz Minister : economy lo@@ wed Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often designed to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the land and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and the Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than one year , in which the new business Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ acks at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the tip of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ es@@ list of the country .
&quot; even this year the ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 the construction will be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the west , which stands in the urgent need for the Federal Convention . &quot;
&quot; aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Minist@@ erial spokes@@ man Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees this for a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the Industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) Tri@@ er stri@@ ves , how to stim@@ ulated by Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the growing German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to base their own company , lo@@ wers the Chamber of Industry . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er sees the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young train@@ ees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; planned is a premium of 1,000 Euro for the highest degree of championship and 2500 euros , if gradu@@ ates within ten years after the masterpiece . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country stays long .
&quot; in the planned road building , be quick facts to create , at the same time fl@@ aws it the land on the necessary staff , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Head of the Chamber of Industry and Industry Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , which wants to set the Wis@@ sing at the state of the country , so far only 29 points are occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to award external offices .
&quot; with CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the accounting system , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of high@@ ways . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
ern@@ ü@@ ch@@ tern@@ d is also the previous broad@@ band structure in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had been rated the power supply in a I@@ HK survey only with the note 3,4 . &quot;

Audi is intended to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ steller faced with a counter @-@ action
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW leader said , the company is the opinion that &quot; it is intelligent options as a purpose constra@@ int , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limiting . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to modify its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel @-@ vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines are considered as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; to install the costs for the automotive manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel @-@ vehicles to install exhaust extraction , take also to what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of limiting the powerful auto firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ duc@@ tible devices , emissions regul@@ ating if a car was tested , but during normal travel conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several attachments were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former director of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the motor development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put to the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was included in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could strain Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the benefit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and laughter against the g@@ rief
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the released carto@@ ons carto@@ ons , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are its hall@@ mark . &quot;
also with 85 marks the Argent@@ inian still and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; during the first years as an artist , he was struck among other things as a character for happiness maps through - which he was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris finally succeeded in breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
and again the artist of cities inspire again .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures b@@ umps in drawings by the sli@@ ding tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing , she works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pupp@@ ets and watches find his dro@@ ll figures continuing much spread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has worked in a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter @-@ player .
&quot; for the first time his figures talk in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange to me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he rather sets up on the TV series , which is produced , like his original names , wor@@ sen@@ less produced . &quot;
Lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is due to the l@@ apse of d@@ rought conditions and due to diseases damage insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the agr@@ arian Institute &apos;s CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence was effectively je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed because the plant has been exposed to climate change during the past few years and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small ornam@@ ental , a micro@@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the play .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ gs not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers but it is also very appreciated for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered , are a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of the black@@ out of the ground , but also the radi@@ ating of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties , which are more resistant to dry . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the th@@ ür@@ ing@@ ischen R@@ hö@@ n celeb@@ rates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the employee of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce members usually meet to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless drug critics . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what you feel safer : they should take their children with the office , which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with pom@@ eg@@ ades , or to leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front side of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ por@@ ter , to propose name for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; there are drug jewellery regul@@ ators , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are suspected , on the hearing list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no retirement of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are more and more journalists are at least 25 , since president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 began to be attacks and threats under Federal Protection and until now there was at least seven lo@@ aves in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; under the latter , their editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its mi@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , on the faç@@ ade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which will be his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the Repor@@ ter discuss its shared topics , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ gins , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has been established a Son@@ der Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office to edit the cases of journalists , according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings initiated . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murder , each year are linked with drug trade and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely provided in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still insist on the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ eastern and even though the terrain is now still stock . &quot;
&quot; without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting of safety has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we distr@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed just to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was shot from his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ fter River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the flock was driving in his car away and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to be free of charge in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ leg@@ ic fields of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ences are struggling to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of twi@@ sted , two @-@ storey mouse @-@ style for drug addi@@ cts that are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interviews with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication likes the children , suspected gang@@ members bought every copy of the output , as soon as they delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to be forced to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , who had published the same story to leave the country in its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its kill@@ ings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues were ann@@ ah@@ er that he would always be there .
he worked as a experienced Repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ do@@ ce as he joined forces with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without viol@@ ating the smoking d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper served a reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and sales and advertising participated . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters loved it to publish hard @-@ going studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , which nobody else to treat . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &quot; International Press Freedom Award &quot; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history , where ever she brought down . &quot;
he gave himself voluntarily to be afraid that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot;
you have to take over the task which falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the Dum@@ men .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; What have you done in the light of so many still@@ s ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ß@@ bird who was able to cur@@ se the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher that knew how to survive . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now ask them , was his love to routine his routine ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also forced them to ask their own assu@@ mptions , how they can best do their work and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their fur@@ tive start and run@@ ways , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
his own inst@@ in@@ aries trust .
&quot; if it is wrong , keep away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the publisher of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be danced ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days ago became known that Spy@@ ware , who is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside two police officers , protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were assigned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ cru@@ m@@ ble building in a mid @-@ sized neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters were asked if this officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen which the Gover@@ nor was not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it has been months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain scenery , where the drug gangs de facto under control . &quot;
for the issu@@ ing of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has been sw@@ allowed on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the State , which focused on the home town of Govern@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local drug retailers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ter made from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which almost spread all political planes almost all the century . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter to write over previous inci@@ dents in this Local , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man got a military over@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; only a few months previously , the readers had seen the Colom@@ ne of Val@@ dez , as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we have known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLA@@ CO &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender physi@@ stat@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for characters and sti@@ ckers , dedicated against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ por@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez arranged a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared after three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; throughout the country journalists have become more powerful , making them written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on obe@@ di@@ ments and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez @-@ accused R@@ ami@@ rez the authorities , journalists sending them and bring them back because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has since then asked that she is again shared by the government , because it is concerned that their anger does hurt their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico was held by organised crime , which took place in the government and a gender @-@ valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journalist , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security guards talking with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
the media @-@ ter@@ rac@@ ter@@ group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; last year more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico minded you , because they would like you dis@@ lodge the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ etas card : &quot; &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer@@ ised and ear@@ phones were in addition to their se@@ perate head .
some stores have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of their directors in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez was publicly presented on the drug card with an editorial article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their homeland or even from the land .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be h@@ unted , as it seems obvious to the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 were murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the escape from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue the work , it is a daily dance with threat decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to that the drug trading brought him fri@@ ghtened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I was re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when at once all began their phones . &quot;
a series of shooting with belt ri@@ v@@ als and safety centers in the vicinity of the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war escal@@ ates how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ enen is close to - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a view of the polic@@ emen , who held W@@ ache to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen founders of the newspaper , the mid@@ finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his mark . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day , in which J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee was asking me to send them to cover the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used Tar@@ ou@@ fl@@ es to rec@@ ede its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue if also a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable Nas@@ horn of a Canadian clim@@ ers have been received so well that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even find that his sk@@ im@@ ish skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said , she could have had something of a &quot; &quot; un@@ ser@@ ene past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; describes it as &quot; the poss@@ essed ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the cycle time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has researchers , which it is described as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved Fossi@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was found near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock in the place , and decided to watch more accurately . &quot;
the fossil was discovered by him Fossi@@ l was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2.@@ 500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy Earth ra@@ ils .
&quot; after all this hard work , the ready result is ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept &quot; , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is seen . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies , the mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant fres@@ ser , although he is covered with an arm@@ our and resem@@ bles a changing shell , probably accompanied by meat @-@ coming din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology that is used as a counter@@ f@@ eit , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , say S , which suggests that it was threatened by greater din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier took place in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marked after the museum technology Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists who document patterns and form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ ors about his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ ju@@ ation , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living in today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs has enough pressure by meat @-@ feed din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution fav@@ oured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ady - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or G@@ ear @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot , what sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was to be exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ y behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ acher of the circle was to have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis organ@@ ically compounds in their sk@@ als also reveals that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the beast about his life , including his con@@ serving Dar@@ min@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , into a river gr@@ ated and driven into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was not as warm as South flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans likely to be much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative skin but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the animal is attached , &quot; Brown Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early rot@@ ary period .
&quot; you do not need a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k period was a time , as giant thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which were on two legs , the earth went through . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of his fri@@ gh@@ tening ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sl@@ ed@@ ed after death in the sea and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was found near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ prolonged din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is complete by the Schn@@ au@@ ze up to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long peaks rising by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant vor@@ es was weak@@ ened by the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the sub@@ sist@@ ence of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this specific specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tr@@ este still receive hol@@ low tank @-@ boards along the din@@ osau@@ rs
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the conf@@ use it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied rests of the skin , still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank @-@ plates that carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
its right front is on his side ; his five fingers crossed upwards .
I can count the sc@@ ales in his sole .
in the storm : mass@@ ag@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
fierce accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous Ver@@ last , kilometres long St@@ aus and G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) are late on Thursday morning at a mass am@@ pl@@ et @-@ age approximately 20 people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; after the first information of the police were between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a plum@@ age , almost 30 vehicles , including truck . &quot;
&quot; above all , we have no information about the exact number of the wounded systems . &quot;
&quot; it is about light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a big performance by lif@@ ebo@@ ards was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the Munich &apos;s naval base , there was about ten kilometres long @-@ back @-@ de@@ au . &quot;
&quot; as an AZ @-@ Repor@@ ter , it came also on the counter @-@ car to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ men quoted , the label of the automotive industry , which now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock , a second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a coll@@ ision between a car park and a passenger cars .
a rescue @-@ helicop@@ ter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing , one sits in the train and sleeps . &quot;
or man is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; comes the Con@@ duc@@ tor and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ an@@ ed , or irrit@@ ates the driver in the middle of the work@@ flow . &quot;
check@@ box @-@ control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the creation of the card @-@ card control .
you simply confirm the phone that you have taken his place and de@@ valu@@ ated the ticket .
currently a test mode runs on two routes .
&quot; if the offer comes from , we extend it out . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of next year , there will be expected to be available on many other teleph@@ ony routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the railway the card @-@ de@@ valuation without creativity . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the use , however , some conditions must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already the most passengers already .
&quot; you must also have bought it via the app of rail , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seating space .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : you get to the train , it is calling for &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
the test customer will then be a button for electronic filter@@ ing .
the tractor rides on their mobile devices a message that driver X is located in the train and taken on the booked seat Y .
&quot; comes the train companion in card control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ valuable online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to continue , keep going on to keep going on . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to relaxed without ticket control through our train companion , ch@@ aired in the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB correspondence . &quot;
&quot; the second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives rail , knows that besides delays and pas@@ sten moves the card controls to the biggest eras . &quot;
&quot; for often , one does not even have any documents in each case , but one of the fellow travellers not all documents that you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the personnel reference or otherwise a document you have to advance .
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between driving guides and driving , which leads to bad mood in the section or big room and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking the creation at the end of time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw@@ numbers on the same track are not yet released .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken to its core .
&quot; just one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ pro@@ se on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which she rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it still lies on the street , &quot; says it there . &quot;
&quot; confused since nobody else had posted on their feed , closed her Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Bro@@ wns alive body that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put their mobile phone to twe@@ et your mobile phone later in the evening to twe@@ et people on the Can@@ field drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the title : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live fe@@ ed where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of prot@@ esters with a rebel@@ li@@ ant dog .
&quot; in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman is his ri@@ fle and crying : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; &quot; reminded Fer@@ rel@@ l to their statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and which we can call .
in that moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in the cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , love and loss , of strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to challenge answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter who brought a flower dress and a suitable crown , to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on drove the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &apos; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for war , what they believe ? &quot; do they remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and see it and be raised up .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience ec@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when she arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area than the activists to the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared po@@ ckets and helped them to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism started to accept Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her comrades , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to only &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ Director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field which is known for its activ@@ ism to death @-@ in@@ mates . &quot;
his involvement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer together with six other people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ oks shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , as I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to concentrate on Ferr@@ an experience - to show that it is the movement &quot; not to a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an says - she proved to be the most apparent participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the in@@ humane of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ er &apos;s history repeated the role of black pregnant women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which have shaped after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ from Martin in 2012 , have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Berry Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; to vote Fol@@ ay@@ an , to remark that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is said that &quot; &quot; this is not a affirm@@ ative type of action , which was selected at Fer@@ rel@@ l due to their identity as the heart of film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , though it was at the front front , because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
fer@@ rel@@ l is binding for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway with a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that they call their home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; yet they provo@@ ke themselves to a ch@@ ant , and she feels committed to this memory since three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , she turned into the streets three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; from &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; Si@@ w@@ ahn &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery &quot;
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ line of the pedestrian prec@@ inct @-@ divi@@ des since the first presentation in 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold leaves the issue hardly any one .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; will be discussed .
&quot; as one to say a bit &apos; gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; This would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ setting ) or quite simply &quot; &quot; Si@@ w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the prop@@ on@@ ents are building that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , of which the other stores will benefit , fear the opponents , that the pedestrian prec@@ inct . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmhouse market hall is , in the 13 direct commerci@@ alisation of their products . &quot;
this will end with the start of the construction work .
gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - while Bed@@ a @-@ room with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; Simone Rooms : &quot; &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farm hall for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of land women are always happy to return . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would wish that , even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market marketed in a market hall in the gallery is coming to the amount of rent .
&quot; however , it is likely not likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : what shopping st in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ y- or supermarkets : I find this super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
one can see how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a neat weekly market , it is all the more important that us at least maintain the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producers and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , shop stores will be rented in a shopping center only from larger companies , because the dor@@ m r@@ ents are often not viable for a ret@@ ailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops there is almost no more and that which is still remaining , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with an Mark@@ thalle fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmers market hall during construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in duration , if the bit gallery is actually coming . &quot;
or does it even create the gh@@ pen@@ st bit gallery earlier to distribute all shops made of Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market hall it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
&quot; when the farmers market hall is used , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ compar@@ ably identical - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of W@@ angen @-@ t@@ up@@ fers and hair@@ sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence of intelligence analy@@ st had an 35 @-@ year imprisonment , after she made public prosec@@ uted diplomatic messages about the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A right simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and away dis@@ si@@ vice , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extrac@@ ted from Mann@@ ing and look out of the 30 portraits , such as anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as it may be interpreted and the inherent detection of these interpre@@ tations - but also created to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been openly discussed since her pu@@ ber@@ ty on the identification as a woman , has been sentenced in 2013 due to 20 indic@@ t@@ ments , including six violations of es@@ pi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison was suppres@@ sed her image , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the Mann@@ ing obviously uncomfortable at a driver &apos;s seat and has a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ ch - with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist portraits of foreigners from the for@@ en@@ ian arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ar fas@@ mel and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um that extract the DNA from the waste to produce a picture like these people might look . &quot;
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a time @-@ script .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg at a press retrosp@@ ective of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she was not able to visit this time and she could not photograph them , therefore they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use became in@@ compar@@ ing ey@@ eff@@ ected in the course of two years several letters .
&quot; they even called one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ unt@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which would be fores@@ een a future in which the President Chel@@ ation would estimate and they would have been able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release was asking for seven brutal years in a military f@@ ake in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome form of happ@@ i@@ ously coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp will lead a war against inform@@ ants from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ eter paths that he actually should fix , continue to de@@ ath@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen at a given reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery written down @-@ written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing called for its over@@ great under@@ line including ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her surname is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , which have been the basis of gender , racial , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and GS , and As , in pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ide by the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological regard , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully bring hope that our gen@@ ome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above Com@@ ic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows teams , as it appears with an open @-@ free phone in hand from the discipline of the United States as King @-@ Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they put your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ ute from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ cope , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was pre@@ valent in the Com@@ ic@@ book , but when they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulations which coinci@@ des like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; that was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic H@@ ap@@ logical groups were written with pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them feel like a crowds &apos; , De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg said of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel it feels like a mass movement that shaped with Chelsea , like the movement which st@@ ained behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of kill@@ ings
&quot; a land@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were sought for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest War@@ rant because of its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au exhibited , like the acts of the Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority of Chicago published collaborative war@@ nings , that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials got a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the ground of the event for dead , and det@@ ective examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them may now be in be@@ ur@@ red and be excluded from the beginning of the Campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal proposition which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. execution authorities on any conceivable manner . &quot;
he added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want he turned himself .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he calls the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a notion of its place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administration of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that said in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and war@@ ts were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the sacrifice and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ recipes Mut@@ ko &quot;
&quot; the Russian Vice @-@ related Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a particular stage meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada on compliance with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ release of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia for the occasion . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list mentioned above , however , that the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities reported the reported results of the alleged investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation into being , since our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main artist of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving in the right direction &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot;

the start @-@ ups which will help your business will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers fail to do the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply no consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Company Madison Re@@ ed operates . &quot;
it has called people from the outside by help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the w@@ edge to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , specific@@ ity groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , the C @-@ suite executives will handle and move directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure employees engagement . &quot;
&quot; salvation said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most discomfort and which managers can have low prevention results - so you can drill . &quot;
&quot; companies come to view that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since then a former employee has published a blog post , which has been speaking to an environment of har@@ ass@@ ings , in which those who have spoken to have been pun@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative busin@@ ess@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and Compliance sector could have value 2020 more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ tible , the company helps to prevent and recognize real behaviour and realizing a growing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convert has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collecting confidential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also provides an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line , with the staff a genuine behaviour . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leader is included , complaints proceed directly to the Super@@ visory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has seized the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ tible . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his team is poorly treated or beh@@ aving un@@ ethical , it can be costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , workers @-@ fluid and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ tible for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve its corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s central finding a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously taken . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company convert Conver@@ tible , problems that have previously been hidden in offices in cities or states that have been hidden in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or impro@@ per internship . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to harvest , ethics , values and employees engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen flo@@ wed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; social media came to its right , &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ t offer your software as a service , and load the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance that have supported the approval of Venture Capital investors which both start start @-@ ups .
&quot; convert Conver@@ tible received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ app@@ hire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; cred@@ itors secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are more than expected from their work@@ places than before . &quot;
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only assign@@ ments .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to feel at a company that heard their voices , and that the work you do , then Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can be reached if their portfolio companies are well run . companies run well if employees are using and engaged .
&quot; if the Analytics tools promise to increase their commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
data on staff &apos;s commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company cannot take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the changes does not come quickly enough , or not at all , can cause dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must have ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who have seen the company to very much on the collecting of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow staff members , &quot; &quot; Are you really heard ? &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; and whom you don &apos;t worry about , why should I do ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Re@@ ed , who has now through monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem over G@@ lin@@ t will be reported so em@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees it was re@@ directed by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the employees , and hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better relationship of workers in a branch known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose your company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA Foot@@ ball@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .
&quot; some have drawn up their tri@@ angles , and show the back full of swe@@ at the first day of the training Manager . &quot;
for a good part of the team these unt@@ a minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are written to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final testing prior to the following morning at 6 : 30 to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; Br@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday was closed . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of the players and it has extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 clock in order to meet the already packed time plans of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise reached from the two days is more than one day , at which the Bru@@ ins was postponed almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood . &quot;
you should ab@@ ide in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add the multiple routes to the player to add another point . &quot;
&quot; we put them tremendous stress three or four days at it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pressed it , they plac@@ id on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think that once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish their practices once the camp is finished , resulting in view of the clear visibility of its fields of an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which is already covered with foot@@ ball@@ ots , which is a protective network behind a tor@@ rent fo@@ e . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sto@@ cked that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will appoint our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people can rent there one room and then adjust there to draw an exercise . &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and from one exercise it is a pretty good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking . 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not so much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to escal@@ ate facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ si@@ ties to fac@@ ul@@ ties of third parties and show their results under the original contribution then the world &apos;s largest online social @-@ Network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it is commen@@ cing with the use of updated mechanical methods to identify possible mis@@ reactions and to send them to fac@@ et aud@@ itor , which may display results of the b@@ ass@@ essor from the original articles . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which many believe that they also have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem also has become a major political issue in Europe , whereas the French voters are floo@@ ded in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan , according to social media networks , if they do not succeed , hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate Declaration in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts check . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization that the stories of fac@@ ul@@ atory third parties are challenged , people want to read more context in order to read well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and sharing , &quot; said Sara Su , product management on Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to be &quot; test &quot; &quot; in conjunction with the &quot; &quot; related Articles &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his messages feed to decrease false news . &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the small Scot@@ ch Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze @-@ music video and was a blo@@ wing for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbul@@ ent history of his cosy seat in the admir@@ al River valley in K@@ ent and now is now inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanchol@@ y . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England , sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which was based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b @-@ print on the side of a letter that was re@@ acted by a double bed in the 1700 &apos;s , he says for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b @-@ pressure !
&quot; and letters always cra@@ wling to smoke , because at that time you are lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself would be there . &quot;
&quot; I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who fought so with old papers , that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; to be honest : I &apos;ve been a little exagger@@ ated &quot; ) , this seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; rho@@ dos spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to watch the archives and the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle to study , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena at the walls and the bottles , the centuries had spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank , whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received only the full access as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes hit a decade later , the staff began just to deal with the archive that he said to &quot; &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; books , letters , letters of the time of English emp@@ ires , cards that represent what conf@@ essed : &quot; you could mean that country conflict would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for the two families . &quot;
guys , leave all his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection will use the castle as a starting point to sc@@ out in the english story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm@@ stead of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a mo@@ il , the 13@@ 80 in the castle appeared in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ fe Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farm arose in this area and I thought , an u@@ prising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ it pat@@ ers who hid the family of Dar@@ rel@@ l seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , represented in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century is represented by his own bur@@ ial mo@@ ckers ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be remembered the cro@@ oks and spend money for things that they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men extingu@@ ishes their debt crises by holding rich old women , I imagine them as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his commitment in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ ev@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a San@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has repeatedly returned from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to come back with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the cover of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has started their campaign for introducing a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau with Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to hold Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan . &quot;
at the end of August it should be the highlight of the campaign a celebration on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday fre@@ ed website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we know as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action , it is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; it is said . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a cl@@ utter promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique use . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ digit amount can be the town of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on Pen@@ sion@@ ings and carriage assistance in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine in Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office seat of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the discussions took place under the presidency of the Government now also the five Vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers as well as the Minister of Defense , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs . &quot;
&quot; in this way , civilians were in the Y@@ as in the number of transi@@ tions . &quot;
the government moves in the military the bre@@ wing .
&quot; the general stab@@ le@@ ef Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air workers and the Nav@@ y were dropped . &quot;
&quot; since the failed cou@@ p , President Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als has been fired . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of inn@@ ate connections to the movement of the exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdo@@ gan as the wire of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , will be in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup d Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of God as &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan &apos;s army really on handle ?
&quot; late February the newspaper &quot; Hürriyet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ att@@ agen at the Military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are some concerns for an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which among other things manifes@@ ts in the abolition of the head@@ line bot@@ s for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big bl@@ em@@ aker in the army and the security guards goes on .
&quot; mid July he Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e another 73@@ 95 workers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed like Erdo@@ gan &apos;s military @-@ teeth .
the gener@@ als of g@@ old earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under appeal to their role as guar@@ dian of the world@@ ly state .
&quot; following his election of his election in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s power was the power of the military step forward , not least under vocation on the reform efforts of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s driving is targeted towards the Islam@@ ization of the Arm@@ ed Forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; was a named officer , who searched for the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is no doubt in the alliance after the inf@@ ants of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the executive structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower the legal immigrants in 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary employment permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers , and will do this by the US to change the way the citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates the candidates who have the financial resources to support yourself and to demonstrate the knowledge of our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to @-@ track track for race track
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the race @-@ boo@@ ing race had been stressed - now it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it is scheduled to be built on the southern route , on which the tourist cars will be built . &quot;
&quot; to secure the future of the race boo@@ ing in the long term , according to the traffic of the Ministry of Commerce nor this year , construction will begin on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and re@@ building the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country conf@@ esses the country to this most importantly for tourism , &quot; declared traffic @-@ secre@@ tion Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the hau@@ ling of the track has about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country is estimated 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , I will currently be finally coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the southern tip as a employer can already agree on the technical details .
&quot; thus , the roadmap , the used vehicles and the quality standards are tr@@ aded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the racing poster will be ordered on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of the past months , it was already been tested in the course of a pilot plant , whether the circuit is used by plenty of people to order it again in the future . &quot;
the route is also highly competitive in parts .
the rise of sex @-@ robot is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t even be crazy , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robot . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) released a report on the development of sex @-@ robot in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ fied professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ el . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex doll@@ s have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin which feels warm - with consciously human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can adapt its robots accordingly to its beliefs &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot on the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would look progressive a st@@ ford woman . &quot;
modern sex buff@@ ets have developed to robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x @-@ robot allows for example to adapt its users to adjust their robots to the properties , which they find appealing like rel@@ ess . &quot;
and then there is the &quot; True Compani@@ on developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; that gives the impression of rel@@ tern@@ ess and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; the website of True Compani@@ on . &quot;
&quot; so you like what you like , and she does not like what you may not like , etc . &quot;
it also has its m@@ oods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; it may be tired , to be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; in the mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex @-@ robot - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the under@@ ted female properties , the adap@@ tations of rape as one goes a step in Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is called here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , be@@ un@@ quiet one most . &quot;
on his website True Compani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy . &quot;
their formation and growing refinement indicate a little dar@@ ker and or@@ tho@@ sis in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as optional assignment .
&quot; most men of course will not hold a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R trans@@ forms its rising popularity , they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what dis@@ oo@@ zes out of the edge @-@ zones , may be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not wei@@ rd or ob@@ sc@@ ant , until them the free market there is permission . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ ass@@ ing that these highly developed sex robot dive at a time in which the rights of women are threatened in the White House , that in the White House there has been a president to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most terrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the un@@ ra@@ ined body and the stolen eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
&quot; the goal behind these sex robot is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star structures ) . &quot;
&quot; their builder want to make sure they feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ ages , the robots are not real women . &quot;
you can not separate or walk from their companions .
&quot; they have no placement or background history , nothing , which could inter@@ fere on independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
otherwise stated : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s wide performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ beg@@ ining of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a binary of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest we were in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp sel@@ ectable relative . &quot;
we are all forced to burst all of us to burst our filter@@ ing .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ ins , a left @-@ looking poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been with the republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , having fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , that certainly is a good thing , but it falls me in a wider context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the exp@@ elling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ en@@ vy way to let us no longer encounter the ones of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still fri@@ ghtened long @-@ time scenario in which Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as an expression of denial . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today by an active no@@ stalgia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the mad@@ man , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact one as a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of Republi@@ can only must be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ ins was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ im &apos;s National Park , and the best three dollars that you spend in the city if you do not need a caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are cris@@ y and the animals are rot@@ ate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - very dark and the clim@@ atic music conv@@ eys this in a remarkable way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite excited about the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; but the Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the carousel , I could have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked them afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to purchase the evaluation with a 15 % gratu@@ ity - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slo@@ wing of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also does pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor wife in the department store is exc@@ eed@@ ingly exc@@ eed@@ ingly exc@@ eed@@ ingly , while I get tired of experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with breast@@ plate from the prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time for a hospital .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to the hospital that he suffered the pris@@ ons , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned because of Mor@@ des after an appeal of prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first dead end .
&quot; he killed ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of St. Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 , by taking them several times by a door of the toil@@ et@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on her . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his friend for a ni@@ ghtly inv@@ aders who hid himself in the cabin .
&quot; prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against six years of imprisonment for guns of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say to be found . &quot;
&quot; the National criminal prosec@@ ution said that they will raise the Supreme Court of South Africa in the Supreme Court of Justice , and the objection could be heard in this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs risk that its sentence will be increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

&quot; the squ@@ at may be different from the other young animals ( chic@@ ks ) , but they included . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished each one @-@ quarters that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; it followed thank@@ es@@ word to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who is always jumping again in teaching barrels , and the par@@ ental representatives . &quot;
the chic@@ ks is now over by the teacher of Sophia Schum@@ acher .
&quot; she leave their students after two years of teaching only very , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the quarters in the district . &quot;
&quot; to conclude , all students end a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
the children were great joy in the children .

software update for diesel cars : what those people have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
need diesel @-@ drivers involved in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates are available for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the gas @-@ behavior of cars of the emissions classes 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives estim@@ ations :
is the new action compul@@ sory ?
&quot; no , the tr@@ aded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the binding updates previously only applies to vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has been arranged the force office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?

the aim of the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily act the car manufacturers at the subject of the environment so far not . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what are drivers who do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE supplies to wait .
&quot; presum@@ ably , foreign manufacturers would withdraw , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
now is a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the A@@ ce feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving bot@@ any thre@@ aten . &quot;

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center @-@ Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution on Thursday announced , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograp@@ her Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be handed down at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp is invited to arrange an reception with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the v@@ ew@@ inners LE@@ AR announced with progressive TV series , therefore already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the participation in the g@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even the means - and that stra@@ ined me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 year old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to clarify their view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , following the former president John F. Kennedy @-@ proclaimed Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;

we make the city live
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to the next year in R@@ ente . &quot;
the passage is already written - suitable applicants are however r@@ ar .
for 31 years is W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he conv@@ eys in the press .
&quot; he reports by varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for its successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time wondered , that so far no application has no application for the requirements profile . &quot;
the city looks for the next time an architect or engineer .
so - taking into account the regular cancellation of the date - still enough time for a development .
&quot; as Has@@ l@@ ach has been well @-@ controlled for the Board of Directors , the applicant has to indicate the corresponding assignment . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if they would no longer do them in any way , people would have to travel to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but br@@ ushes in the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good business climate , as well as a good mood between the authority and the citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the office of more than 30 years , some major projects have accumulated over the che@@ ers with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city live @-@ off , &quot; he is confident about the building and its staff . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ of@@ park@@ place approximately are floo@@ ded .
&quot; the ven@@ ties between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will hit around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates w@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
specially designed for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister large margin .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own construction and gar@@ dener can be quite flexi@@ bly re@@ acted .
&quot; you can move a lot , so w@@ acker , and the design of the green grounds are often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for it what pur@@ pos@@ ing &quot; when re@@ constructions are approved , empha@@ sizes the breaking Stadt@@ bau@@ urer . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ at@@ master has high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; in the end everything goes here over my table . &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing since ten years at Manfred Schön@@ er ( woo@@ p ) for 15 years .
&quot; also that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker says : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to really identify and stay . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good business climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who would like to thank Roland W@@ acker , should be able to show information on the city of Has@@ l@@ ach to study architecture as a Bachelor engineer or Bachelor with specialized architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction workers . &quot;
&quot; on the municipal office stand up high @-@ and deep @-@ building , construction planning , administration of urban ag@@ it@@ ances , city hall with Bau@@ hof and city gar@@ den@@ ei , as well as sub @-@ ordin@@ ates , including monument protection . &quot;
bike on lines cast : southern ground
&quot; according to the police , the un@@ known perpet@@ r@@ ator had thrown the blue bike from the railway mer@@ its in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
&quot; these were so heavily damaged , that the her@@ coming freight @-@ suit had to be stopped . &quot;
the investig@@ ators go out of two male kill@@ ers and looking for the night hours to them .
near the scene there were witnesses a ros@@ y sco@@ er- and a bike riders were observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ st@@ reich , &quot; &quot; Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ r@@ ator had brought themselves into great danger and is also at risk the traction .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the system , as well as the delay of car and the cost of rail travel services , passenger cars could also come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; in total , be the sum of a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern route could be run without ob@@ struc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people were Friday afternoon , two of them amounts to the remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; goods were not falling from , but they did not have a delay . &quot;
&quot; according to the O@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged about 200 metres above . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate could help to lin@@ t IB@@ D ( anti @-@ inflammatory intest@@ ines ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed bo@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United States for 30@@ 0.000 , causes stomach @-@ struggles and blood , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products , researchers found their symptoms , found researchers at the Washing@@ toner University , that the essential amino acid trac@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contribute to the immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ pat@@ ro@@ lean to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that foster tolerance and protect the body without har@@ dened sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result from a inflammatory intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , he was established that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ isation of mice occurs , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ biology , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had about these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ toler@@ ant diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed bo@@ wel @-@ songs , if the same system is also on people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ lined a kind of immune cell that has been figured out that a group of study tastes such cells had , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated , this did not have . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice , had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach intestinal tract . &quot;
the di@@ shar@@ me of the mice have been DNA @-@ sequ@@ entially and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells but without them at the mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they were inf@@ alli@@ ed up a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and they were not developed these kinds of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria aus@@ ed on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune @-@ cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component has been cleaned out of the fluid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abolic disease which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers re@@ doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased around half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice and that most of us will protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ adren@@ al products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory actors . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ levels in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believe Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria had . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the old part , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after Beli@@ eving . &quot;
&quot; however , MAT@@ IC had been excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ ation Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho gave that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic start@@ up also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho its start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent unvei@@ led in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wish to wish three further new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get for me four of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. plane Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US @-@ State Michigan , and moved into the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the rad@@ ar@@ tery the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a di@@ gesti@@ ble for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new proposal for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem . &quot;
&quot; as the wind blo@@ ws : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , the social @-@ democratic Prime Minister are always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; no interference from the party &apos;s central , just no inter@@ wind from the covenant - so was the most important wish of the election . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , the fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt Brandt @-@ House are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial towns . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach . &quot;
there were low@@ ra@@ inf@@ all .
and indeed one by one .
the federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against Ko@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be sure , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber , the Red@@ ac@@ tion@@ werk Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ ment of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its red @-@ cast majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens @-@ Chief Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the decline of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ et to return their mandate .
the trans@@ vers@@ ing to the CD@@ U means a clear del@@ usion of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the German business leader and electoral campaign@@ ing of the Green Party ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; si@@ gh the SPD @-@ election campaign , as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ botan@@ ist had reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the crossing of the Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U without its own ruling majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD @-@ state associations .
and no one knows what is next .
the missions started with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades of the comrades . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia will be everything different .
that was then also - and it was all clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the bar@@ be@@ k , the Düsseldorf lo@@ wing , the party smooth . &quot;
&quot; ti@@ res@@ ome r@@ aps , the comrades in the weeks then return . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next stop came .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD landing , lost on this weekend his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burned . &quot;
and because he made things wrong in the crisis communication after that which one can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z is fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW Ab@@ gas , and its role in the Super@@ visory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese con@@ scientious obj@@ ections have been added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just that , Wei@@ l tried getting stronger in the past weeks ever stronger , in the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former civil war from Hanover , his power in Berlin , was also not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
they let him allow him to be a stabil@@ isation of the party from Wei@@ l .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party internal compul@@ sion , which is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz at all were not at all .
&quot; however , the comrades try to hold its own ranks . &quot;
&quot; your anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the deport@@ ation of parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as Ms T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets have their own car@@ r@@ ents about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party in the SPD @-@ Bundestag ( R@@ N@@ D ) , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; MS T@@ life@@ jack@@ et has not been chosen because of their person as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the overthrow of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on MEP continue to continue . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they have returned their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag , referred to a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the election of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a peak candidate in the Bundestag , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U MEPs add the W@@ ah@@ ler result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called to clear the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there are additional promises of CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
Sup@@ por@@ ters for Plac@@ kern III
&quot; who wants to be refurbished in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives St@@ eg Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave again a review of the past events so far .
since 1991 it was held in delicate refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 the grant was at least 60 percent .
&quot; for in@@ dler , the existing re@@ aliz@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development , not only new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the Government of Karlsruhe , Karlsruhe will give the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum total amount is 8@@ 33 333 euro , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church received . &quot;
what is the development of a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; you will continue to examine as in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of any interest , to be re@@ done . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory could then also move again . &quot;
&quot; the eg agreements on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; Social town &quot; , &quot; where the refurb@@ ishment would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the programme are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of inner cities , improving living conditions and employment relationships and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be dealt with , i.e. the means per property . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for funding runs from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , once again this year the inventory would be carried out , as part of those who will find a questionn@@ aire to fill out a questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , it should be possible to set up the Stat@@ utes that can be started in the coming year with the refur@@ bish@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann commented that every commune will carry out the best in advance @-@ exam@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; it is about to evaluate and decide the urban planning conditions , and to decide when re@@ done and to what extent . &quot;
for the particular land there will also be a san@@ itation notice in the basic book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again , once again and get a picture of the situation , they spoke . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of involved parties . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and land @-@ bow , &quot; where it is related to the construction condition and the refurb@@ ishment view . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information on size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; brack@@ et &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if in the building business premises are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a fulfilling questionn@@ aire is not at the same time a request for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed the fact that the distribution of funding after the &quot; &quot; wind &quot; &quot; principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes at first . &quot;
you cannot reserve any support for later . &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , the photos of the project &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; was shown to make the present a reconstruction &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
brilliant invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip in order to come with a hand@@ movement in house and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he opens his door to enter his office and even start his car with a hand@@ ler movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has conducted himself with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ a@@ es@@ thesi@@ sts in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedures are carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the promotional costs of the White House costs the tax@@ payers &apos; thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helicop@@ ter led to the South La@@ wn for an event that lifts the American production in the last month , tax@@ payers will cost tax@@ payers according to the data of the military that has been left to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was held on 17 July in the White House with American design programs . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials made a tour of products from all the 50 states .
&quot; the helicop@@ ter helicop@@ ter was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the helicop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted that you are aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high level of visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his super@@ vis@@ ors , the dep@@ uty nav@@ el for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived at the South La@@ wn for the event at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that , in case of departure from the White House should be hes@@ it@@ ated , due to the restriction of the hours a second team would require for the return flight . &quot;
the original flight @-@ own@@ ing was found during the event at the helicop@@ ter while the safety of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane .
&quot; out of the records available from the T@@ IME were not clear , whether ultimately a second flight is required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act provides federal state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question that we set , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the dep@@ uty commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a cl@@ ash for the reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts for insulation of government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically favorable purposes is not a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for travel .
but their use only for a photo OP is unusual .
&quot; Tru@@ mp led a study in February when the presidential plane in Melbourne , Florida , taxi service , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements that util@@ ise the use of the presidential aircraft through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states will show that produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said dep@@ uty Pres@@ ses@@ ek@@ re@@ Secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn , to de@@ duc@@ ting the U.S. president in the White House with precise is@@ timet@@ res . &quot;
&quot; as Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 practicing land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event in the training needs of the flight plan for the month , said a official . &quot;
helicop@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ Pres@@ ent support versions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the other prec@@ is@@ ites , which were introduced at the event . &quot;
&quot; a speaker from Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in establishing the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget design@@ ations for Pres@@ idential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to st@@ eppe @-@ defense of the U.S. Defense Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D equipment set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight &apos;s hour . &quot;
records of the unit cover the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virg@@ ina .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the helicop@@ ter is far from this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ payers on the basis of estimates for revenues , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this estimates contain personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the equipment rates for DO@@ D does not include staff costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former pres@@ tige of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helicop@@ ter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I &apos;m assum@@ ing that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicop@@ ter than he had his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ kes with the media via its own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
top @-@ top of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga occurs in the t@@ ell@@ end@@ ent Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow starting at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ me@@ end@@ ent Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
&quot; despite the five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance , the peak of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the meaning for reality . &quot;
team chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has no respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; straight to the rear positions , I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV and above all the imports from the high North .
&quot; their D@@ ane and Finn@@ s can even refer on assign@@ ments in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Hel@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , and Andreas Bj@@ ör@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this is always hard for us .
&quot; you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ usi@@ er team for the trip to the high North stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could provide Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment the currently manages the Chall@@ enger @-@ tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella , not the Bundes@@ liga game , will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec K@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;
the hitherto un@@ defeated ch@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories on the last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could return again to the team again . &quot;
&quot; if it was enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , which was in January 2016 the number one of the Jun@@ iors of World Heritage list , not , filling someone from the trainer by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay den K@@ ader . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy Donald Tru@@ mp is not , when he set up his signature under the law for tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his h@@ ast to en@@ acted the law , the Congress made a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels dre@@ amed against the U.S. hegem@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft remains to pun@@ ish European companies which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the domestic O@@ MV has been financed with other European companies the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea shores in Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the threats is violent .
&quot; nonetheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of oil concerts . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp must act on the sanctions even by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are at the same choice .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen , which the Group could withdraw , and which he really could do . &quot;

&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ Di@@ k@@ iller reveals , is the series of Net@@ fli@@ x for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the Staff@@ s three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest b@@ sp@@ ans of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 company &quot; only with more state stocks and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ az@@ ar ) is its head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) is awarded the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ epe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

roll back : the town presents 46 kitchen hil@@ ar@@ fs
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban pa@@ edi@@ tions the watch will be revers@@ ed .
&quot; on September 1st , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban pa@@ edi@@ atric establishments ( kit@@ as ) again in terms of self @-@ reg@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty leader in the division of youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; we all have been very happy . &quot;
cooked is still out of house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cool@@ ed .
&quot; the city runs in the fields of 46 children &apos;s holidays , in 44 , the children are getting a warm meal for lunch . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ ts , 28@@ 00 Children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; now we eat not only children who are looked after the 45 hours , in the K@@ ita &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 part @-@ time employees have warm meals from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the angel@@ ed food , they supplement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioned the meal individually , give the food out , wash and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group@@ ed facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firm of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more integrated , and it is easier for the con@@ duction of simple , educational concepts . &quot;
because it is about a healthy diet and cooking .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the role of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future of special cleaning lock@@ ers .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen service , in addition to the quality improvement of the chef also the charm that it turned out to be found in the cost of equity and alien@@ ation for the city as the economic one , it says from the press . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces will be re@@ hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the guar@@ di@@ ans , not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , &quot; says the UN &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union wants to engage in managers of the Bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said to weigh the company on the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which is beside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owners Pl@@ adi@@ s said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to know when their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s on , &quot; concern to express that funding for the moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be over@@ powered . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the labor force focus strongly on local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and of the chronic production back , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a fl@@ or@@ atory production success at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ity at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it as we estimate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , with which some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we operate like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic climate , our business is constantly checked and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to competitive competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site completely , and we should change our operations on the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not distr@@ acted in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after spending an offer of £ 189 million to det@@ ach its freedom of freedom , but have warned Barcelona three years before the world attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has been hal@@ ted the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record with more than double of the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out there , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans pro@@ ving has given that the club has always been his best to worry about him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; however , the football world was warned about three years ago from the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ? &quot;
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in sign , so this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish Association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they could not allow the International Union of Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by lost one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

the passenger was born in a state of affairs .
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger , a Mercedes Benz , had out@@ dated a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
it may be good according to the accident that the merch@@ ant @-@ drivers had not noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Review &quot; pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report about the mis@@ use cases de@@ duc@@ ted pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for abuse sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ensures a further discussion of discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication against the German Press Agency , he was expecting from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today Kar@@ d@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pap@@ al Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound aff@@ lic@@ tions about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of processes . &quot;
the Vatican Council &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised that in reporting about violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; two standard measurements . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , nobody knows that it would be prevented by &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts ; but the &quot; degree medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ fia , historian and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the day @-@ day experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that for normal &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
also Für@@ th Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis mean in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; you would like to go to the church and that is a free fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; saw a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; , &quot; to be done with s@@ assy children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for previous decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often de@@ af . &quot;
&quot; quite wrong , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who compiled a reminder &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into shelter , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he vali@@ date the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which of the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg submitted with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; with high plur@@ ality &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it is clear that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. applied by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
especially with high emoti@@ on@@ ality the punishment for the pupils could also fail .
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other alleg@@ ations , many victims led the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report is explained to the abuse of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion . &quot;
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non@@ violence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a lift many students &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who became the Ö@@ f@@ teren hand @-@ hand @-@ hand , if a dom@@ inion has no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate the trial of this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when one makes the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
&quot; he is just eight pages devoted to him , and he is clearly spoken by any suspic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or co @-@ knowing of the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot;
also the non @-@ violence in the pre @-@ school occurred outside his sphere .
&quot; it is impossible to do it , too late , or have the first hint not serious enough to have taken . &quot;
&quot; the domin@@ ance of the gymn@@ as@@ y , on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; &quot; rede@@ mption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents himself an excellent witness , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; , &quot; who was perf@@ ected regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; &quot; always of grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority is worthy of its perfection , and its high emoti@@ on@@ ality , which also led even to che@@ et@@ chy . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only bo@@ wed with chairs , and cast the s@@ laughter and h@@ itting upon the floor , but also ear@@ nest @-@ hor@@ semen over the hair or ears , he has already given himself years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ained and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to its ambition must however be said that such educ@@ ational methods were widely used in the frag@@ rant time , the 1960s and 1970s , for parents like at teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state of state . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually happening in this report , namely the per@@ tin@@ ent sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are the free Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; you are wondering if it was not more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ V@@ I. , that many media have just returned to him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bav@@ arian Pope many who have never understood him , still eag@@ erly . &quot;
the truth is : the report kidn@@ apped Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , the report was reported much about the topic of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also some prolifer@@ ation or co @-@ separation with regard to sexual abuse to load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very much no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual gri@@ ps claims to have become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a par@@ ody for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims be silent .
&quot; if they do not even have parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not at a ch@@ oral leader who would have been quite a colleague of the perpet@@ r@@ ator . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students do R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : one respon@@ dent pupils made it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he could have had timely knowledge ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely knowledge and could have stopped the one perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , to accept that .... Bub@@ ble inv@@ aders or more clearly or opened as opposed to their parents , intern@@ at@@ sl@@ ate , Trust instruc@@ tors etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that it was not involved in advance of the pup@@ il and / or their environment , could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as regards sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore acqu@@ itted by any co @-@ knowing . &quot;
&quot; thus , he may not be dismis@@ sed , not to be prevented or brought to an ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to express its good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was a lot of &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; to read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and betra@@ yed at a huge mil@@ king of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of dr@@ ine , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , exactly this is in turn a abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , there is clean separate : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as , we say once , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir conductors of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which l@@ ad of s@@ adi@@ stic teachers were down@@ right and mal@@ ign@@ ed , un@@ event@@ ful thinking on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have . &quot;
&quot; but with those whom the kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys just to face , when they were already at the domain gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; on this , like most witnesses emphas@@ ise the subject of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was only happy to be escap@@ ed and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot;
what was different at the domain gymn@@ as@@ tics ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but there was no sin@@ ful violence . &quot;
&quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concluded that &quot; many victims led the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; at the most , there is still the accus@@ ation to have taken away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself straight and was responsible for the happ@@ en@@ ings at a school , where he didn &apos;t want to hear , ( so the witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again to 1993 . &quot;
G@@ oss Georg R@@ atz@@ inger followed the ears consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain gymn@@ asi@@ ums that the report even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out , that in the pre @-@ school , the test continues to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; already in the light of the danger of negative pres@@ sions , he recommended urgent progress . &quot;
&quot; that of course was at a time when legal clarity was insi@@ sted , when it had long been forbidden in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that occurred they occurred in a legal gray area , like each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; there was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible limit was crossed . &quot;
&quot; but one cannot say , he would have always been away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the investigation of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
&quot; Für@@ th Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Taxis maintained yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time of time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about from the &quot; &quot; pit@@ man of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to present itself to today &apos;s moral values . &quot;
so the prin@@ cess has been right .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what has been living in pre @-@ school and violence against non @-@ inno@@ cent inf@@ alls , that goes far beyond the then evil . &quot;
it is all aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ working .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take into protection Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his funds for discipl@@ ination and punishment , so ear @-@ rise , and to draw on hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , then it was strictly forbidden . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger era has been Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic succeed in doing so also to language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played just a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not sure that he carried out a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once again : without these perfec@@ tionist , without the inv@@ alu@@ able discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible , from the until then rather nation@@ ally known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of world @-@ tran@@ sig@@ nia , which was equal twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons you alone makes no big singer and a big singer in front of every success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
&quot; what kind of man have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for talks to their book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : thanks to the work on the book and in addition , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , win@@ dy , deep @-@ believers and heart good people from which one could not imagine , that he could not only find a fly of something . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly coming with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ zation , regularly contact him , reading him - he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him today , that he was once strictly limited to them , thus they are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today , that he enriched their lives and took over the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always was a good , v@@ ass@@ es@@ ful teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely respect to which she still look up and who will worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you define it , educ@@ ators are on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad we have overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just a man , just because it is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention , which is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; because the report , which has just been published , escap@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; now the landing areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bav@@ arian and maybe Germany no one would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
