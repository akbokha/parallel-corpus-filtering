<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where young people will meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb which is now founded for the S-Bahn tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the underlying cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Münchens supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this has anyone who had to rain himself, because the car-Navi instead of a tightening road showed a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but that is why they are very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it is clear how cities and municipalities will have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickreppi which one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large coverage map, for towns and municipalities were detailed maps, so-called Urpositional sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">This emerged according to the information provided by the Bavarian suspect administration between 1810 and 1864 and relaping the first Vermessung.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during World War II coalition with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographical record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops served with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: there were today's neighbours who created the idea of a surface-covered Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in fact, Max IV V. Joseph was driving forward the project further, the" topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische surveying administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The jungle leaflet for Munich dates back to the year 1856 and is like all others to find on the website of the Bavarian State library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison from early / Today is the state capital of the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was exhibiting for 21 years after the map, thus 1877, as a Münchner district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Jsendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses subsendlings focus at 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of Bavaria against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the west park is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when Hindoom appears a small disadvantaged card with dozens of lines and numbers: hand in writing numbering Flurpieces from the so-called" "urine" "which was derived from the basic tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots do not occupy no farmers more - but small gärtner of the plant "Land of Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schaub of the Octoberfests, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the jungle leaflet you read in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen not only the streetname" at Gasteig "or from the hill" "On the ventilation" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auervesstraße, people were once bordered to people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner circle-Irrenanstalt" "on the Auer Lüch." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard conducted by Gudden the establishment - that psychiatrist was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig's II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ankhing of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he is also prohibited to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had first been space, later on 500 places has been expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"sometime, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district itentiary in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there has been the Isar-Amper blade in Germany since 2006, one of the biggest psychiatry of Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of the former Auer Anstalt we meet young people in Münchner Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order is complex in 1920 and walked in a youth-home with an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of the east houses of the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children-house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was established in an arquitous conduation to the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in order to be" "Head of Place", "which was called" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one still remained - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business buildings and a Gruftchapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where this day was the pre-work and finished on 5 April 2017 the spatenating for the second S-Bahn."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole on the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil-laws published in Missouri for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national union on the promotion of color-above has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the State according to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which is to come into force by August 28, 2017, visitors and Missourianer, as a series of fragmentary, raced-based incidents in recent times throughout the state, and can be noted here," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution bodies of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, the group confiscated the group, the warning said, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that will happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are lifted because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist corruption against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under fragmentary circumstances beginning of the year after spending during the trip through the state no gasoline, and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Office of Missouri, in which black drivers in the state will be raised 75 percent more often than pasture."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready if there are Kautex items or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hassings in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassinbrecht reporting Programme of FBI, which ranks the state in relation to the number of such injury to the 16th ranking of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law which would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the States immigration laws, the local criminal law enforcement authorities commit to rejuvenate people because of immigration violations, which is contributing to the view of the ACLU to the further rattle."</seg>
<seg id="66">"trips are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but at the last time stakeholders have been used as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Subtle project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisheracher Weidezvn project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture in front of the town.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-grabbed of the Family Schwendemann met representatives of the Fisheracher CDU-Locations, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann gave first insights into its operation, in which he has operated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows, and also many young animals, and in five apartments are accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black-Milk" "is for him the alternative marketers for the milk of his cows, so swing."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only comes regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also called BLHV-President of Fischerbach, he describes the" "elementary project". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't work towards such steep areas not profitable.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area is designed for much work, much mould with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elastic operation and manage these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he has no biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the ordination project and is pleased with the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare would have to support farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "we hope that the forestation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thought of how they continue to operate their operations," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the ordination promotion were fenced in the year 2013 25 plots of eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open surface amounts to 40 hectares, which can not be forced until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half over leaders was promoted, a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"therefore, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of wheat."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you are doing a really good job, without farmers and landlady it does not go. "</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "here are best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscaling-coated line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pasture.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the posture of the bluralds.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR signed.</seg>
<seg id="94">"furthermore, the circumfence surface must not be conclusive (Hangars over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"it is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build fence at almost 16 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the surface area is 35 hectares, the calorie costs are at more than 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">"now, the White House of Trump takes on the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="99">"the safest sign of a regime transfer is it, if they begin to attacking the statues."</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other, so the carefful overthrow Saddam Hussone at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he did a symbolic thrust in a hitful argument with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller does not handle the statue themselves."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators could have suffered him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took their significance, and especially the meaning that you have been written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta accused," I don't want to go here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly properly correct, but as he herself formulating, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the shook words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only loads any old immigrants, but the sleeves of the poor:" your arrogant, your poor, / your beaked masses, which are long to breathe, free to breathe the elty waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "breaking waste" on our screens better was better.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller engaged not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is in fact a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after death on the basis - did very well that they were a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem the feminine figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself gives himself a very different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to move from the right wing this long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great scream Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John of the decessor for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is anyone invaders, but rather an early NeoConservative, that the American flame is in the converted world:" "Lady Liberty goes ahead."</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limestone here on something stolen.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely and at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they were of the depleted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrible trips on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever wish to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">WHC 2017: Neil Black praises schotastic members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two villi belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance-director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member of the World Cup team will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland develops something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue to continue until we find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals to medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team of the team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were shottically or wherever they live or train, went out of room and felt very proud and were motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eiliie was entirely natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of silver medals, which is going to compete in their fifth world Championships at the 400 m-m barriers, says that it is" incredible "is that 16 villi are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the world championship was seven, which have been reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">"in this way, Muir runs on this path and has opened five British and two European records last year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1.500 m is running, is another soons which one should be watching after a great season that includes victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first world Championships than the only other flock in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team's capitals says that they are" huge "" to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special to be the team of surrender is that they had chosen by the other members of the team, so it's anyway a great honor to know, but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chose it, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to rise to poedies."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"it is therefore really important to put it on this homeinment and benefit from it, that we are back in the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will just be such a great atmosphere there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: do not block you a public office if you do not tolerate the entry of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers swallow him because of it, from inner policy to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shouted in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics as silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in the year 1783, Washington:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we will be led as the sheep to the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on it, to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and have voiced their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the path of Governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of an intercom with" "Well, and?". ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republicanarian governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-ranking approval of the 50 Governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He showed a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very skillfully to use Facebook as a primary instrument to combine with his voters and debating his haarless head after chemotherapy in his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore the blockage of persons appearing on the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans spokesman Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governor and argued that the movements of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of Trolles or spammers or haffilled people, who vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders, a teacher, a entrepreneurs and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyers Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hamper, but they asked for hassing."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite, that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hassing and other latest news," wrote them in the commentary section of the message delivery "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea even if a number of people take place on the same topic, then it will be misused by some rather than a large collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the people of Governors were referred to as" "concentrated spam attack", "others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era is easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic, or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in past time when you had the same thing that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical tails and to burn or burning demonstrators and to bring protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly happening digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official that he criticized Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is lamented by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County is last the first Amendment, according to U.S. District James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they joined a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt has received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the moment, Washington had the time of affordable PORTOS a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters swallow for his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington was anonymous trough.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyme like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington's decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petition on the Treaty of Amity, trade and navigation with Britain criticised his office, according to the historic documents produced by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have it swept.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Life living: mezzanine and clevere designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized 2014 by a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something, which was comparable to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">This flat was shown in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square kilometres was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a One-room property with a walled layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine to make optimal ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, they commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that was 12 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces overanother, so the architectural challenge was there to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative in order to resolve the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel is rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the spaces so that they were overthrown, without we had to wigs."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This order enabled Erfan to place two spaces full of height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic coupling window of Retrouvius can get over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illuminations the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of spikes plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Both ends is a short corridor mirrored to let him take longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units room for all stocks and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room may shut the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Assemble kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a gardener.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went there," "explains Erfan from the stahlreinforced, veneered MDF door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is so important, so if you slide the door very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the cleverly use of space and storage room Joanne could win extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate makler will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to increase the ground floor and use high quality materials, which provide space with its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not deceive you in the electric plugs in the walls.</seg>

<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Stabschef of the White House, met at his first working day with leading employees, he set up a major problem in President Donald Trumps white house which he wants to fix: bad information which got into the hands of the president."</seg>

<seg id="1407">"Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors, to the President of strategic reasons of desperate information."</seg>

<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump as a volcano can react to negative press cuts, above all those with damaged leaks, and that he can find out of it where these come."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened in late February when someone gave the president malicious a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of internet provocateurs Charles C.

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employee of the weekly Riodoce members usually meet to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug critics. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what you feel safer: they should take their children with the office, which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with pomegades, or to leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front side of the room: opponent, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter, to propose name for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdomen."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug jewellery regulators, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected, on the hearing list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no retirement of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are more and more journalists are at least 25, since president Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 began to be attacks and threats under Federal Protection and until now there was at least seven loaves in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"under the latter, their editors and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist, wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows its mifinger with the word" Justice ", on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which will be his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the Reporter discuss its shared topics, the trauma, its nightmargins, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has been established a Sonder Prosecutor's office to edit the cases of journalists, according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings initiated."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murder, each year are linked with drug trade and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely provided in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on the violence of Sinaloa, although they are ineastern and even though the terrain is now still stock."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting of safety has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to wasting my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed just to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was shot from his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Zwölfter River "." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The flock was driving in his car away and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be free of charge in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegic fields of the country, since rivalences are struggling to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of twisted, two-storey mouse-style for drug addicts that are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication likes the children, suspected gangmembers bought every copy of the output, as soon as they delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to be forced to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, who had published the same story to leave the country in its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues were annaher that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as a experienced Reporter for Norodoce as he joined forces with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without violating the smoking dote problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest coverage, and sales and advertising participated."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to publish hard-going studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, which nobody else to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce they received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the" International Press Freedom Award "of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, where ever she brought down."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself voluntarily to be afraid that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue on," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task which falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the Dummen.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," What have you done in the light of so many stills... why did you not say what went before? "</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the Spaßbird who was able to curse the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher that knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guaynabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now ask them, was his love to routine his routine?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also forced them to ask their own assumptions, how they can best do their work and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their furtive start and runways, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instinaries trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it is wrong, keep away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell a sense that can be danced... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no more - just as not as in Tamaulipas, VERACRUZ, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days ago became known that Spyware, who is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside two police officers, protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were assigned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-crumble building in a mid-sized neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters were asked if this officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen which the Governor was not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain scenery, where the drug gangs de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issuing of this week Riodoce has been swallowed on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the State, which focused on the home town of Governors."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor's office, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who has been kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local drug retailers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter made from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader who ruled the governing Institutional revolution Party (Pri), which almost spread all political planes almost all the century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors were accused of high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write over previous incidents in this Local, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman got a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months previously, the readers had seen the Colomne of Valdez, as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "" because of its slender physistatur. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to storage space for characters and stickers, dedicated against the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez arranged a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared after three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">Burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country journalists have become more powerful, making them written in organized protests" SOS Press "on obediments and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day the director Bojorquez is gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez-accused Ramirez the authorities, journalists sending them and bring them back because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"it has since then asked that she is again shared by the government, because it is concerned that their anger does hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico was held by organised crime, which took place in the government and a gender-valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-journalist, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security guards talking with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media-terractergroup "Articulo 19" last year more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico minded you, because they would like you dislodge the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the Morde have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas card:" "I am here because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computerised and earphones were in addition to their seperate head.</seg>

<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their directors in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly presented on the drug card with an editorial article on the front page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their homeland or even from the land.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they will be hunted, as it seems obvious to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who in 2015 were murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from VERACRUZ."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who continue to stay and continue the work, it is a daily dance with threat decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, gives to that the drug trading brought him frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and that is why I was reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, when at once all began their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting with belt rivals and safety centers in the vicinity of the resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalates how it was promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">They have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone.</seg>

<seg id="1920">"under the vast portrait of the fallen founders of the newspaper, the midfinger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his mark."</seg>

<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even find that his skimish skin was of reddish brown - and they said, she could have had something of a" "unserene past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "describes it as" the possessed armored dinosaurs, which was ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens of the world. "</seg>

<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved condition has researchers, which it is described as" "really remarkable" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was found near Fort McMurray near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock in the place, and decided to watch more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil was discovered by him Fossil was sent into the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy Earth rails.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the ready result is ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept", "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, the mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant fresser, although he is covered with an armour and resembles a changing shell, probably accompanied by meat-coming dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is used as a counterfeit, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say S, which suggests that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier took place in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Borealopelta marked after the museum technology Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists who document patterns and form of scales and armors about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the conjuation, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shady is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living in today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs has enough pressure by meat-feed dinosaurs, that the evolution favoured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals who use the counter-shady - think of deer, zebras or Gear-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, what signaled that this Nodosaurier was to be exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong prey behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur preacher of the circle was to have been," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis organically compounds in their skals also reveals that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the beast about his life, including his conserving Darmintes to find out what it has eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, into a river grated and driven into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was not as warm as South fluorida today, and rivers and oceans likely to be much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservative skin but also in three dimensions, and the original form of the animal is attached," Brown Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early rotary period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk period was a time, as giant thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which were on two legs, the earth went through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sleded after death in the sea and in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was found near Fort McMurray near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best-prolonged dinosaur of the world, including skin and armaments, and is complete by the Schnauze up to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long peaks rising by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant vores was weakened by the Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the subsistence of the dinosaurs keep his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remnants of this specific specimen are so well preserved that the Hautreste still receive hollow tank-boards along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the confuse it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified rests of the skin, still cover the bumpy tank-plates that carry the skull of the beast."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after they arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Gebprose on the bed of an Airbnb apartment which she rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it still lies on the street," says it there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused since nobody else had posted on their feed, closed her Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns alive body that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," thought Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put their mobile phone to tweet your mobile phone later in the evening to tweet people on the Canfield drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the title:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed where a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a rebelliant dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said that another policeman is his rifle and crying:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not usual," "reminded Ferrell to their statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and which we can call.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In that moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? ", in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to challenge answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter who brought a flower dress and a suitable crown, to Ferguson drove the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning 'about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for war, what they believe?" do they remembered what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and see it and be raised up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience ecatant racism, it is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when she arrived at Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area than the activists to the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped them to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism started to accept Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August, she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her comrades, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in mind:" do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of men, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and its resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson, and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then Co-Director Damon Davis, an artist from the field which is known for its activism to death-inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other people followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brooks shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, as I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was to concentrate on Ferran experience - to show that it is the movement" not to a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "Folayan says - she proved to be the most apparent participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprising personal aspects of Ferrells's life as she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the inhumane of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrer's history repeated the role of black pregnant women in the broader Black-Lives-movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which have shaped after the killings of the black teenager Trayfrom Martin in 2012, have shaped the film" BlackBerry Matter "in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"to vote Folayan, to remark that" the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is said that" "this is not a affirmative type of action, which was selected at Ferrell due to their identity as the heart of film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, though it was at the front front, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is binding for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway with a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that they call their home: "a mess."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"yet they provoke themselves to a chant, and she feels committed to this memory since three years ago in Ferguson, she turned into the streets three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">"from" "dream" "to" "Siwahn" ": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery"</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south-line of the pedestrian precinct-divides since the first presentation in 2009 the population in supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the issue hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"as one to say a bit 'gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" "This would be a dream" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" does not need a man "(Siggi Bsetting) or quite simply" "Siwahn!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents are building that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, of which the other stores will benefit, fear the opponents, that the pedestrian precinct."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farmhouse market hall is, in the 13 direct commercialisation of their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">This will end with the start of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - while Beda-room with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Rooms:" "we have been buying almost weekly in the farm hall for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of land women are always happy to return."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would wish that, even during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct market marketed in a market hall in the gallery is coming to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, it is likely not likely to be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: what shopping st in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, dry- or supermarkets: I find this superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a neat weekly market, it is all the more important that us at least maintain the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producers and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, shop stores will be rented in a shopping center only from larger companies, because the dorm rents are often not viable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special shops there is almost no more and that which is still remaining, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with an Markthalle fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farmers market hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in duration, if the bit gallery is actually coming."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it even create the ghpenst bit gallery earlier to distribute all shops made of Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall it is thanks to the insane many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg no place more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is used, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost incomparably identical - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of Wangen-tupfers and hairsections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence of intelligence analyst had an 35-year imprisonment, after she made public prosecuted diplomatic messages about the site WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A right similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and away dissivice, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey Hagborg has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Manning and look out of the 30 portraits, such as anyone with these genomic data - the many ways as it may be interpreted and the inherent detection of these interpretations - but also created to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly discussed since her puberty on the identification as a woman, has been sentenced in 2013 due to 20 indictments, including six violations of espionagegesetz, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison was suppressed her image, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in the Manning obviously uncomfortable at a driver's seat and has a platinblonde perch - with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project 'stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portraits of foreigners from the forenian artifacts such as cigar fasmel and chewing gum that extract the DNA from the waste to produce a picture like these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a time-script.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey Hagborg at a press retrospective of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she was not able to visit this time and she could not photograph them, therefore they took contact with Chelsea, and asked them if they wanted a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse became incomparing eyeffected in the course of two years several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even called one of Shoili Kanunto illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "which would be foreseen a future in which the President Chelation would estimate and they would have been able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Manning release was asking for seven brutal years in a military fake in Kansas, was a welcome form of happiously coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump will lead a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweeter paths that he actually should fix, continue to deathered."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen at a given reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery written down-written artistic statement, Manning called for its overgreat underline including (the" "i" "in her surname is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation, which have been the basis of gender, racial, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and GS, and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide by the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological regard, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully bring hope that our genome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, also is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above Comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows teams, as it appears with an open-free phone in hand from the discipline of the United States as King-Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who salute from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get gooscope, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was prevalent in the Comicbook, but when they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by their own genomic simulations which coincides like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"that was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic Haplogical groups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them feel like a crowds', Dewey Hagborg said of the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel it feels like a mass movement that shaped with Chelsea, like the movement which stained behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "said Vitrano, who manages the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday."</seg>

<seg id="2231">"companies began to harvest, ethics, values and employees engagement in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen flowed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal said Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2232">"but it lasted until the" social media came to its right, "that companies knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online."</seg>

<seg id="2234">"both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service, and load the company with recurrent fees for the use of their products."</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that have supported the approval of Venture Capital investors which both start start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"convert Convertible received $10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which was raised the total capital to $47 million."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"creditors secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, and brought his entire funding to $60 million."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"if the Analytics tools promise to increase their commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you can find support."</seg>
<seg id="2245">Data on staff's commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company cannot take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"in fact, if a company asks people after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"and if the changes does not come quickly enough, or not at all, can cause disappointments and demotivated."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must have ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who have seen the company to very much on the collecting of data. "</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't even be crazy, a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robot."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) released a report on the development of sex-robot in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritified professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernel."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin which feels warm - with consciously human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can adapt its robots accordingly to its beliefs" "and select everything from the eye-color of the robot on the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, since many robots have the" personalities "who would look progressive a stford woman."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex buffets have developed to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix-robot allows for example to adapt its users to adjust their robots to the properties, which they find appealing like reless."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the "True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities as" Frigid Farrah "that gives the impression of relterness and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so you like what you like, and she does not like what you may not like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it may be tired, to be fixed on conversation or she can" "in the mood." "</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex-robot - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the underted female properties, the adaptations of rape as one goes a step in Frigid (is called here: resisting) Farrah, beunquiet one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then not have a Roxxxy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and growing refinement indicate a little darker and orthosis in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as optional assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men of course will not hold a sex robot, and while the FRR transforms its rising popularity, they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what disoozes out of the edge-zones, may be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not weird or obscant, until them the free market there is permission."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overassing that these highly developed sex robot dive at a time in which the rights of women are threatened in the White House, that in the White House there has been a president to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most terrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the unrained body and the stolen eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the goal behind these sex robot is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar structures)."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builder want to make sure they feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personages, the robots are not real women. "</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate or walk from their companions.</seg>

<seg id="2432">"Trump in the White House is everyone who knows them, including the Republican kinship, having fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"around the dining table, that certainly is a good thing, but it falls me in a wider context that this also brings considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the expelling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalisation "and trump, we refer to the grenvy way to let us no longer encounter the ones of one day."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to lint IBD (anti-inflammatory intestines)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflamed boots."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United States for 300.000, causes stomach-struggles and blood, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products, researchers found their symptoms, found researchers at the Washingtoner University, that the essential amino acid tracyptophan of proteins contribute to the immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestpatrolean to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food not into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that foster tolerance and protect the body without hardened sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result from a inflammatory intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, he was established that a kind of tolerance-promoting immunisation of mice occurs, which carry a certain bacterium in their intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiology, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had about these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of the tryptophan-tolerant diet tolerant, less inflamed bowel-songs, if the same system is also on people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan underlined a kind of immune cell that has been figured out that a group of study tastes such cells had, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated, this did not have."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference between the intestinal microbiomes of the mice, had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">The disharme of the mice have been DNA-sequentially and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells but without them at the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterilous environment so that they were infallied up a intestinal microbiom and they were not developed these kinds of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria aused on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune-cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been cleaned out of the fluid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-metabolic disease which is known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers redoubled the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophanlevels were halved, the number of cells decreased around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us will protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-adrenal products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory actors."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanlevels in the presence of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the driver of the opposite passenger, a Mercedes Benz, had outdated a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident."</seg>
<seg id="2886">It may be good according to the accident that the merchant-drivers had not noticed the accident at all.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"the police asks witnesses of the previous year as well as the driver of the ursed vehicle, to contact Tel. 05761 / 92060 with the commissioner in Stolzenau."</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Review" pope-brother Georg Ratzinger "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report about the misuse cases deducted pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen ensures a further discussion of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "stated after publication against the German Press Agency, he was expecting from former Regensburger bishop and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeried Papal Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound afflictions about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican Council "Osservatore Romano" on the other hand criticised that in reporting about violence at the Domspatzen with "two standard measurements."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the grips in Regensburg, nobody knows that it would be prevented by" shameful and shameful acts; but the "degree medial manipulation," the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the day-day experience and prepares the public opinion that for normal", "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Fürth Gloria of Thurn und Taxis mean in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you would like to go to the church and that is a free fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"also pointed out that in her youth" "saw a very normal pedagogical means", "to be done with sassy children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for previous decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, the Pope Georg Ratzinger was often deaf."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"quite wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who compiled a reminder" "My brother of Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into shelter," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he validate the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which of the Bistum Regensburg submitted with the Enlightenment Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s" with high plurality "victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen sexually abbles."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, it is clear that by Domkapellmeister R. applied by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the pupils could also fail.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other allegations, many victims led the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the final report is explained to the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "incidents of nonviolence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a lift many students" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as choleriker and perfectionist who became the Öfteren hand-hand-hand, if a dominion has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate the trial of this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when one makes the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"he is just eight pages devoted to him, and he is clearly spoken by any suspicion of the mid- or co-knowing of the terrible cases sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the non-violence in the pre-school occurred outside his sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is impossible to do it, too late, or have the first hint not serious enough to have taken."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the dominance of the gymnasy, on which it worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - as literally -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also presents himself an excellent witness," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "knowledgeable" "and" "understanding", "who was perfected regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and" "always of grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is worthy of its perfection, and its high emotionality, which also led even to cheetchy."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only bowed with chairs, and cast the slaughter and hitting upon the floor, but also earnest-horsemen over the hair or ears, he has already given himself years ago, deeply regretained and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to its ambition must however be said that such educational methods were widely used in the fragrant time, the 1960s and 1970s, for parents like at teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state of state."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually happening in this report, namely the pertinent sexual abuse and non-violence at the pre-school, are the free Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you are wondering if it was not more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI., that many media have just returned to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope many who have never understood him, still eagerly."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report kidnapped Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported much about the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also some proliferation or co-separation with regard to sexual abuse to load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual grips claims to have become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to speak with my father or my mother," "said a parody for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even have parents and siblings, then certainly not at a choral leader who would have been quite a colleague of the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students do Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: one respondent pupils made it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he could have had timely knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) timely knowledge and could have stopped the one perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, to accept that.... Bubble invaders or more clearly or opened as opposed to their parents, internatslate, Trust instructors etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear result:" that it was not involved in advance of the pupil and / or their environment, could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore acquitted by any co-knowing."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he may not be dismissed, not to be prevented or brought to an ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to express its good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was a lot of" "non-violence" "to read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and betrayed at a huge milking of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the middle of drine, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, exactly this is in turn a abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is clean separate: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as, we say once, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir conductors of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which lad of sadistic teachers were downright and maligned, uneventful thinking on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to have."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those whom the kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys just to face, when they were already at the domain gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, like most witnesses emphasise the subject of" preschool "." "</seg>
<seg id="2955">"it was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "heavenly" "conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the domain gymnastics?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but there was no sinful violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concluded that" many victims led the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at the most, there is still the accusation to have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself straight and was responsible for the happenings at a school, where he didn't want to hear, (so the witness) had nothing to hear, and then again to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Goss Georg Ratzinger followed the ears consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain gymnasiums that the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out, that in the pre-school, the test continues to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in the light of the danger of negative pressions, he recommended urgent progress."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that of course was at a time when legal clarity was insisted, when it had long been forbidden in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that occurred they occurred in a legal gray area, like each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible limit was crossed."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he would have always been away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the investigation of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Fürth Gloria von Thurn und Taxis maintained yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about from the" "pitman of Anachronism," so the danger to present itself to today's moral values. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">So the princess has been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, who was abominable at all times, and not for what has been living in pre-school and violence against non-innocent infalls, that goes far beyond the then evil."</seg>
<seg id="2977">It is all awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworking.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take into protection Georg Ratzinger, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his funds for disciplination and punishment, so ear-rise, and to draw on hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, then it was strictly forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger era has been Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic succeed in doing so also to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domspatzen played just a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not sure that he carried out a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once again: without these perfectionist, without the invaluable discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible, from the until then rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of world-transignia, which was equal twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons you alone makes no big singer and a big singer in front of every success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"what kind of man have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger, for talks to their book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: thanks to the work on the book and in addition, I really met Georg Ratzinger and again as a wonderful, humorous, windy, deep-believers and heart good people from which one could not imagine, that he could not only find a fly of something."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly coming with how many former Domspatzen are still today, 23 years after his Emerization, regularly contact him, reading him - he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him today, that he was once strictly limited to them, thus they are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today, that he enriched their lives and took over the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, vassesful teacher - a stringent father, certainly that may be - but also a lovely respect to which she still look up and who will worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you define it, educators are on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust a man, just because it is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention, which is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"because the report, which has just been published, escaped him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the landing areas, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bavarian and maybe Germany no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
