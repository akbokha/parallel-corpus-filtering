Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston has not always been perfect or successful .
this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally .
&quot; I always put in drawers , or I am glu@@ ed from the outside label who have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are more likely to do . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh it , that she is called &quot; Miss perfect &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most loved the actress spends her time home , pre@@ m television with loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , is available in the magazine . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Spor@@ tp@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are view@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger had a bit of change with some colleagues on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden sports@@ wear &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a couple of minutes the horses remembered its celebrations , they are going back home in the fast g@@ allo@@ p home . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and that means the riding career then ended up again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament results - again near horses .
he let himself run with his family across the complex of the AL@@ RV on a horse he did not take a photo .
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and hence the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ ting aid covered the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small g@@ ala the Gol@@ dene Spor@@ tp@@ pyramid .
at the awards it lacks the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; deadline , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already served him .
a long one is the 18th winners of the Spor@@ tp@@ pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger supports the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro to the same time .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold US Master &apos;s winner was included on Saturday in the Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
&quot; among the excellent belong the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the jumping Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the palms of the Erhard . &quot;
many of these athletes were on Saturday after Aachen .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy compared to : it &apos;s all about money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; the two US presidential policy are however , however , in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to be rather small in doubt and war@@ ns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to destroy the economy and adjust to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he would be quite different , claims Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; it will make regul@@ ators massive , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private men and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has specific tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would increase to the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the m@@ ts , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost wor@@ e . &quot;
the democratic application implies the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state of the state @-@ of the Republi@@ cans @-@ wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so on Tru@@ mp we could come to internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build carbon @-@ power plants and to resume the carbon density in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; Clinton in contrast seeks to expand and demands renewable energy in its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will make the super@@ power the clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two ri@@ vals are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; TP@@ P , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ de trade agreement , they both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US does not want to isol@@ ate the US to isol@@ ate the international trade but simply protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; the should also be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase her to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage , he says , he would not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months might likely be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , which wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics consider him , so that the budget deficit would be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton is Clinton who wants to know at least from the rich people , that they pay more taxes and their critics say , more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every whis@@ per@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is among women who fl@@ ee alone , almost already to everyday life . &quot;
if they arrive in Germany they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
&quot; each has a baby , which is at the most one year old . &quot;
one has laid their little son in the arms .
he gu@@ ises with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother rigi@@ d on the table @-@ plate .
&quot; until it is seen , that it is observed . &quot;
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid offerings in Bavaria , and among other things , deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in Mün@@ ch@@ ner North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment along with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
&quot; however , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even as visitors .
the exception is an wax in front of the door .
&quot; it is not excessive to say : every woman who arrives here , has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fl@@ ee because of wars because they are politically pursued because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hop@@ el@@ ding to Europe &quot; , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
&quot; for women , there are no reasons for the flight : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sory , hon@@ orary murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
on the run it continues .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water require a sexual act , is not rar@@ ity &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , once they came in Germany , ir@@ re , tells them . &quot;
&quot; here , women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inf@@ eri@@ or and worse . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that , about 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich , are trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not made voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so habit@@ ual that they have nothing to say .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often are not helping to assist , more accommodations are only for them , demands b@@ ills . &quot;
the seven district governments in Bavaria are responsible for the establishment of refugees .
&quot; on the question whether they kis@@ sed from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , reply some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , women alone are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some floors of floors or own houses for only one @-@ standing women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men separated from men .
&quot; in a study that has been published for the committee said , &quot; It is very important that men and women will be separated . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or become accommod@@ ated together men and women , it may take - on @-@ going - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; most of all the rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how very young women feel in need of this protection , one can read at the And@@ hr@@ ad , which is available to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since having been around that there are us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily get a second house .
assistance disputes : demands for new working measures
the dep@@ uty members of the Assi@@ stance have called their union to be called new labour @-@ measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
&quot; the junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to imp@@ ly more labour measures from the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC , said that there would have been a minister to respond to the concerns about the contract . &quot;
&quot; Assi@@ stance and Medical students have voted on the rejection of a contract in July , which was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted against the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Thursday , the chairman of the J@@ DC cub@@ its Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; concerning problems which led to the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in view of the J@@ DC &apos;s Board of Directors , the proposed new contract shall be fully reject and official announ@@ cing for all its concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC has announced a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ating a continuous program escal@@ ating labour measures , which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the disputes made this year sixth place , the first total waste in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that were still reported in advance of the vote by 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ sten@@ cians and Medical students , with that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Minister Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the Treaty of doctors in England would be inevitably introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of foreign banks &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and announce an official end to the eight months of long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin , his Turkish counter@@ player in the g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of the St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot deny myself that Ankara will not want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the rash , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile worked together , and he hardly spoke heat , even for its backward circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , talked to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even further improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard , as if never had something terrible . &quot;
I seemed to be the contrary to me rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin des@@ ti@@ fying , sustainable cooling showed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory scrip@@ tures : the ab@@ yss of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to like Russia in the back .
&quot; this was even bigger , since it was committed by a alleged friend . &quot;
&quot; the Vet@@ r@@ ust will rebuild it again , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the state @-@ controlled media led an enormous , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed as if the Turks would carry the blame for everything .
&quot; most serious officials were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria would have benef@@ ited from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has denied this veh@@ em@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it is time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdo@@ gan as an excuse he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is clear on the hand .
&quot; Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all friends who can get , after spending the last month at a failed coup d almost his ministry . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually spends several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number is reduced by nearly 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agent and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
you are counting on a late tower of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week projected the par@@ amount of par@@ ables , fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agriculture will be re @-@ imported . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry in the West , since it &apos;s reaction to the tried out of power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the continued Gro@@ ll will come across the sn@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the awakening to pull out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
the Russian state victory in Ankara won a bonus to ensure that he called for the elected state @-@ rich support for the chosen state organs .
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep se@@ ated fear of a regim@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one as it once described as a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of foreign banks &quot; : two countries that come across from west and treated badly and now join forces . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are contradic@@ tory . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first talks both president on the press conference spoke , they had not even been stri@@ ped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey prevented it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise them . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found to Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the light of the potential for a perfect Dis@@ aster , when the NATO member of Turkey got the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk together . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
&quot; according to the head of the Bank , R@@ BS is to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the head of the Bank . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS brand have been connected to the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dissoci@@ ates itself since it had almost collap@@ sed and saved for eight years .
&quot; in this period , brand D@@ BS &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; used to protect other end @-@ related financial brands . &quot;
they supported international sport with millions of pounds to sponsorship by the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by until Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock market will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customer service that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a visit tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand , as well as the brand among which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say that we have no global goals , but follow local objectives . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work under these marks with the customers . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that there will be Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship no more and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of the Marche , for how do we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the pres@@ et . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very Cypri@@ ot three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have worked these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can re@@ vise these brands back , therefore I think that the time has come . &quot;

I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy that it &apos;s done with New@@ market , because I am here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers as he fet@@ ches the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a timely break . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ rier@@ esi@@ ght &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reaches this milestone that reached only a few before him .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma enthusiastic fans for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie in a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already achieved 6,000 winn@@ ings , if he would not only be a weekend and Groß@@ tur@@ ni@@ jo@@ ho@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already been suffering in GB for nearly 30 years which is great .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race but in addition he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from flying finishes , Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat since two decades . &quot;
it was nerve @-@ minded .
&quot; a whole series of grand tur@@ ni@@ ers , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and was offered a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six sm@@ ite lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fi@@ de its branches and to return to his own . &quot;
and he is a long time not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin mo@@ ist Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergey Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismis@@ sed his Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergey Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a number of years in the narro@@ west of confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the special commission@@ er for environmental and transport issues .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is obvious that Putin made the President of the President Ivan@@ ov by his duties as chairman of the Russian president . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was dep@@ uty since 2012 Ivan@@ ov &apos;s dep@@ uty was appointed to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the web site of the Krem@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later became a log and staff of the Government of the Government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thanks for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of stat@@ ute , and to support the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV broad@@ cast@@ ers on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and called V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has turned Moscow mysterious top .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as a staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , claimed both men , that the Stab@@ sch@@ ef resign@@ ed on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the light for the cameras , here are only few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power ?
this is currently no one .
&quot; but the official argument - that a man who once was praised as a potential President , once upon a time the Russian environmental policy would like to lead - came to great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks in Putin that c@@ ited on the web site of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation , I could almost say - compl@@ ained post four years at the beginning of 2012 . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been president of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a member of the Public Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , as Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , who put the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty . &quot;
&quot; as Putin , he called his power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted . &quot;
once Ivan@@ ov was adopted after Putin &apos;s second term president of Russia as a third term Putin could viol@@ ate Putin &apos;s constitution .
&quot; but this post was taken away from another , closest ally Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the North deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ p .
it is the first of four wir@@ ing of the &quot; ceiling blo@@ wer &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge .
the main section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ sil@@ le . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Keit@@ h Brown studied at the construction site today and was one of the first , which went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineer with a truly epic measurements in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel , which have been used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the lift between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the brid@@ ging of a pag@@ an activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; a total of nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge on its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first lock is a significant milestone in each phase of the project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the deadline for setting @-@ setting up @-@ to @-@ date and deep @-@ building .
&quot; after installing the last road section , and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap to the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pul@@ ling the northern bridge bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hei@@ k@@ le activity .
&quot; massive as the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , about 6,000 tons , and at a slope of about 3 % to be pulled up . &quot;
&quot; heal , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team is working , tiny - on each side they only bet@@ ru@@ ed them only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; luck &quot; to be alive , &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at spl@@ its on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm after a crew watching the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat revol@@ ved around themselves , and set us the worst one , &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds used to make the boat apart from their range until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ man , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a boat without a lif@@ egu@@ ard . &quot;
they all came on board the coastal ret@@ aining bo@@ ots and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , were lucky in@@ ju@@ red and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat had over an emergency , but this b@@ ust out of the bo@@ ots of the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has won over these men today .
difficult hurt - man sti@@ cht on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; like the police yesterday afternoon , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had gotten the key to the apartment to obtain his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the dis@@ ruption of alcoholic perpet@@ rators brought the clothes of his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he moved twice to them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ ju@@ red by the hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed then of his sister .
&quot; together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out with their partner from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ habitats of the man .
&quot; when the two women again mar@@ ry the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who builds affordable housing ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and Green mean : investors should be taken much more strongly in future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick in the next few years will lose almost 1300 apartments ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing to be a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; to the next council meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all this is about the question : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; the SPD Group of Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , will be able to point 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the convenient apartments can also be made in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great dispute point in the city hall is , however , as viol@@ a : &quot; how do people go to investors who want to build on private spaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing design program , which will cost millions of costs and should still be financed , should ensure incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , such as viol@@ a : &quot; there is no agreement between the political groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U want to make investors as few as possible .
the left still wants hardness testing for investors .
&quot; regardless of what , as viol@@ a , b@@ v@@ ane is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the living @-@ market . &quot;
&quot; if the action concept is implemented , it will ensure an additional tasks in the administration administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built in any case . &quot;
but how does it balances the loss of more about 13@@ 1300 apartments that will be able to run over the next few years ?
&quot; only up to 2020 , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ atory spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased on ongoing ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get back to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western town .
at one fell s@@ woo@@ p the problem can solve .
in the West@@ city run the end of the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments one could pick up there back in the price of affordable housing .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; for example , the number of social housing in the west city increased dras@@ tically , it is far from the goal of the so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there is no longer to share a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens count that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; leader of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must be put into the boat . &quot;
this is more concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
&quot; Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenage boys and children to play no longer outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time to star@@ ing on screens , became the last decade of many lam@@ ents . &quot;
Po@@ k@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally limited to smartphones . &quot;
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive .
&quot; of course I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were built on the characters , which were first created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ern ( later emerged as a cartoon , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of Pop@@ culture , the interest in the release of the game declined in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphones to outside and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons which are tr@@ acked with a GPS as soon as they were once found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( about a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &apos; captured . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , closed down to the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that crosses the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 3@@ 5,000 users , shared the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of launch of the game , the number of subsequent people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to the performance increase .
&quot; many public awareness programmes on health , people want to bring about &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to get involved &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to reduce cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; however , there are also m@@ ür@@ ric toys that must always complain about something . &quot;
and yes . someone could run against a door .
what is it to be ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its attraction and the use will leave with time .
&quot; due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites in the real world and will help with many people on hunting , active , gl@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

&quot; your total output of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ u@@ kam@@ adin A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze statue of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans at Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt in the Swedish during the single majority of the women in the art summer , during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American player who wins a multi @-@ war title , and the fifth , while she has consolidated their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end . &quot;
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years their sports species , 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin from 1984 Mary Lou Res@@ cue of her said that she is &quot; the best tur@@ key that I ever saw . &quot;
&quot; it expected a last review in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a burden @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas will be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace both gold and silver , in the single majority of the women in the art summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;

&quot; although Bil@@ es consisted during their long way to the top , never to have the future planned , that is not really true . &quot;
a part of their mineral exercises - which included its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl expressed by her grandparents as a small child and was conceived by Train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school of school in the gymn@@ asium , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man , became the power . &quot;

police : 3 victims in serial case listening to the music in the car
&quot; according to the police report , which were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl got shot in one of the deadly attack from Phoenix for a decade when they were talking in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a single trip , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator eight shots from a hand@@ fire @-@ weapon , while he got on the passenger side of the car and finally flew with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the three @-@ fold murder did not have been the result of a rob@@ ber over@@ lap , since the att@@ acker did not participate the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in the possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the investig@@ ators set out the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are associated with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , primarily in h@@ is@@ panic residen@@ ces were killed in nine months in nine attacks seven people and two other in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , distributed Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused , the evidence of off@@ cuts they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked to and by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of their injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and to listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which resulted in an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and turned out that it was the work of serial mur@@ ders . &quot;

&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , &quot; It becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves the singing , toys , and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of its anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto , during their pregnancy nothing knew . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I managed not . &quot;
I am not doing this .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course one has left to it , &quot; she said . &quot;
Vincent and her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund is never able to recognize them under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; stated Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund has neither sit nor ob@@ bles up to his third year of life and he cannot talk .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which is Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign with &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical drawing language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented several characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as masks or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked what is going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t been asked for a long time for the pre@@ diction because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful couns@@ el for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects , which were caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
it becomes better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fierce ra@@ inf@@ alls , floods gives rise to rescue operations in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi &quot;
fierce ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to a public on Friday . it is calculated the entire Saturday over with more rainy days .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the lo@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their bank and dro@@ wned with large @-@ scale floods to extreme rain , reported the national weather service . &quot;
&quot; the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that the prosec@@ utor are in constant contact with local authorities , and have already been on the way to the affected communities . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ody of the Govern@@ ors shared with that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multip@@ lied . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten thousand sand@@ bags would have requested .
a floo@@ ding system is used across large parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ anas on Saturday .
&quot; the weather service allowed us to be sil@@ ently , that in this area , additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Al@@ ab@@ ama , Friday was used on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ @-@ breakfast system , while in the area Mobile was still reg@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , all probability are reaching over the weekend of record . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Al@@ ek Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the subur@@ ban near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a stro@@ m@@ down@@ ward sc@@ aling in Ascension Par@@ ish is to be a danger , as these are only slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river War@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , arrived on Friday already by 09.00 to the highest level that was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue team is still some people from the Fl@@ ut@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his bo@@ ck@@ ery , found themselves among those who were saved on Friday close to Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , about night strong increase . &quot;
&quot; he said that him would be another bo@@ ck@@ ery , who would have warned nearby . &quot;
&quot; we are awak@@ ened and the water po@@ ached and exu@@ ded in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years in which she had lived there , never had such a high point of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood &quot; had spread quickly rapidly , as it continued to be heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities evac@@ uation . &quot;

&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a were closed almost two dual streets due to the high water and sand@@ bags for the residents to take care of people who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big floods , which we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in spite of the pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys , that it was still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast . &quot;

&quot; he has done much , his small body was loos@@ ed by balls , distributed his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I simply cannot believe it .
the state of the boy was classified in a hospital as a critical mass and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys shared the sender with that it is expected to recover once again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reported on the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims found themselves not in the car and the police are determined if one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to be a crus@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fle , which were re@@ trac@@ ed to different tor@@ tures , s@@ ut@@ ched the Tat@@ ar . &quot;
it seems that this is a clear fight for a long @-@ term struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk , we found hate . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have been here several armed fighter , who were very active involved , &quot; said police cor@@ ne@@ al Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were made in the area .
it came to no arrest and the police are currently checking according to reports by the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl had hit by a cross @-@ bat on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of the West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
they recovered and the police are still looking for a suspic@@ ious .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I prefer to do under the Frauen@@ oly@@ mp@@ i@@ am@@ ity in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at every summer oly@@ mp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ es , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , who inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Kath@@ oli@@ kin is , ab@@ round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has become the black and h@@ is@@ pan female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female Tur@@ ner@@ es was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising number of Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and America .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the unbelievable performance of the triple world in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone is the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who won in an individual multi @-@ party event for women Gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witn@@ essing the top of this sport , but you do not see rotation classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , all sw@@ allow the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four tur@@ ers in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks that exercising a more expensive sport is and Tur@@ ner are primarily maintained in private trainers who can be maintained for training , furniture , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be desired . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in af@@ flu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the tur@@ ner gives her entire training and that is for the families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started their tower . &quot;
&quot; we need to get the churches au@@ n countless , young girls who will be inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a heavy and easier accessible turn@@ around . &quot;
I have founded my gymn@@ as@@ ement of 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ean ) and trains national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great oly@@ mp@@ ic sport .
&quot; exercising develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong benefits for health and educational and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thank you who motiv@@ ates her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
Assi@@ sten@@ cians want to organize other strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts proposal

&quot; the first assistance companies will receive a new treaty , which contains changes to night and weekends , in order to improve care of maintenance times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A com@@ ees for Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists shared last night in a communication with : &quot; Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it is lo@@ wered the current workforce crisis and administ@@ ered to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks , who still remain silent until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , must be made progress and the time is running out . &quot;

&quot; this happened that a speaking , Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had only made it over the last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y H@@ unt needs to act now to up@@ lift the rise and concerns of assistance .
&quot; should he not do this , so it is clearly done by Assi@@ stance that they are ready to carry further work measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike end of April saw a shed of nearly 13,@@ 000 Rout@@ ine@@ oper@@ ations and 100,000 Termin@@ als , since n@@ urses and specialists were involved , to provide doctors at the strip chain . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through an acceptance of the reform@@ ist contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to pay a better wor@@ ding order for the 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ stance , who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Direc@@ torate @-@ director of the N@@ HS workers , called for assistance to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour @-@ precau@@ tions reach nothing of the only little , but already stra@@ ined teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only worry , hard@@ ships and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we talked to the Committee of Assi@@ stance and responded positively to concerns with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries positive to concerns with regard to the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as delivery , flexibility in training , training courses and gender equality in medicine - a sign of how Ernst it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attack are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after the authorities is recommended to administ@@ ered more people for a longer period of time .
the seed@@ ling medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke and a further heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory authorities nice from the N@@ HS has been recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authorities nice from the N@@ HS has been recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke are caused by accumul@@ ations of fatty acid in the arter@@ ies @-@ fires .
&quot; if the t@@ opping falls apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting that causes blood flow to the heart and thus caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood flow is tri@@ ggers , it can flow through the blood stream and pul@@ ling the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another risk . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the Cham@@ li@@ que in Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ auses . &quot;
&quot; the formation of nice , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the nice health @-@ related certification center said , &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable adverse effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attack and stroke in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to expand the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information about the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood @-@ risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the registration &apos;s throw recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of the Political Cor@@ rid@@ ness leaves election in Muslim regions
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was last year on the release of a government report for corruption coming from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ odi@@ ness has led to wi@@ dened a widespread constitu@@ tion@@ ran@@ ged in Muslim congreg@@ ations will kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored as a crus@@ hing governmental report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , electoral watching and Rath@@ äuser , to have ignored proof of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now a face @-@ corrupt , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set down@@ tre@@ adm@@ ills outside of elec@@ tors to protect voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a reference to himself in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a voters do not have to name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests not removal ink on the finger of a person , if they give their constitu@@ encies to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers should receive more protection says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to congreg@@ ations and decisions of not official com@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves against elec@@ torate , but is also intended to protect the communist government from the broader corrupt and financial bet@@ rug@@ ated culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets El@@ ect@@ or@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special affair decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man to be described after a l@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ished the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in delicate manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations for silence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man &quot; &quot; his campaign should be based on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation , in which a person will be chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
he particularly expressed alarm for frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to feed the electoral system , including the leader of evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ean or ban@@ en@@ heim background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... government institutions would have ignored such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; sensitivity to the eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to control the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activists may be dealt with , in order to stop &quot; constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May in considered , also requires tough@@ er registration tests to prevent the electoral directory on immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to consider voters before the election according to your credit card .
&quot; not distant ink on the finger of a person , once they released their voice to prevent someone selected twice . &quot;
systematic exam@@ inations on the nationality of a person carry out to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic letter .
pro@@ hibition that political activists will deal with full @-@ elections and covers of letters .
the police force the authority to set off @-@ up stations .
&quot; a law change , which facilit@@ ates a indic@@ t@@ ment for in@@ timi@@ dation , according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photography offered in electoral stations .
&quot; requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) . &quot;
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the workers generally enforce that voters go alone in the voting cabin .
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan police , and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case has not been prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; the election of the election of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and its dep@@ uty for a l@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was also guilty of the high demands in the criminal proceedings - guilty . &quot;
he also cri@@ tici@@ zed the most effective &quot; &quot; check @-@ controls &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ torate @-@ registered divisions of the Rath@@ geber . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of the parli@@ aments , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation cour@@ aged them how she looked at it , she went out and put it back to the shelf . &quot;

&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she left again and left the business without buying something . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of ruin out of the place , moved their own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants and tasted them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - it was simply there , fre@@ ch as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;

how to protect themselves with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to handle armed rob@@ bers at the near distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate for your pre@@ dator . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , you should turn off as a first place , so you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the train line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the gun then between your front and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him then with the knee into the body and twi@@ sting , while the att@@ acker is cr@@ ashing pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run and move back , while they turn the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; by att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the throat line , grab the gun and cut it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift at the same time the weight to the gun and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of his grip , before they move back@@ wards and establish the gun toward him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
&quot; see the video , in order to see exactly how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ fers . &quot;
&quot; however , remember that in a room the safest is to reach your money - provided you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;

&quot; he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was just meeting his reputation .
&quot; the only thing he cli@@ pped , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his trial showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies are fresh@@ ly curved hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that refused to reject , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ re over 4000 units was , while fresh@@ ly washed hands one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ d produced the &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number at different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this comes the worst thing I have in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will find nothing here because it is inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company employs Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ d Freez@@ eout , which includes both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories of Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer a little new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we have led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through , so that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian calling . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and by documentary film we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting manner .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I have lost my respect for Ian when he had gotten some of the things that I have reli@@ ed on him , just like the ek@@ el@@ astic Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things when it was easier to bring Ian to put them into and others with which this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; I am glad , that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
&quot; in one of vali@@ o survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents performed lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and bo@@ wel and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products , which included as a lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ al social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social home after a delay with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had terrorist neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and its partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were rolled out from their estate , we found sho@@ cked the property of housing the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were broken holes on , wooden di@@ elen have been stretched , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gr@@ aff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were soci@@ alized and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; It was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people do not have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that had inserted the family , street struggles , drug abuse , drug abuse and excessive scre@@ ams , streams and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house that under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old gar@@ bage was found . &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which the past drugs were tr@@ aded , the wooden ri@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; neighbours said that they saw them on the street , and regularly inv@@ oked the police . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing Gu@@ del@@ o@@ gi@@ o@@ ed her and her partner this week by the estate , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to un@@ plug voluntarily . &quot;
&quot; Del@@ o@@ gi@@ cul@@ ation were claimed from ligh@@ ten neighbours , saying that their lives were made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They were not worried about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood here because it was so quiet - we are not used !
&quot; now where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have been administ@@ ered the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was launched at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the council there were tr@@ ash and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that there is a ten@@ ant dre@@ amy , any responsibility for their behavior and those of their family as a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing takes into consideration . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , since the behavior was extremely difficult and to be able to see their actions for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ ageous to us and have given us the information we have done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the development of some neighbours is con@@ sol@@ ation and the message conv@@ eys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is dropped in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver on the floor
&quot; workers of household workers are now tr@@ ash tr@@ ams , which surround the house . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as sc@@ ales , par@@ aph@@ ern@@ ails and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was given a fine person after they had guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in merch@@ an@@ illa .
&quot; she said that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who was born in 2013 at a car accident . &quot;
&quot; having been without shelter without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many ro@@ bs of the house were lubric@@ ated with gr@@ aff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will enter ten@@ ants , which do not hold in the house &apos;s house . &quot;
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall divided that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that don &apos;t think of the property .
&quot; this goes to those who are thinking that they can take themselves without self @-@ acknowled@@ gement , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never be criminal and toler@@ ate anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Donald Tru@@ mp spati@@ t ″ enormous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Republi@@ cans will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to turn their majority . &quot;
presidential did@@ at Donald Tru@@ mp was now given weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which usually large sp@@ ur@@ ly and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire such a thing as concerns vo@@ iced , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the separate Republi@@ can camp from the race , now the doubts grow in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp &apos;s evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
to blame false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy and again he took his well @-@ known mediation .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gen w@@ ack@@ eln
Utah is usually a safe bank for the republi@@ cans .
&quot; according to a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ or from the June , the Tru@@ mp and his public assistant was present by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp &apos;s front , but not by the distance that are common to Republi@@ can Candi@@ dates in the federal state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also at risk . &quot;
&quot; in an interview of the Senate CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp rep@@ lied to the question as he wants to re @-@ stop the rise Clin@@ t : &quot; just as I have done it so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether to go back : this will be &quot; either successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; he is doing nothing else , than &quot; &quot; the truth to tell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be it right , said Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press coverage , the party should not rep@@ lic@@ ated Tru@@ mp , funds for the support of his election campaign , he should not present any better query values . &quot;
instead of taking the candidates of the Republi@@ cans for the Congress more strongly under the arms .
Olympia : three @-@ year fraud on D@@ oping @-@ Test
the I@@ OC wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arity Commission .
Ken@@ y@@ as Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten is threatened with the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro In@@ gem@@ ach .
&quot; following a beta @-@ trial in an D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee shared with , as soon as possible to set up a head@@ line commission to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; an Ken@@ yan sh@@ aman had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village is a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ amm@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team member K@@ eni@@ as by the D@@ oping controls .
the Welt@@ verband IA@@ AF has reli@@ ed the I@@ OC for information about the event to bro@@ aden their own investigations as a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the I@@ OC , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; says it in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and presented itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; stated C@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan A@@ rap So@@ i . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ cred@@ itation of athletes who stood on the list for training controls of the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i has become over 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics of Michael Rot@@ ich was de@@ duc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he should have notified against cash payments of his country on the subject of dop@@ ing .
&quot; according to the media report , he said to be arrested on his return at the Airport of Nairobi . &quot;
&quot; Kenya is in the I@@ OC after numerous D@@ oping accounts for a long time , under special observation . &quot;
&quot; during the announcement of the I@@ OC posted in more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls before the Rio Olympics , previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the sights . &quot;
the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put pressure on the African country in Brazil before the summer play an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of Olympia .
&quot; in the episode , the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of the countries whose D@@ oping struggle with the rules of the W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won the majority of medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reporting the ARD , the ARD reports have been re@@ formed , that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport bet@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; I@@ OC @-@ member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya , how he placed them in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
thereby it could be proven that in this sport surface area @-@ deck@@ ing and systematically Ged@@ opt was proved .
&quot; as a result of Russia , Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ete were excluded from the summer of the summer . &quot;
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Fest@@ spiele present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the temple of classical , and filled themselves with the role of Mary a youth . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestr@@ al dig the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the ven@@ ez@@ ical Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ts Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he warm@@ ed . &quot;
we are saying that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this inc@@ ub@@ ation , Bart@@ oli plays a little over @-@ known Maria . &quot;
she reminds himself with melanchol@@ y on her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because she is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I have as a &quot; &quot; laugh@@ ing &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a tremendous shift .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
Con@@ duc@@ ting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we left the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ans have gone to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are just as expres@@ sing at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass c@@ urs@@ ed
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed bags , &quot; says the G@@ end of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates short notice with tens of thousands of thousands who escape from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the Chairman of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard ways of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , according to the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish Community Germany expects an mass c@@ urs@@ ed way to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with ten thousand thousands of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the Chief Executive Officer of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k &apos;s &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; because the government had passed away Kur@@ dish with criminal actions ahead of months , were 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the failed coup are still sec@@ ular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will begin to start in Europe if they are further suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that carries out refugees , produced in their own country of refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association def@@ endant the targeted attacks of Syrian Arab , in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities . &quot;
in this way Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exp@@ ul@@ sion to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian sh@@ re@@ ier and Greeks have already exter@@ min@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the German government called for the Federal Government &quot; &quot; as sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in Germany a &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch@@ hunt &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I did not feel safe in Germany during the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len @-@ Movement also feared the escape of many Turks .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany especially Kurds and opposition .
the Brand@@ y @-@ marking as Gü@@ len @-@ followers of teachers and other acade@@ mies the professional existence .

&quot; as the newspaper reported by calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of Justice , the Turks presented the Turks before the coup the largest group of the asylum seek@@ ers issued in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 People and thus nearly 29 per cent of all accepted as the asylum accepted ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there are not those against war , poverty or an am@@ pl@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , so from government side , individually en@@ rolled . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go , where it is w@@ eh@@ e@@ art@@ edly &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from summer @-@ election campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia are not allowed to choose the land day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; 2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; now than so far , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ meeting . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the constitu@@ encies , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so are not allowed to choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; in addition , practical issues : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters attach , ballo@@ ons , flyer , and end up in the end of the votes only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until the 4th of September 2016 , the electoral and last F@@ eri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again make an election campaign just under the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 is the strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting is how strong new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cuts , and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ zing du@@ cts . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive electoral campaign , one sees from its wholes@@ om@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distributed ros@@ es and chat a little with the people , just as it did already know his legendary previous predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Ze@@ ering has got cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel gives blame on the flo@@ wering of the Af@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; have accelerated the ascent of the sp@@ op@@ uli@@ sts , which now probably cost him the nice office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its peak @-@ channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz Caf@@ fier , has experienced as it is when one makes at the wrong time at the right place of choice . &quot;
she has invited twice a ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel and invited by Merkel and Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Nor@@ the@@ ast .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the North @-@ CD@@ U is largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual choice of choice on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , so says Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also , the Union has reported that her on the country has led the base that it has to be very close to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the lands of the country hardly exists . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral campaign@@ ing to his co @-@ stre@@ ak is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; you have to go where it is w@@ eh@@ e@@ art@@ ed , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last but with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
&quot; at the election in 2011 , the SPD had yet made clear with 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small part@@ ei with seven percent in the surveys , should lead the leap into the land day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holidays in need of a modern virtue and place their election in the internet into the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the Landes@@ chairman Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the green choice of electoral campaign@@ ers will be looking for local stimul@@ ants below the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top @-@ did@@ atin , curated straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it also nice . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Corporate : Gast@@ sta@@ etten suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 has been re@@ constructed , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty bad , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff &quot; &quot; tells about the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no de@@ duc@@ tions .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to be moved by the weekend to the half @-@ time scheduled to the south , until the end of October should be finished . &quot;
&quot; blessed shall also be the discharge of those responsible for the construction work , e.g. when it comes to the establishment of containers . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of the asp@@ halt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation within the place relaxed . &quot;
citizens can now ride from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the so@@ fter traffic through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were sometimes considerable complaints , &quot; says the chief management of the refurb@@ ishment responsible dep@@ uty chief Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Road and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many shr@@ ink were searched and more familiar to their Nav@@ i confidential than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to have some truck in residential areas .
&quot; because the speed b@@ umps were not observed , the municipality demanded more to sing the vehicle &apos;s vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable passage , &quot; says King , who made himself on site about the situation . &quot;
two to three per minute have been pun@@ ched .
the fastest was with 77 km / hour / hour at the pace of the 30 @-@ hour area .
&quot; since the construction site , it has become more quiet . &quot;
for the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
do not hesitate to watch the cards on the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led with them to sales revenue , everyone can be asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; , so for other companies , for the refurb@@ ishment has no consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight drop , &quot; but also a that of course , &quot; the cat@@ alogues is missing . &quot;
the streets on the strongest are the bars along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all teachers have made it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was missing customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; the sales revenue extends to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tr@@ ail@@ ment has thrown its operation for two years .
half of his employees have to release him .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have been different . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there might be a financial compensation , the Gast@@ stätte prof@@ us@@ sia from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , they also include the dis@@ advantages that surrender to the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where something was dealt with . &quot;
&quot; with all pl@@ agues , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its hospitality will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been located since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other stem guests can now see less frequently due to complicated transport management , he can understand . &quot;
if you cannot walk away it is also quite different .
&quot; that his tri@@ bal climate came back after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of B 27 construction work on its customer &apos;s role for the greatest crisis which has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist control of laws passed . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick@@ ened security package . &quot;
but what has a di@@ ul@@ atory status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ iz@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable for the &quot; &quot; political partner &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security packages . &quot;
they over@@ ask anyone .
&quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also I attended .
&quot; but as an interior minister , however , he was placed on results and at a &quot; ev@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , a little time has taken a little time before it presents its conclusions for the security of the Republic . &quot;
but the fall for this now makes all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced , announced that a new security agency should take care of the rub@@ b@@ aking communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on air data and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; partly starts de Ma@@ izi@@ ère a second run for proposals which have so far failed to do with the SPD : he wants sympath@@ ure for the terrorist groups , among punishment and jiha@@ dists with double citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still consider this for reasonable and demanding nothing , which does not have any chances in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner in any case . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère too .
they have partly in themselves : he plans a fast @-@ moving process for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention people before deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees who are targeted in the country , should check their smartphone in order to check their smartphone and declare social @-@ media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; at D@@ ul@@ ties for deriv@@ ative asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such , the criminal off@@ ences or their papers deliberately throw away to dev@@ our@@ ing their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legal .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of ge@@ dul@@ ts for example - raises the question : what does this have to do with certainty and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ iz@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to speak that the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg refugees were .
many people in view of the high refugee pay attention to safety .
&quot; and things that people are deeply dealt , now they were not cl@@ ing in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
diges@@ tion is great .
and yes there are electoral struggles .
the Union and the SPD is therefore increasingly becoming a position on inner security .
in the last days there was a high level between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ ment dispute over the equipment of the federal police force , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ iser also call for a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also works here to don@@ ate sounds .
from a return from the double pass he keep nothing .
we have to for@@ ged the discussion in Germany .
you rein@@ vent them is not useful .
and with a bur@@ ka ban he did constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable for the co@@ ali@@ veness only .
there is a lot of things to take care of arguments .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently attemp@@ ting to pro@@ ate himself in internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ el@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled only to caution and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot;
still Volkswagen can be able to use .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery costs are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs around .
on the re@@ traction there are ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e around a term .
Volkswagen starts in the order delivered in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; in the past year , Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ sport can be further developed in the past year despite the diesel building thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets further a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July the nuclear brand VW mainly weak@@ ened in Western Europe , and thereby bur@@ dened the overall sale , as described in the D@@ ax designated companies . &quot;
Bosch sold the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less than in the previous year .
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales of 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s year . &quot;
in the home market Germany the emig@@ rations around almost a sixth .
brand@@ y Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ened numbers from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it used in some core markets due to &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was also deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the car@@ bure@@ tor was first escal@@ ated , there is also further a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected Hau@@ emer@@ ke of Lower Saxony continues to be further exposed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a stand@@ out cluster of 0,@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
the Group tri@@ p@@ ef Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales volume from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW around 2.5 million cars are calling for retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW , the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor service . &quot;
&quot; the Autob@@ wer place the customer after the retro@@ fitting a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was on Friday in business travel . &quot;
cause are legal truths .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen would consider his German customers now a guarantee of coated diesel models . &quot;
these have confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Commerce .
&quot; from the traffic of the Ministry of Commerce , it has been confirmed that this meeting was given . &quot;
VW has to fulfill the requirements of my research commission and the KBA in full . &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations of this will not be accepted , &quot; stated Bundes@@ Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor services after conversion does not take place deterior@@ ations , and all type @-@ relevant vehicle values have been unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business travel .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; Guarant@@ ee &quot; &quot; Volkswagen can see that customers for example half a year after the retro@@ fitting approximately with a motor@@ boat can come back into a workshop - and this could result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the customer interest , it is important to avoid any damage caused by any other damage that does not have anything to do with the ab@@ sc@@ andal@@ ous sc@@ andal involving possible claims regarding possible warranty rules , as it says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW do not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from far savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who parking 40 million euros on gre@@ gate or day @-@ cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German association German banks speaks of an individual case , and does not see a signal : normal austerity &quot; would not have to be feared to pay for their austerity &apos;s imp@@ lication . &quot;
bear@@ ings banks Money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) must pay her 0.7 percent penalty .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September to private and company customers for deposits of more than 100.000 euros on toxic@@ ity or daily bank accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs € 400 in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been lifted 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another , and that he could not be able to utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the bank account and will cause 0,@@ 4 per cent cost , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I cannot put down for any million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will continue his expenses according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation principle .
&quot; cash simply lie in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve experienced four over@@ falls , I might not go the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ quet . &quot;
most customers would have comprehen@@ sively and are rare to other plant forms .
only a few hi@@ ked to other banks .
the cooperative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs at all banks .
&quot; to wear alone , be &quot; &quot; business economically permanent not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for conversion , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ ingi@@ an People - and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their skat@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Head of the banking Association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private customers have to pay for in@@ soles , this competition is too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped with a wealth of abundant . &quot;
&quot; this can be a small bank to the problem , &quot; &quot; if they are free of charge . &quot;
&quot; established in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ like , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; known in the region live renowned actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ cooperative Bayern , is currently no further banks known to calculate one out of deposits for private users , &quot; &quot; said Spe@@ ech Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German Federal Association and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ b@@ anks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to neg@@ atives to go compared to the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition was tough , and he dro@@ ves the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany do not have fallen in width .
destination plates : who does not buy sound records ?
lonely men mean middle ages loving plates .
&quot; before you go to the comm@@ uter , to transfer him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ dec@@ eler@@ ation of men with rotating insul@@ ators , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the ren@@ unci@@ ation of sound records is not considered to have a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the ren@@ cy of physical objects , but attributed to Mid@@ life no@@ stalgia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all pre@@ diction of between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely K@@ äu@@ er group .
&quot; there is also no horror by hob@@ by@@ ters - it has an emotional meaning : older records of records retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera , while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o course , a modest street rec@@ kl@@ ed and wild si@@ lic@@ ates before I ste@@ al , my hands stop and some point of saying as : &quot; &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let us take a look at that .
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos happens slowly at his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic turn@@ around . &quot;
I would probably ask the camera probably to switch the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I followed by S@@ ister Ray ( data ) : two young women , three men middle ages , a woman , probably about 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , question I ? &quot;
&quot; I appreciate already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this record is pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not sent to him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he is now able to buy plates that he had appeared and again to buy items that he sold , when he was young and pl@@ ain@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I probably had something to young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and will gladly spend time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t smoke very much . &quot;
this is my lo@@ aster .
&quot; GMT , 25 , who works for S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers meet , which he meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let themselves be promp@@ ted to buy again its old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people generally have sinn@@ ed around 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to a trailer of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took a cl@@ ash to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
some record @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull themselves back to the stability of confidential sound @-@ boards , of objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the feeding of a void or property materi@@ ally pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort &quot; , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is the case with me as collectors &quot; and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; sol@@ dered an employee of a record st@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people bought a record , they have not yet been consul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy one record , do not possess a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very anxi@@ ous while through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data count : three men aged man ) , has noticed a &quot; trophy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ ator record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it is definitely going . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ las@@ hing , less musi@@ kl@@ as@@ y . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older that will come slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted to the vin@@ yl records almost a whole floor , has an under@@ lined crowd when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos make , Teen@@ ag@@ ej@@ ungs and women middle ages . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing stores is - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester Syn@@ tist , and sex@@ be@@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks son@@ ically lonely , but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ mas are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the business for a few minutes and considered the variation of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a showcase of im@@ mor@@ tal as a big one .
&quot; she does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a loved si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , told that a new generation of record lovers has to be inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the name the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to mut@@ ing , watch a group of young teen@@ ager , group@@ ed for a moment for Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cro@@ sl@@ ey record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of tops of Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees her - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to put them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research inquiries make sure the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in records in Soh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and record lovers , which exist in reality , plate operations and in Onlin@@ e@@ for@@ en , un@@ considered . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through records of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while passing the rigi@@ d sight of an unconscious , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who crosses over the shoulders of the middle aged men . &quot;

French Court provides an offer about A@@ br@@ iss of shops in the jungle refugee camps .
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ ing businesses , in which persons within the warehouse goods , from cigarettes up to ducks ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places would be destroyed , because they would be a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and those of a fire and san@@ ity ris@@ ko . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that stores and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state supported and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led to that the provisional business and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ visional businesses , but the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants could play a much greater role than just people feed , who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the ranges are quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the jungle Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , the community and French classes as well as providing advice on asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; for these children of a catastrophe would be , of which the recent eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two auxili@@ ary organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants said on Friday , that the number of workers in the jungle live on over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in Neu@@ el@@ mm@@ ers throughout the summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new light@@ ning devices will be tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic @-@ effective En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , to the highway sites or to re@@ setting up bridges with temporary Tem@@ plates , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure a stationary bl@@ ender for compliance with speed b@@ umps . &quot;
a lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : his battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded over several tracks simultaneously . &quot;
variable speed b@@ umps as well as from access to time , driving and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ driven state you can move the trailer into the manufacturer with every car with a trailer . &quot;
&quot; so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , it is recorded in the fair@@ er , so that the wheels were pun@@ ched on the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also shi@@ el@@ ded outside . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzer from Vand@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for details of Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various Länder since 2015 and now also used . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities , including the new technology : recently , France has eased 100 pieces in succession , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; great Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening at an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in the handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , desc@@ ends , line @-@ run and ro@@ wer strength to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ ist of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was reconc@@ iled by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they sw@@ allow New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the bu@@ cks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back to it in the final . &quot;
&quot; but irrespective of that , Fi@@ ji would have been a 15 @-@ man team in existence in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a b@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former Chief of England for Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap is going to be done , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the attacks come from a lot of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell , and Co . on , when one would walk in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with still four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai is still a further attack from the right @-@ hand corner from which he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball .
a tr@@ apped T@@ ackle clearance from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve but it has Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner is a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ tar@@ p@@ hide and still has a minute play ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ted by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the GB was still st@@ oned . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB carried out fundamental changes to the half @-@ time , and closed the fi@@ ji@@ bs gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half time , till Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had already been running for long in favor of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ ans , whose fans s@@ cour@@ iers t@@ aps and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame sat the cake filled with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stling of the Pfi@@ ster , the Fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and the GB k@@ ick@@ ed sh@@ ado@@ wed down in the la@@ wns . &quot;
&quot; earlier in the days Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and the Great Britain had conquered South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation . &quot;
K@@ yle Brown brought the boats in the first half forward but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ ing and scored one gate under the post in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ ate by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , insured the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eres gold than with these games and that wants what hot .
&quot; from the first d@@ der to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve who enter in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning , found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the examples which were at the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as she used to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two @-@ hand without tax wife in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , which had such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all the 39.@@ ter is un@@ defined use , which is likewise exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ inside , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ umph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the pack there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wil@@ ful hel@@ pers that make the difference , and no one was a f@@ ty than the coach , who was not able to survive this day at all times when he was diagnosed with it . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was risky . &quot;
I had bladder cancer that is optional and this did they did .
&quot; if you do not do that , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a quite narrow situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio were lucky that he could start in early 2014 , out of season , could begin with what the inter@@ ruption held on a minimum if that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , therefore I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be . &quot;
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge but this makes it even bigger .
&quot; the victory of victory went their first thought to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ fold in the morning with a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a commitment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps somewhat extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only how much me this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person to drink or have a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a tough rhythm , with which their opponents were not able to keep up with . &quot;
&quot; even at the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark joined , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be able to carry out .
&quot; we had a good start at the same time , and at the same time we were not able to do something about it . &quot;
&quot; we wanted no fire@@ works today , we simply wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
&quot; here , it took about four minutes . &quot;
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert Gö@@ ller , goes into retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose linked as a model for the big water producers .
it was a time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in part of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the Aqu@@ forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ cis@@ ors .
the work of the &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian group &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian @-@ wide as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , which was 31 years in the T@@ eck@@ verband Staff , which was 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
at the age of 65 he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water purpose of the V@@ eit@@ ed stone group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of broad@@ cast@@ ers , supports approximately 150@@ 000 Ku@@ bi@@ km@@ eter water and provides 32 places and women with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the churches Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
for more towns and municipalities there are water delivery contracts .
&quot; the current chairman , wides@@ cre@@ ns mayor &quot; &quot; Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller 1985 has been set as a Wasser@@ wart and was already appointed Managing Director of the kenn@@ el @-@ association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extend from the water engineering and maintenance work across office and organizational activities , the budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency ones , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and initiation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ building of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the rein@@ forcement of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stal@@ em@@ ate and I have always recorded new additions , because water life was blo@@ wn and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lu@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart stri@@ des for his water @-@ purpose and he has been regul@@ ating the water @-@ purpose of water than it would be his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group to the nit@@ rate group in front of the Wasser@@ forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; for this , he has received so much acceptance and praise . &quot;
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller in@@ fi@@ dd@@ led Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water sk@@ aters and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a high point of view he describes the fountain construction and the re@@ structure of the compul@@ sory association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were however the pi@@ ping at the high water capacity at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on a 3rd January .
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees all night work , so that the villages with water could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only be sustained once , because you filled the high capacity of P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who follow the succession of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

&quot; the man herself inv@@ oked with us and stated his li@@ fel@@ ine to have shot , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him shall be publicly proclaimed . &quot;

&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a glass . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
it is a few years old .
in the meantime the man is carrying a beli@@ ever .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he can still bear the weapon with you so the police .
who Sven S. sees to give the 110 call .

the victim was born in 1988 , the persec@@ utor of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in Lü@@ beck wanted to first make no information on the t@@ ather@@ land , or the relationship between the perpet@@ rators and victims ; and they confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a T@@ uns . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Tool for the German steel industry
the cryp@@ ted and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains wast@@ ed by extra costs in milli@@ on@@ aires .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens resulting from the industry from the Eco @-@ cost promotion , are of the table . &quot;
&quot; it remain in the release of renewable energy deployment in the component plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , &quot; Feder@@ ative Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fri@@ day@@ . ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we were able to finally reach negotiations for two years .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ ops to generate electricity generation for your own consumption , to the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the steel industry , the steel industry remains an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , I now give a ground@@ work with the European Commission for talks with competitors Com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators used in the steel plants will be replaced , in case an E@@ EG transfers from 20 percent . &quot;
but even these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on its own power generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be determined . &quot;
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel &quot; future &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also during the reform of the emission rights , climate and employment targets are considering the &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 under cap@@ turing and a significant price .
&quot; last year the situation continues to rise , as the world &apos;s largest em@@ aker China in the light of the weak@@ ening domestic demand mass steel rose to the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throwing Chinese steel con@@ fer@@ ing price @-@ dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; for one hand , handed over the import duties on impor@@ ter &apos;s effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have turned up . &quot;
unclear how lasting the price pick up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp continued to be careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ched . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp always wanted to ex@@ clude the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , there were some 86@@ ,000 people at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producer remain careful in spite of rising prices and growing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced well six percent less raw amounts than in the previous year , such as the economic association &apos;s steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity delivered now went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the production has been around two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the Association expects an improved order of demand for the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing sen@@ i@@ ores good
&quot; singing has already accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her entire life : as young girl she was at the school choir , in the teaching studies she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a seniors choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and overall lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; next door , they are doing a good thing about their health and mind . &quot;
&quot; for singing is equal from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard and Hac@@ ete of the German senior Bundes@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ i@@ ores singing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes Hac@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; through regular connections , seniors can make social contacts and cultiv@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; for frequently , social and family structures remain at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to speak and organize themselves , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of consciousness . &quot;
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , says Hac@@ ete . &quot;
because they exercise seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; those who are regularly demanding his lungs , even in everyday life not so quickly from the doll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; even if it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the Federal Association of senior citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint venture had a much higher status , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explained . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs awak@@ ens in older men , many memories are often associated with positive emotions of their youth . &quot;
by Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melo@@ dies even denied themselves denied people affected by far back events .
&quot; in singing , the head is also demanded for a special performance , explained L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time focus on our own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people who live alone , practice so , not only on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one experiences through the singing in the choir , says Hac@@ ete . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem growing through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : when I get for a long time , I will better and alert about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , there is so enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing men , who h@@ ears there when a sound goes off ? &quot;
looking for the right offer seniors have different options , says Hac@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; sings someone out of the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a seniors &apos;s choir , you can just join . &quot;
many cities also offer insights about the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir , can contact the church or the F@@ athers . &quot;
many elderly cho@@ irs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbours around the internet request . &quot;
&quot; who desire has to sing , should necessarily join a choir , reveals Hac@@ ete . &quot;
sing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for any age .
cats are sensitive to the writer of the squ@@ ander@@ ers
&quot; bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , what effect the Ru@@ fen of Katz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has grown on adult animals . &quot;
&quot; to their surprise , the males did not let the males were not cold , however they kept the difference to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal level of cats at the Mi@@ fare of the Little .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster on the foli@@ age of kitt@@ ens , who are in great distress , as scientists found out of the veterinary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
kitt@@ ens also react to the ru@@ fe of kitt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the building of less and strongly arous@@ ed p@@ aves for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is primary in the study , which was published on this Friday in the &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and the tone of the kitt@@ ens was different with the ur@@ gency of their help . &quot;
monitors were a total of nine adults K@@ ater and eight que@@ ens from the animal @-@ preservation of the MH@@ H .
&quot; you were played for a rod of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more powerful kitt@@ ens who were additionally raised high . &quot;
the researchers hold their findings despite the little sampling for expres@@ sive .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
she turned faster to the l@@ oud@@ speaker when this call@@ out of the very arous@@ ed kit@@ ties played .
this ability may be linked or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already been studying the reactions of women and men on baby &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants that they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski is att@@ acking with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is in Turkey a football legend .
in Turkey against one of the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver had passed on a arrest warran@@ t .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time , after the coup attempt to take place an important football match again in Turkey . &quot;
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ al between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line ambig@@ uous : &quot; business as &quot; is said .
&quot; already in case of the suspension of the condition , after the overthrow of July , the government , the daily life of norm@@ alities are not affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
not even before football .
against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver the prosec@@ utor provided a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; according to this , the South America lived in the South America to be a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kis@@ r should be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held responsible for the coup attempt by the president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; the first of this is true for 90 days due to October , in fact that the lives of most Turks , however , has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places throughout the country Erdo@@ gan declared Wednesday for termin@@ ation .
sports is - like the whole country - split in trailer and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club of B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
what the Gro@@ s of the Turks but in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the stri@@ cken rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - whether their heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as proposes .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will take place especially in Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sport value was proof of the Köl@@ ner in the past season under evidence : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions which ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first game time as the top of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him , &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup &apos;s team .
&quot; thanks &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the disappointing season for the record master a reconc@@ iled conclusion . &quot;
after the Pre@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; can also look early in the Europa League .
in the south by Li@@ g it only has to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the trophy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is what we have done and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as ran the game year better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 Seas@@ onal figures as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ri@@ cher is the basis of the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at the moment the AC Florence , among the Treaty and on B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as announced only the borro@@ wed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to go back , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario would like to come to us , he must just say , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club chief Fi@@ Cre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; on this , the storms would have to refrain from around a third of his to 7.5 million euros estimated that or@@ man made clear : &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
&quot; despite D@@ oping , these athletes have even more medals at Olympia in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ took athle@@ tics sinn@@ ers can only laugh it - they fight in Rio around medals .
the subject of D@@ oping remains the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had a dre@@ amed right after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ ged with her start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ il@@ los and hidden . &quot;
&quot; there was a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scene : with a sp@@ lic@@ ed smile she was still sitting in the hall , and had prov@@ oked with their appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was fixed that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
yet there are many more athletes who go to the start despite D@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here &apos;s an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he has been locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympi@@ ad from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered as the greatest publication of Uz@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ad and si@@ eben@@ es WH@@ C in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month lock , after taking the intake of pain through Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation has had a strong g@@ inal pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defended . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympi@@ ad of 2012 as the World Cup of 2012 and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster@@ in from 2010 to 2016 has been positive on the ban stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic testi@@ fies the wis@@ er intake and was locked six months .
the four wid@@ est saus@@ ages in this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympi@@ ad and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive and 21 months been blocked . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement should have been responsible for mer@@ ged Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes have been subsequently detected as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , T@@ ich@@ on lost its world championship title of 2005 nine years later , after having been determined with him testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 for testosterone @-@ abuse .
&quot; as well , the Bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 he was received due to a premi@@ ère of the International sport court CAS . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is lying on the rank two of the world &apos;s list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world police and gold fav@@ ors was tested only in May , but must still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 years old world championship in the World Championship , notices were found on the in@@ ges@@ ted dietary supplements , the sper@@ re of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada fell mil@@ der and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ ben@@ zene in Thailand - Austri@@ ans in@@ ju@@ red - Multiple dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is present with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered cutting @-@ w@@ akes , and be treated in the hospital , but have already left it again . &quot;
their home trip was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether of the other explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ island Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ ity , also Austrian citizens , are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department at this point stand in contact with local authorities , so snap@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok Hua H@@ in , were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police a Tha@@ il@@ ater@@ in killed and around 20 people were in@@ ju@@ red , including the Austrian , three Germans , three defe@@ ats and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two jumps went high , but according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ bing .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach of the popular swimm@@ ers Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was in@@ ju@@ red by police officer . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bom@@ b , which has an urban setting . &quot;
the spr@@ eng@@ ar was according to the authorities in a flower lo@@ wed before the Re@@ four of the coastal police have gone into the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations called for det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast , as well as in Ch@@ az@@ on on the south @-@ eastern coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; one of the connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b attack bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said armies of Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ ava Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it may be too early to express themselves about possible moti@@ fs - probably , it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
also Thai media wanted to recognize an patterns that is typical for the bom@@ b attacks Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is just local Sab@@ ot@@ age , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one goes out that the bom@@ bs were placed of opponents of the ruling military j@@ unt@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities would have received significant references to im@@ pending cl@@ ay@@ ings in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
be unclear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police took its officials to strengthen security around major government buildings , as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ usement quarters . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they usually do not address tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace built over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Adu@@ ly@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the times of this event , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommended to make a result of the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage , the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risks ( security level 3 ) , for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday spent a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military j@@ unt@@ a Constitution .
&quot; in the coming years , this space will have a big influence over the years to come . &quot;
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs should have been a try , while the country toward stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military unt@@ a , who had seized power after a period of bloody injustice , holds itself good , the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not have been able to get a grip on the handle for years in the far south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago in Bangkok the attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shooter 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t appeal of the younger history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ arian movement &quot; &quot; is at the visor of the Federal Council for Constitutional protection . &quot;
following multiple countries also the Constitutional Court have also posed the constitu@@ ent of the group under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ arian movement &apos; cl@@ ue for aspirations against the free @-@ democratic fundamental order , &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , Zu@@ w@@ anders Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ using in the extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we observe the movement now . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ arian movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is opposing &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controll@@ able mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by trans@@ estr@@ ang@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; Ob@@ jects in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority have been closely coordinated with the countries in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ arian movement &apos; try to get their target audience , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , we are trying to address extre@@ mi@@ sts to speak with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ le music . &quot;
the ties of Islam@@ ists equally as legal claims .
this is not a praying advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda should speak the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are in a special way sus@@ cep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , there was reports from several Bundes@@ länder reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ arian &quot; &quot; to Af@@ for@@ politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he has no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist are changing , their destination area changes and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; it is decisive , so if such individuals have controlled influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and Refu@@ ge@@ es , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed that it can be legal structures in recent years .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
&quot; it may well be that further legal groups or small groups make up the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nation@@ wide or across Europe @-@ wide control of rect@@ angle @-@ nation@@ alism is not recognizable . &quot;
the former groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried , Ma@@ ate expressed that many over@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people who were not appearing in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the worrying .
many of the susp@@ ects at attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as crimin@@ als to politically motivated prosec@@ utor or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; many people therefore have committed crimes committed previously with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which then have been radi@@ cal@@ ised by far right @-@ right @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ ks or world grain the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center schw@@ amm the easily over@@ weigh@@ ed swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he did not see more in the TV @-@ pictures . &quot;
he disappeared and simply - no matter how far the detail was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ ed then became the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old had ended with a back of 48 seconds and won the 5@@ 9th prize of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather not a spor@@ ty figure that attracted international media attention .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special start@@ up from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; since in offices , most spor@@ tsmen run , Have just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly made the first nickname of the lap .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ BEL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in the rest of a &quot; &quot; bo@@ ars &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made about him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he didn &apos;t work with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of the style , has not played a role . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney run the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ b@@ ani for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea which he had to stand alone over 100 metres of freedom .
fr@@ ene@@ tically was fired at the time of M@@ ous@@ sam@@ b@@ ani back then .
&quot; the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old came to swim only eight months before , and had never taken such a long distance before the competition . &quot;

G@@ FR@@ P @-@ lead to dis@@ closing business figures
the consumer @-@ based company Gf@@ K shares his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the set@@ ters came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K left , that the chair of Vor@@ ar@@ sch@@ ef Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes all the more uncertain , the longer the successes were promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of Nuremberg &apos;s market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ continued business figures and the resign@@ ation of the company &apos;s guidance represents the worldwide number five of the industry before a personalized new start .
G@@ FR@@ P &apos;s Chief wants to leave the company for the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Super@@ visory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has been removed from the board of the board with effect on 12 September .
&quot; the management of the board will be held by the Executive Board of Gerhard Haus@@ smann , distributed the company . &quot;

Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .

&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , the police shared with . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driving of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to so@@ ak its indications according to a counter , the partly went on the counter . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons were not able to leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade fre@@ es the in@@ mates .
six lif@@ ebo@@ cars and a not@@ ebooks came to the accident on the national road 2 .
the immediate travelers were brought back by a line bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ heard district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there you should wait for a spare part of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called for the trucks and possible witnesses to register with the police .
&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic meters of water are from 1st October 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 . for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will be able to increase once again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a dup@@ licate calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , was noted in the approval of the budget through the land and Kul@@ mb@@ ach that covers for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
&quot; the market of Kas@@ endorf is committed to a legal basis , to run the facilities costly . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial gear@@ box of Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg , and Zul@@ tenberg must rely deeper into the money bag . &quot;
the ag@@ it@@ ated increase are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt presented the body , a new@@ cal@@ ulation of the charges for se@@ wage systems of the market . &quot;
&quot; during the period of October 2016 to September 2020 , Over@@ - or cap@@ tions from the previous cal@@ cular period exp@@ ires . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vi@@ ous con@@ ju@@ red increased stat@@ s provides that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the small distribution of distribution , for example , would have a considerable contribution to the repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater is slightly declined in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , at all three plants , the backward one of the three units were not least due to its age of age and repar@@ ations in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ ding ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt re@@ jects that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf had to be exchanged due to damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Which space , which had to over@@ hau@@ l almost 20 years old , and in the pond situation Lop@@ p had to be built after nearly 20 years in operation of the first shar@@ pen@@ ing pond , and an additional venti@@ l@@ ator can be installed in order to keep the waterproof guidelines in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the advanced super@@ vis@@ ors and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 still significantly below the current level . &quot;
Stein@@ häuser made clear that at the low wast@@ ew@@ ater case in the three systems uses the expenses of operation and maintenance .
&quot; this was , added Schmidt , the market parish of large entertainment costs in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will remain prec@@ arious after the view of stone houses on duration , especially since one could not extend the supply of the wast@@ ew@@ ater Federation Fries@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to expand these plants , because it is dedicated to defic@@ its facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s books for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria increased in July 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0.2 % . &quot;
the annual stag@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 , the inflation rate was compared to December 2015 ) was 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was 0.7 % . &quot;

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ effect as asi@@ an caric@@ ature cri@@ tici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired but some observers say that it is ours .
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million everyday users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already as absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can transform herself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure resulting from a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ clean , peculi@@ ar tools created more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps come to the public .
&quot; Snap@@ chat filters have drawn more criticism in the past , in which it was accused , that the app Black@@ face stimul@@ ates or white skin as a beauty ideal prop@@ agate would act . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users sm@@ ote a filter that gave them mu@@ d@@ elling , false teeth and impro@@ per che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; yellow &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they asked if this repeated contro@@ versy has been referred to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat spoke that it would have the feature disabled . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was meant as hom@@ age to Ani@@ me @-@ characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , the r@@ attle sm experienced , reminded of the filter of injury c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others reject the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et has been widely distributed over the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; injury and eased were told . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter @-@ position of a very conf@@ lic@@ ted Asian caric@@ ature and the filter@@ ing effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not viable , but that the face @-@ face was drawn into the radi@@ ant extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ b .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ ff and integration process , from meeting rooms up to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ chat great audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in matters of race as their older counter@@ players - might be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; if one image is generated by Snap@@ shots , it is much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided that works as product management and engineering , for medium , her Snap@@ chat account calls for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that rac@@ en@@ related contro@@ versy can reflect a lack of diversity in the settings in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u cri@@ tici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leaders and ended their attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their employees , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours who work there , but not in positions that they are safe or comfortable to say what to say against it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company releases no numbers for the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday there is Snap@@ chat starting to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently set a personnel responsible , which focuses on under@@ lined populations and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said in turn her Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I wonder whether they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
military leadership of ISIS &apos; intelligence information ; presents Committee of Congress
&quot; military depen@@ dents of the United States Central Command changed im@@ pris@@ es@@ pres@@ sive information to draw an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual condition committee of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the dispute , intelligence agencies and the Wehr@@ budget@@ ary co , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence services , reported how pre @-@ term their estimates on American efforts changed in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence services , which were evaluated by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com coma , signed regularly a positive picture by the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; announced a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ cans Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top head of the organization .
the ten @-@ round report shows detailed permanent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Arm@@ ed Forces .
&quot; although there is no direct indications that govern@@ ors have given the statements made under Obama instructions , how analy@@ st looked at the pressure from its predec@@ essors , an optimal picture from the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements from Congress are clearly positive than the facts corresponding to the Congress . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com An@@ ders publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ consul@@ s already started in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ cans of Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the peaks of Central Command changed the thou@@ ghtful reports to play the danger of IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans prov@@ oked the Task Force into Life after giving them the anal@@ ysts were worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detail during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investig@@ ators of the Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the general in@@ spec@@ ter of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the news al@@ erts published on Thursday released their own findings that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com represents an over@@ ly restricted process for creating im@@ pris@@ es@@ sm@@ ents at IS@@ IL and the Iraqi safety services , &quot; the highest ranked democr@@ at in the com@@ w@@ ee , member of the Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Ship , announced in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; del@@ ayed the publication of im@@ pris@@ oned reports , &quot; announced the morality of anal@@ ysts and &apos; gave a little space for so@@ fter opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Ship and Democrats gave , no references to an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st in terms of a &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by issu@@ ing the Pentagon by the Pentagon written by the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Secretary of Defence would have no reports of Congress , while issu@@ ing the general in@@ spec@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence will welcome the contro@@ versy discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; investigations on the question of a successful air campaign among American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for hon@@ ours of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the hearing formations about the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the former government saw under George W. Bush on the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts at present and little time on it , to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker finds no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ vis@@ ory refin@@ eries had taken into operation since they sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Council for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won fourth match in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner about Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember this ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not among the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; but that is , however , the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place that after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ be@@ aten . &quot;
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which both of the two teams in their group will have six teams each with the first and second place . &quot;
&quot; the first @-@ placed , the strong Dutch can take a little longer from the path that leads to the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game may be released on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 squares . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ x@@ el University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 where for her and her team went all wrong .
&quot; in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham was an English , coach of national teams and thus the things began to pay for better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work of work in London , which we now have . &quot;
we can rip off the ruin .
&quot; on Thursday night , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ ri@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back envel@@ ope . &quot;
&quot; India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team was surprising and stood out of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until they took their hands into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she complet@@ es a Spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left side , then moved to the middle and l@@ up@@ beat the ball into the gate around the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 guidance . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs which had previously had to book a gate at any of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the next game will be on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling @-@ resistant and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid stag@@ gering between competition and quest . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic tor@@ ches itself would be a burning st@@ ab , which will protect from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swimm@@ ers for the turbul@@ ent to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ eten . &quot;
&quot; you may not listen to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue , without going to hear about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ading y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who has been playing for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could well be listed under these known names , built up to Prime Time , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even f@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the Olympic tramp@@ oline by gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame does not illuminated every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports , which are not generally recognized : air guns , Arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the fli@@ ppers and may it reign .
&quot; but if I might make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me direct attention to the discreet charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline has been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it was in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so pointed out that many that I asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ i . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US had sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the tramp@@ oline and had a athletes until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans who share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline has a certain outside conductor , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear suitable for a Clo@@ wn school than that sounds to the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a refres@@ hed enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
it has humor@@ ous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never end@@ setting ri@@ ver@@ y - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving that combines two sports that it essentially combines .
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; jumping winner jumping on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( spin , h@@ ens and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic apro@@ gram according to execution , difficulty of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are going to compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common oly@@ mp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; medalli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes going back and back , down and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they are hunting not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but also in television transmission : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ast@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even sti@@ r a audience of tears . &quot;
but it is also what I like to look at the look of these games as something ti@@ ring .
&quot; of this , the tramp@@ oline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ box is above .
an upward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seemingly he@@ el@@ os like an astr@@ on@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no h@@ tic attack on the target , no cur@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abolition of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time : the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC is the end @-@ round as part of a after@@ no@@ blo@@ c on both days from 2@@ pm .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked at the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ ain@@ es and the object of mascul@@ ine athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his home rin@@ se , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a Verb@@ und of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who challenge political changes in Ethiopia and urged to violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ ested during the cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia precisely to break together ?
&quot; in the last ten years it was one of the most stabil@@ ising countries of Africa , a solid association with a fast growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months the protests against the government broke out the country and expanding themselves in more and more areas .
last week stor@@ my thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot on zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; changing videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show like security @-@ people young people with st@@ aves , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN @-@ Authority of Human Rights is now asking a close investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and in future it becomes even harder , &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new extension in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy , human rights organisations have continuously led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited , where dis@@ si@@ dents were effective to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options apart from protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in Central Ethiop@@ ies . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground @-@ use until the stran@@ gl@@ ehold imposed in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a vast choice of last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions continue along the border with Eritre@@ a ; a battle for this z@@ ag , controversial line called in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years have been more or less imposed , the tur@@ mo@@ il will benefit more or less . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of decre@@ asing out of himself under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , a lot of Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via social media as cheap smartphones have become more and more common and the Internet services have improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government ign@@ ores the access to Facebook and Twitter what it does in regular intervals , especially during protests , many people still have to communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that conc@@ eal from where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them that they were gathered together for protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons prosp@@ eri@@ ed the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian high countries , in politics and economy , while they are exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are living and living in flat @-@ land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray which constitute about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former vine , was up to his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly sealed in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime lacks in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister - H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n was chosen for relatively recent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region Northern Ethiop@@ ians , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st said that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , Ethiopia was killed such a tur@@ mo@@ il , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested by the government who were seemingly fu@@ eled and stolen from the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following swe@@ eps , many prot@@ agon@@ ists were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest was passed quite quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia as leaders of their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler train , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; the last month of attacked prot@@ ested in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ical city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ held shops and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests of the USA and other Western allies bring a peculi@@ ar position in a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently vo@@ iced that it has concluded that base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to clearly support democracy , he does not want his allies in an already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin mu@@ te . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded IS &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to disp@@ er@@ se the last contro@@ versy on Friday , that surrounds his campaign that his multiple repeated alleg@@ ation , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fies new questions about the communication of the presidential data of the Republi@@ cans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its co @-@ stre@@ ak , who try to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protecting the actual position , statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp made in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really didn &apos;t want to mention , President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in a timely twe@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to dimin@@ ish the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , he wanted nothing to do with the Republi@@ can presidential candidate . &quot;
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ selt to Mr. Tru@@ mp while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign for accident @-@ to @-@ face value .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already introduced sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself , when he said , the Russians should be Mrs. Clin@@ t E@@ ditions , but later he said &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then return to ruin .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even estim@@ ating sound , since its um@@ erable values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was released on Friday showed a lead with a great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative utter@@ ances , he frequently conf@@ uses his critics to distor@@ ted his statements or to understand his sense of humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he was reinforced in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ ordin@@ ates into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most famous prin@@ c@@ ists , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it Hin@@ d@@ der , completely incorrect and therefore it happened because he de@@ duc@@ ted the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most Mainstre@@ am @-@ Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton served as a Foreign Minister , ISIS allowed ISIS to spread themselves to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them to ride on any of his words and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he gro@@ an@@ ed the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; television professionals , who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can not ! . &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ordered over Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s excuse than just another evidence that he is in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
&quot; once over the price of the market once p@@ ushes , café is coming back in Green@@ point . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ itation café in Williamsburg , where you could pay only bar , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
of course the prices were p@@ ushes out of his Bedford Avenue shop@@ front .
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , released the verb in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
local people rob@@ bed it as the last loss in a gene@@ ous city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ie wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and verb now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is new . &quot;
&quot; a lively Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is also still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ term staff of the old cafes , owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he started working in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it uses even the same lamps from the old verb .
Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and cheese and there are clo@@ cks like cap@@ ill@@ age and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are Natur@@ no bow@@ ls .
&quot; the cafe serves no beer more , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ ain current of old tri@@ bal customers .
&quot; many old customers were also p@@ ushes out of Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she was pulled to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee door , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in the verb that fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea to this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addi@@ tive . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long and loyal customer since the start of the verb .
he went there before the work and ordered in@@ vari@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I moved to seven , every day , like a Swiss lady &apos;s watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
Foto Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and receive new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he has@@ n &apos;t favor@@ ed any Gro@@ ll that the soap shop has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wing coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café too . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated into the Polish cuisine and Rodri@@ guez , said that he has presented them to soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local S@@ aft@@ sman wants to fill and sell coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe is expanding to a dis@@ advant@@ aged building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a chief priest and said that he was destroyed at the ground than the café closed .
&quot; opened as the new cafe , Wh@@ itt said that the bet@@ ter@@ ies of the Lok@@ als and the no@@ bility felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ wl , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ mets had President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ ild@@ ed soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ ato sauce , potato p@@ ushes and as dessert a p@@ oth@@ pu@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with great people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added &quot; , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery histori@@ ography .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they show culinary solidarity , when they met with a re@@ por@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , straightforward I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in the store since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ äs@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ushes and vegetable stock . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ por@@ ter h@@ ackers ordered , this found the pair of discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , Leb@@ anese and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were made of an ingredient and a slightly tri@@ lig@@ ament which stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many continents that they serve as dinner .
co@@ cks sm@@ ir@@ ks .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like blo@@ ws , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
cre@@ ws of women co@@ atings for male rock work and it was served fresh baked past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who are star@@ ving during the first World War in hungry Europeans . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; stands out the ways with which the country went on , no longer the shr@@ ink of the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense issue , &quot; gif@@ ted Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; equally tense was the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ fication : mysterious meals such as Br@@ ote and Kas@@ ser@@ ollen were found to stap@@ le food , the Kas@@ ser@@ olle , as a &quot; wonderful kind , food @-@ remains , because chefs hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients among a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry heat .
&quot; meat , which was for years the center of the American cuisine , became an extremely rare luxury . &quot;
peculi@@ ar compounds have been tried out as a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ish gr@@ ati@@ fication will prevail over taste or even healthy kitchen .
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepared Zi@@ egel@@ man a court of this time , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man continues to work out : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ground butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ recipes .
&quot; as never before , or since then , budget@@ ary economical - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country is such . &quot;
&quot; following the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to be budget@@ ary officials and the challenge , pamp@@ er like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square View &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ d@@ bits . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Essen @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly proclaimed the simple Io@@ wa farmer &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , as well as the milli@@ on@@ ess man of the world , to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ ist continental cuisine as fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a fast g@@ ild@@ ed room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was really realistic .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have been committed at the same mistake , if not his wife was Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ ure him with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ it of a household with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the boring food in Washington but also one of the most tear @-@ off preparations . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food products . &quot;
the pair gave me better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ law in law - for example the food could not throw away .
&quot; she had a real fear of wast@@ ed food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ exploitation .
&quot; after the dish were vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert that had prepared them at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ men@@ sage , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , humble recipes give a chic name to miss . &quot;
&quot; there was no left cream , only pl@@ ums , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
everyone de@@ pressed a bit rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown extre@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly enough it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e won three times a post envel@@ ope .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
at bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he put his own life at the game by helping others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ed anything to save others the lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself has died on a bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group , which saved the lives according to the picture newspaper up to barely 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers turn their own lives to play , to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid to the war . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour saving of a cleansing from the ruins of a house , went in 2014 around the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; but as heroes he has never seen himself , &quot; &quot; according to image : &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save life , I think that God sees me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar itself became an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b attack in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have rejected four fac@@ bom@@ bs over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b , so that not children can play with them , &quot; c@@ ited the image his last words before he died . &quot;
the fatal bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Grön@@ land : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ tier is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , they usually come to the surface only in the winter . &quot;
this H@@ ai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good one 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land @-@ ha@@ ie will only get more than 150 years old .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k along the ground of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it depends on , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates 2,@@ 6 km / h - and this maximum speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
this one @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of Greenland , the 3@@ 92 years of age . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ ar@@ l@@ ein from Max @-@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span , which means for ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; though , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist had long been that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie became a stone . &quot;
only faul@@ ted the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to watch , eventually they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea from the thin co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they dive at the surface mostly in winter . &quot;
&quot; over the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know accordingly little . &quot;
&quot; your time @-@ st@@ emp@@ o moder@@ ation they , when they used six animals with one transmitter for six animals . &quot;
&quot; loot make this ha@@ ie nevertheless : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had the pin@@ ew@@ est of a young ice @-@ bears . &quot;
possibly they are hunting asleep animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice and are looking for car@@ c@@ asses who are from higher water layers to the bottom .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues were examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as a head @-@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long while the biggest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , analy@@ zes them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ et is already created before the birth of shar@@ ks , which in the proteins included in it will be no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lenses .
&quot; as a result , your birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s than nuclear @-@ weapon tests , in the atmosphere of this radio@@ active carbon . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 cen@@ timeters the length of third creature contained the lens , against a low over@@ cast of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon @-@ weapon , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 levels in their lenses , which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ res long Greenland is an old age of 335 years , during the record @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters even 3@@ 92 years old may be . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females only then got after@@ ward , when they are longer than four meters , was well known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timeters were probably at the threshold of the sexually mature , and his age was destined for 156 years , Grön@@ land @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously have at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
&quot; also , this is likely to be the world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot;
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in cold waters is not acci@@ dental .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland @-@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on the neck woke up a 120 year old har@@ po@@ kes , was captured before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on spar@@ sely . &quot;
so you mature later - and age slow .
&quot; in order to keep yourself warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume increases much faster than its surface , by which the animal gives heat control . &quot;
&quot; the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram &quot; &quot; Eleph@@ ant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on making as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ iller . &quot;
a very big animal should also invest in a long life on the other hand .
background at a double @-@ pack
with topics around B@@ auen the community at the most recent meeting will be focused seriously .
&quot; with relief , the panel took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz on that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the younger out@@ put@@ ties can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the real estate , par@@ cel@@ ing and draft questions clari@@ fied and the applications were made available to dimension , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( range 1 ) to those interested parties nothing more in the way . &quot;
the community at is convinced that the bro@@ oks bro@@ oks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and thou@@ ghtful seniors alike .
&quot; as it was called , builders now can report immediately in the city hall , about the addition of the plots , the Municip@@ al Council is expected to advise in its September @-@ session . &quot;
&quot; to also en@@ su@@ ing requests for the relocation of further commercial enterprises , associated with the creation of jobs , to be decided , loss of the council , which was newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of Lower @-@ lar@@ n , there is already in the area of the country @-@ area around two par@@ c@@ els towards state 2112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the City of the Main Town is in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities for moving from London to move jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt most benef@@ ited from Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of Excellence fel@@ ds financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money la@@ es must continue to operate from London from finance in the entire EU . &quot;
&quot; until now , for the so @-@ called EU pass , the approval of the UK has so far enough for them to be approved in Britain . &quot;
this is exactly big US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ Association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; counts with 10000 new jobs at the Main Event 5 years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the biggest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities such as European insurance super@@ visor EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the bank database is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg gets a huge fund business in Luxembourg , but also in the case of Dublin as well as Dublin as Dublin as Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt be much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .

&quot; Clin@@ tons deserve 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % federal control &quot;
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton announced their tax declaration on Friday for 2015 , which revealed a income from USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ t USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president of Bill Clinton gave an income of USD 3 million by the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on their office in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t Candi@@ date for the European Council , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax exemp@@ tions of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid a effective state @-@ tax of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clin@@ t campaign hel@@ per in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ass contradiction , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind wrong exc@@ uses and trac@@ ts with regard to his previous promises to publish its tax exemp@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax exemp@@ tions , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New Yorker &apos;s busin@@ es@@ sman , and his lawyers have stated as the reason for its denial to control the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ t election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax insp@@ ections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things , also the Republi@@ can Pres@@ ent Comm@@ at of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney have already missed that his ref@@ us@@ al issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton announced already on the subject , and on Friday released a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ level Republi@@ cans Tru@@ mp call for his tax return . &quot;
on Thursday she said the subject of a speech on the economy of Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do what every other presidential did@@ acy has done in recent decades and to release his tax exemp@@ tions . &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ tico reported that Tru@@ mp has paid any or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist at New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax hav@@ ens and tax consultants , the indications that still might be the case . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; federal control have become a subject in the election campaign . &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ets which would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal too .
&quot; during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ op@@ glomer@@ ate here has its seat to exchange Tru@@ mp to a meeting on their tax exemp@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; buff@@ ett said he was subjected to the IR@@ S as well as a tax examination of the IR@@ S and tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton &apos;s campaign launched tax return to the year 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average of an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax approach of about 40.@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the annual declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of its income is referred to as wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main event was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 tax@@ ed . &quot;

Jewish director crus@@ hed Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ selection has been removed after &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ paved a media watch , after he had betra@@ yed that Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ occupation , since it would have been a Arab guest according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger in Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay Lanz@@ mann has tried to find Israel on the country @-@ choice list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a way to choose Israel about its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel proved that the measure is an &quot; inten@@ tional decision by Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason that was behind it , delet@@ es in the director even more hum@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the submitted by Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli Ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Department , called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were ent@@ angl@@ ed by this event and troubled .
this is really very embarrassing .
&quot; the fact that this has been carried out in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater shame . &quot;
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the Am@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; the incident , a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , in which people knew the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would be the alleged &quot; &quot; Arabian demands &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ash@@ amed of you , &quot; says it in another post , in which it was noted that the hotel is located at the most beautiful Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident , &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct instruction , &quot; Israel not to enter into the quick op@@ tionally , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
add that the country @-@ selection has now been added .

&quot; students had joined Sao Paulo on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police set Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber @-@ fin against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers , trying to tackle the students , which led to the police of rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about their plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , somewhat less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions grew according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the Trade Agreement between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an , around 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in stores in the country , distributed the Ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies have existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further trade mark is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade set between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and bet@@ ru@@ ed $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade mark was achieved by deliveries of machines , vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is a record of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
&quot; last year the Russian deployment of around 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , primarily of travel vis@@ as , of Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which affects the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; you could say that the rec@@ ord@@ ant tourists could be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the Ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d who have received Monum@@ ents of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gateway of Mer@@ cy
the minist@@ ries from the past@@ oral unit Ey@@ acht@@ al Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages have been done .
&quot; in order to survive the period up to the next novel@@ s of all minist@@ ries in a period of two years , the Upper @-@ minist@@ erial round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations has been tested and finally decided finally for the bish@@ op@@ ric town of Freiburg , where this year was held on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the end of Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ cy on the Frei@@ burger Münster , a special pilgrimage destination . &quot;

&quot; from Hor@@ b there was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster is one of the loved ones , and thus the pilgrimage way from Münster was taken . &quot;
&quot; the daily tours have been guided in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is at Feld@@ kreu@@ zen , Kap@@ ellen or churches will always be re@@ ast to sing a song from a separate pilgri@@ m song . &quot;

sh@@ rot Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ing at home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ us role , which had made his land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the j@@ aw and made the legend pro@@ ud@@ ly , when he rus@@ hed at home to take a victory from the favour@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals . &quot;
&quot; she reiter@@ ated the trick , after they took place in March by train @-@ World Championships in London , despite the return show , Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this time as a execution .
&quot; Ho@@ ys retirement generated a gap , the ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close . &quot;
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y @-@ used - and Sk@@ inner carried out a Olympi@@ ast@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand @-@ dr@@ ags set the New Zealand in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; according to his round there was just below , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy of strategy made a great part of the transformation , when exec@@ uting a higher gear in order to slow down him , and to allow it to keep Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert and fell from Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when this was on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name .
&quot; in the final hand , we have placed an Olympi@@ ast@@ ord and the World Champion was defeated . &quot;
it was simply incredible .
there is no better way to win .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there were indications that he fell on the road after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Riv@@ als .
this time there was no such problem for this time .
&quot; saying , &quot; It feels with all the GB fl@@ ags on the Tri@@ bun@@ es as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have so poorly managed with so many world titles so bad , that it was incredible to get back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London were won . &quot;
if the bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months is that we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the area of Pos@@ sible that he has repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( one apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a collection of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the che@@ eses of the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Spr@@ int that begins today and will pass over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year old of Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medalli@@ sts of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified off with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four mil@@ eage races . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which was won in London Gold at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition in which Wig@@ gins will be in the focus . &quot;
&quot; he had suffered yesterday in front of the qualification before the qualification before he called , to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition that will continue tomorrow and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a ch@@ ar to medals .
after a truly exceptional depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was run@@ down .
&quot; it also played dram@@ as in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical Leit@@ ers Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April is in the midst of Sex@@ ism and har@@ ass@@ ment , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like it could be a legendary reputation GB@@ s that has reached a perfect moment to be repeated again . &quot;
the future of the mel@@ tion of Portland due to the lifting of the energy supply is question@@ able .
&quot; the future of aluminum extr@@ usion from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - standing on the game , as the system operator will announce the energy supply contract and thus lift all delivery contracts , as the provided energy company delivered . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the Government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
for 20 years the payout ass@@ uring runs in November .
up to 2000 stations in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations are direct and indirect - could be at risk during a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ os effects since the mel@@ tion consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa burned the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ a , which led last year to a closing of the angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the weekly basis for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which served the large aluminium @-@ aluminium allo@@ y with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three more owners announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese companies CIT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant in Portland continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ tion , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to be said that the &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; &quot; were supposed to have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts do have a 12 month period of termin@@ ation period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; from therefore , AG@@ L goes out that the contracts in the financial year will contribute to revenues in the financial year , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;

&quot; AG@@ L shared with that there is already the value of the contracts entered into the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; expectation of an termin@@ ation &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; analy@@ st , on the basis of the poor economic relations in the industry before the possible closure of Portland melt fil@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near Newcastle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland has invested around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; if both plants of the market disappear , that would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;

&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the sep@@ t@@ ings of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; flag of all J@@ den@@ omin@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ omin@@ ator C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the Cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; kend@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced the latest news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people that I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre format ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem of Rob and Ca@@ it@@ lyn , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ shop@@ s.@@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of their sister and ends with a classic check@@ out : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ an action of almost every birthday sep@@ sis of a children &apos;s dispatch ( Se@@ ac@@ rest led the sentence , &quot; You believed that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take their other girls to participate in this public@@ city . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the vo@@ gue , there is certainly a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim may seem to have be@@ aten the Vo@@ gue Cover , be@@ aten ( her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the sep@@ t@@ lement of the magazine is a League for itself . &quot;
the sep@@ t@@ apes for Vo@@ gue is most of the most popular edition of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles more of a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the unvei@@ ling of its Cover@@ stars is so predic@@ table that in the last two years pictures of the journal is still se@@ per@@ ated in front of the official announ@@ cements .
&quot; women who were already on the cover were , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in the last years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the modelling &quot; &quot; Models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ er and Di@@ or brand@@ ed Jennifer Lawrence was the honor of the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs J@@ omin@@ ator - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break @-@ model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous individuals or Reality stars or young people today who know how to set a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to den@@ omin@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el themselves in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of their career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ant &apos;s success does not like every one . &quot;
with their Reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s status in the fashion world was always something tense .
in June cri@@ tici@@ zed Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ omin@@ ator and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the Mist@@ pieces of the moment .
these feelings recovered back high when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the failure to go out seems to be at the point .
kend@@ all J@@ omin@@ ator is on the cover of the sep@@ t@@ lement of Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you images from themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold from her painted pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in their leisure time she is seen in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
common centers of 16@@ 0.000 people each year
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the relief of the country is rejected annually by the municipal centres , while the trade shows the impact of further mid @-@ term transactions in already over@@ bur@@ dened transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , auxili@@ ary workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and those who have no means for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already excessive , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , this legal centers are expected to lose further 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Municip@@ al centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last collection of the National Association of Municip@@ al centres yiel@@ ded , that already thousands of people are rejected each year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without a abolition of the federal government would only become worse .
&quot; Queens@@ lands Municip@@ al centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ ett@@ able and dro@@ op@@ pres@@ sive debt , families who have been released by parti@@ tions - all these people have problems legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will be forced by June 2017 the means by 30 percent , which means thousands of helpful people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General Minister of Gener@@ ators and Federal Foreign Affairs as well as Sen@@ ators from Queensland George Bran@@ dis to re@@ plen@@ ish this mid @-@ term , so people can get the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government filled its commitment to up@@ lift the funds for righ@@ ties on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customer communities , as well as that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign charged after employees supposedly moved weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was indic@@ ted because of alleged in@@ action , having been informed that their campaign leader for North Carolina in February had established a s@@ ut@@ shell for an employee while they were traveling in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in a indic@@ t@@ ment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the Prince Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program@@ er for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini gave to , monthly , that the matter would be regulated internally before it re@@ alizes that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a pist@@ ol , put his right foref@@ inger on the de@@ duction , and r@@ amm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; there were Bord@@ ini in his charges . &quot;
&quot; once he attended the local and regional campaign guide , Bord@@ ini notes that already at least four more people had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave in the indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired up to damage damage , &quot; there were Bord@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; the indic@@ t@@ ment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , referred to a mo@@ il in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ w@@ anese owners and weapons should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was clear that the media would have led his words from the context , and that he would not be offensive to violence . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint requires damages from the campaign to breach the duty of duty , and of Philip due to bodily injury and break@@ down damage . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ ch@@ erin Hope H@@ icks was not reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip also fails .
&quot; WC@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , announces that Philli@@ p is no longer employees of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; on calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
this took representative surveys of the opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government action in the north is almost ruled on , this is not possible after the re@@ frag@@ ment in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the most powerful party , and thus would have good chances to continue the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD rus@@ hed by 35,@@ 6 percent in five years ago at 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to survey , the party is just under the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the African .
&quot; the Left rose by 19 percent ( before 18,@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previous 8,@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ iner &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; in each case , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s land . &quot;
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD of the survey was estimated that only 23 percent ( choice 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
Af@@ ak would represent 14 percent for the first time in the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ate would be missed in contrast to 2011 in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and internet in Zeit@@ l@@ upe : recently launched the Nokia Communic@@ ator on the market .
&quot; today , the successor domin@@ ate today the world - his maker was experienced a disaster . &quot;
the device weigh@@ ed almost a half kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger ; it was therefore not good in the hand .
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in store was at the beginning of eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would reach today for about two sel@@ ections with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone will now be delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros you can buy the devices on the Internet , but they originate somehow from the Stone Age of the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product for a few months before at the C@@ eb@@ it office in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ phal@@ ia format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to websites was possible via HTML @-@ browser , as well as ag@@ oni@@ zing slow . &quot;
a paper@@ back was available to a digi@@ ti@@ book book and an electronic calendar .
&quot; there was a small ant@@ enna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop . &quot;
then they found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; very proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody could susp@@ ect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the cell @-@ card of the Finn@@ s experienced a unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled in . &quot;
&quot; today , the market today domin@@ ates suppliers that came all a lot later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold approximately 1,4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple are alone 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
&quot; worldwide sales with the equipment is about 400 billion euros . &quot;
these are the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone in the meantime a whole industry has been established .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only in early 2007 , then Apple @-@ chief Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet @-@ communication , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , nor today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had seen . &quot;
&quot; they disappeared after all , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
we now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; in inc@@ ision , every Germans now look at his cell phone for 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn how to put your smartphone off , &quot; said exactly Jan@@ ina &apos;s ball , in the Siemens @-@ Management Board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring home in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renovation and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we managed to make a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and they will reach again by providing new possibilities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we will be able to create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London , it will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
&quot; I told me that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ fl@@ er had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to the dis@@ appearance , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question . &quot;
how the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; extension is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to swe@@ ating growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in the whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion te@@ ures infrastructure investments in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a consequence of the world &apos;s best airport officers , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented run of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 4@@ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London &apos;s London games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will likewise be one .
it is time that we ste@@ er this oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and raise He@@ ath@@ row as well as supporting our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; &quot; on display block &quot;
&quot; for companies that make money with Onlin@@ e@@ wer@@ bung money come according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle ad block@@ ers , an &quot; &quot; @-@ and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad lock@@ ings on his desktop side , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger where users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ s would change the en@@ coding on his advertisements in order to detect the indication of what part of the page advertising is to ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate . &quot;
but ad@@ ad proclaimed that there has found a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ gger , the speaker wrote at Ad@@ block Ben Williams that &quot; &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the tense open source community and the res@@ ists have already been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left the fight for social media , is a strong indi@@ z for how best indicator can be applied for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people , it is almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with my least billions of active users who access Facebook via its mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 percent of the value proceeds fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers did not have an effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , distributed a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that there would be &quot; ad pre@@ dat@@ ent@@ ool &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook maintained that Ad@@ block would be worrying because they would also block content on the page , which are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to get more control over the hands of the people . &quot;
women in suspected su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police calls witnesses , after spending a woman in the early hours of the morning at a suspected su@@ ic@@ ide by several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud short after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed himself in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a silence at the age of 49 years , which was driven by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , had to kill themselves . &quot;
it died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not been identified yet , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident occurring . &quot;
&quot; it became an investigation @-@ making process , which is a &quot; log@@ istical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be held accountable .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the mot@@ orists not have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was in the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year a polic@@ eman of the driving kill@@ ings acqu@@ itted after having passed a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year old victim had drunk , and has become unconscious on the road , and took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court proved that the polic@@ eman had responded to a call -- to a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation &quot; , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should register in police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate amo@@ del : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate .
&quot; scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms , similar to those of climate research . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have infl@@ ated with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once detected . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow transformation of Venus could be explained by their tight atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , dro@@ pping @-@ like atmosphere and still have slowly moved on@@ ward . &quot;
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accom@@ o@@ date life and be faster with dar@@ ker . &quot;
the early Venus prof@@ ited from a Sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS Modell@@ simulation exp@@ el the slow re@@ con@@ ium of Venus its ti@@ lt , the sun almost two months long , &quot; declared G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this warm@@ ed the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which looks like a shelves to get the surface off a large proportion of the sun heat . &quot;
&quot; the result are average @-@ temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than that of the earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought forth a story of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution , which was previously thought by Plan@@ etary researchers . &quot;
&quot; although it was once inhabited , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light was exposed . &quot;
its oceans was dar@@ ed and their water v@@ ap@@ or was burned away from the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ power , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate modelling in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy performs as a coach of description
&quot; Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado , and led to a low co @-@ determination right on the decision @-@ making process of the team . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and mer@@ ges that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;

&quot; in the course of summer long and much more thought , how I could improve this team to give him more depth , so it requires and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organization &apos;s organisation . &quot;
he also has to have a co @-@ determination in decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had been consul@@ ted by Roy on 23 May 2013 , thanks to his contributions for the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded as the winner of Jack Adam@@ s awards during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 and the best coach of the League .

&quot; strikes against the oil field @-@ provider Wood Group , spor@@ adi@@ cally operated on platforms in the North Sea , carried out by Royal Dutch Shell by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and r@@ alli@@ ed trade unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the ent@@ angl@@ ing process of the current streets , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold some all @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , start to start the next year to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage subsidies from up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Wood Group has shortened to its contrast to its contrast in the North Sea by around 9 percent , due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the no@@ cul@@ ation of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage drop for On@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since it is its business activities as a result of his meg@@ az@@ collaboration with the British Energy companies BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are based on the lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that must be strengthened by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament member Dave Ander@@ son met at the beginning of this week with workers &apos; leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest working disputes , who have been in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy , which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion spending money will be expected in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the Pl@@ agues of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
&quot; the newest mission with the Ke@@ pler &apos;s space @-@ tel@@ escope has helped the astronom@@ ical catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star of Pl@@ ei@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars are rotating in the constell@@ ation to different formats , as well as in what context the rotation periods are standing with the planning stage . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ ad@@ ena &apos;s infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ fish of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star @-@ buy , which emerged about 125 million years ago , reaching the adult old now . &quot;
you are now turning the fastest .
at peak red rates these str@@ aps stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches .
&quot; since these angles travel through the mag@@ net fields of stars , they have a br@@ aking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is altern@@ ate , its rotation starts to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the red rate of every star by exam@@ ining the time between the appearance of an recognizable constell@@ ation -- as sun@@ spots -- recognizes .
the newest catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates pointed out that massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ els compar@@ es the stars with dancers ; with larger stars slower Pi@@ rou@@ es turn as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow Rot@@ ors tend to be mass@@ aging , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star@@ ters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades so close is , it serves as an ideal cos@@ mic laboratory to compare the qualities as red @-@ rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ fish of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , When , and why to slow their rotation rates , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Rot@@ ation rates of Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star coming from
the tears slept faster at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. Bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days of Base to base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 years old pro on the 12th of August against the Tampa Bay R@@ ays will carry a last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to both the 14 @-@ time game @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a tenth year deal with him since 2007 a year 27 million US dollars .
&quot; until the end of the contrast , on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - in full sal@@ ary . &quot;
as a player paid it Rodri@@ guez for a long time .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two other Bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be absorbed by the 41 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; - on the field , so controversial is its appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 the super@@ star was introduced at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 steri@@ li@@ zed stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked down on a thesis in the so called V@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 for 211 games . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main suspic@@ ious of years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in Süd @-@ Florida increasing funding .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced on 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , for I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot;
also his fare@@ well @-@ days do not go straight .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball @-@ legends in their last games get even the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a fare@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; ätz@@ te Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; anyway Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson announced , sympathy of fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ ri@@ v@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; s@@ angen the pend@@ ant at 4 : 9 @-@ defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ing@@ es &quot;
caught : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ tasting the wei@@ ght@@ fall of Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a caught ath@@ l@@ ete would have gained almost a medal .
&quot; in front of the seventh race , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight of Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been tested positively and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the case of already critical athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come about . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en has been proven to be the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ quer@@ ade means for dop@@ ing . &quot;
the International Sport Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the finals over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze medal . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the footh@@ ills of 50 m Frei@@ sing style .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of B @-@ trial at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Tribunal &apos;s CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio oo@@ zes the news on the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old thus went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it should act in the dec@@ ayed substance of the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w will immediately be able to agree with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said , &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , approximately all weights from the chronic dop@@ ing@@ ual nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympi@@ ad champion in the class until 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive on the ster@@ oid ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both openly deny the intake , both may not start in the class until 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; in front of the start of Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team except for systematic D@@ op@@ ings the start of systematic D@@ op@@ ings , also the L@@ äu@@ er Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the swimming pool , the earlier trans@@ gres@@ sions were also ensured between athletes also between athletes . &quot;
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t took the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Frei@@ sing , I will commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said to the French radio . &quot;
sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested in 2014 with the Chinese champi@@ on@@ ships had been positive on the stim@@ ulator tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had only to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ ast@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmers of ext@@ or@@ tion mal@@ ware is currently based on targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of Mal@@ ware , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes from 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies were surv@@ ey@@ ed at least once , partly several times victims of a attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
40 percent of the victims paid by the perpet@@ rators demanded by the perpet@@ rators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators specialised in their presses software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks on attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to er@@ pres@@ sive ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re monitoring a start@@ ling rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; explained Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising material .
&quot; then , the perpet@@ rators discovered em@@ be@@ ating software for itself . &quot;
&quot; only private , he was the target , but the change to company att@@ acking took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ se@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an op@@ pressor , it seeks targeted after in@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encrypted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the press .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files must be the victims money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ day@@ time Bit@@ coin .
&quot; but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , it is about companies around sensitive customers or project databases without which the production still stands . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the operation completely in a case , in a case people were in danger . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of self @-@ acts . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : do not pay , you only promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators of st@@ agnation in the operation . &quot;
the h@@ acker again know this and try everything to set up a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researcher of F @-@ secure the user surfaces and contact with the presses are investigated and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually attemp@@ ting to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrific@@ es by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , direct free support websites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and are individuals who sol@@ ves after payments of a few hundreds of Euro , companies have to negotiate on hard and five @-@ digit amounts to get back their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware ext@@ or@@ tion , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains security exper@@ tly Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from Anti@@ virus supplier Sophos : &quot; a single person may write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building to the actual bi@@ kers .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits created by the mal@@ ware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is a adap@@ tive tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the black@@ out are then looking for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the newly built software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log@@ ically in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a crime and asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ fic@@ ated machine .
&quot; usually super@@ vis@@ ing the crimin@@ als then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies @-@ IT responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey will trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey to be able to retri@@ eve the Ran@@ som@@ ware via file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful earnings , the perpet@@ rators are instead of publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing . &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage is higher than before the type of data is higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could create completely new goals in the internet of things on the internet . &quot;
on the h@@ ackers Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researcher like it could get a thermo@@ stat under its control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a non @-@ block@@ ed heating thus could be quite a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the perpet@@ r@@ ator then instead of the heating in the future will block a whole manufacturing road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a subject in industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and versatile
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sound fairly over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was constructed , in everyday life proves to be extremely flexible . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have much space in the front row as well as in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior space are well finished and act pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ Ober@@ side falls off something . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is HR @-@ V in storage room .
&quot; there is not only a trunk @-@ room of 45@@ 3 l for high @-@ issued and 10@@ 26 l around the back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the sitting areas of the return can be like Kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is height from the floor up to a blank@@ ets 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk room is well loaded , however , the charge height with 650 mm is somewhat higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l Diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large rotating areas very powerful .
&quot; however , he might judge his work somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; we are happy about the day @-@ day consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is one more mot@@ orization : one 1.5 @-@ l gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a total drive is not offered .
driving is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
&quot; however , the steering is likely to be a little more direct . &quot;
the equipment is available in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes un@@ fulfilled .
&quot; security systems is one of the City Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assist@@ ent ( working until temp@@ o 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the Sp@@ ur@@ hal@@ dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ts sometimes irrit@@ ated , because he has been rated as many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ed objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works the remote assistant .
and the intelligent tempor@@ al respon@@ ds respon@@ ds to the road detection and d@@ ros@@ selt as required at the rate .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under arm@@ rest and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euros for the well @-@ equipped top Diesel is fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , receives the gas@@ oline starting from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ gas norm .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and consistent car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall in flight @-@ bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; for a liability is conceivable only with haz@@ ards that are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed the Ober@@ land@@ es@@ Tribunal Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the r@@ ack@@ et was broken with the fall of a knee br@@ ink .
&quot; however , the accident could happen everywhere - it hand around a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay the man no compensation .
disease fall : when paid the organizer
&quot; they will only get money back after their trip , if the cause of the disease is des@@ per@@ ately free in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; this , however , is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the twi@@ sted case , a family was hard on the second day of their Tur@@ qu@@ ur@@ lau@@ bs , difficult to diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost all the holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective pl@@ aster that was alleged to be poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
&quot; the family was the view , the trip was insufficient - and said against the organis@@ er . &quot;
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ters had no success .
although the law@@ suit was indeed faul@@ ty .
&quot; however , the Organiz@@ er started just before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ant of it . &quot;
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was in order .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of water no cont@@ amin@@ ants were found .
&quot; the condition of several hotel guests - perhaps by connecting among each other , among each other - belonged to the general risk of life . &quot;
from 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 erk@@ ran@@ kt .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state m@@ ts and determined to react at the same time on terror .
sure : our country will not answer the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
this triumph we will not treat the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , but the security and strength is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ a aims to implement a implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personalised rein@@ forcement of the security forces , and indeed &quot; in medium @-@ four sizes , over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism is again under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , it will be done so novel@@ ty that mainly the acquisition of weapons in the internet is being sc@@ aled . &quot;
the last much discussed Schwei@@ ge@@ vity for doctors should be maintained after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the Doc@@ tr@@ ance of solutions , as the haz@@ ard of citizens could be decreased , he said with a view about psych@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; to counter the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support for it . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
&quot; for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans to cover the deployment . &quot;
&quot; SPD Chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot;
it is important that the Interior have spoken clearly against action .
&quot; this was a ear@@ shot for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke ME@@ DI@@ ENG@@ RU@@ P@@ PE ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ ens@@ ère had rejected a ban out of the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double nationality .
a general pro@@ hibition of full v@@ om@@ ar@@ ation he can be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; you cannot do everything what you do , and I reject the tr@@ ages of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses before judgment .
&quot; green @-@ chief in Simone Peter cast the Minister , he would like to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror pact and action . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ Part@@ el@@ ef Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Sp@@ ru@@ che and a tigh@@ tening of the right @-@ right people bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better traffic dra@@ in on the motorway exit
it is regularly on the slope - here &apos;s a picture from November .
&quot; however , that is to change : the legal obligation should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the car drivers who are standing in St@@ au on the ambient way each evening in St@@ au , if they travel across the motorway , Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the country road building is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 . August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and exit Wes@@ el Street , the right @-@ right track at 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then easily cast straight from the hammer on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic shares early on , whereby the total public process will be improved on the versatile section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U group in the district of the representation of Münster @-@ West .
the driving trail on the fe@@ eder is annoying the drivers especially between 17 and 19 hours .
&quot; week@@ days ranges from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping road , and sometimes beyond . &quot;
&quot; reason is the needle @-@ cave on the B 51 just before departure Wes@@ eler street . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic will only be classified across the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be re@@ constructed a three @-@ three years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge has no longer the necessary capacity to absor@@ b mainly the heavy @-@ duty traffic .
&quot; how long this Eng@@ pass and the associated decision will last , the relevant state can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to count : because the bridge has an official rest period up to the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the right @-@ care decision , the country is aware of the busi@@ est times into the school holidays , because with disabilities to reck@@ on . &quot;
the traffic will be guided on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are planning a musical project now .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a concept of award @-@ winning pieces &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
in the context of the club N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging in the little house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background to visit schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and bro@@ oks little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scene of images and video animations made it possible to follow the action of action , so the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spr@@ ak@@ el , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without fluid and migration background between 14 and 20 years are able to visit professionally , professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , drama and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal language investigation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .

rain instead of star@@ ters : hope for weather @-@ repair
the weather has made the ast@@ ro@@ b Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at night to Friday a stop by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain had been bad for the heavenly spectacle , the president of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many star@@ ters in the sky . &quot;

relaxing night : tips for sleeping troubles
&quot; in the evenings you sit around forever , at night you can &apos;t remember overnight , in the morning there is already far ahead of wak@@ ing up anymore . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult inter@@ rup@@ tions and more than ten percent feel often or permanently relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep ?
&quot; there are several forms of sle@@ epers , and there can be many forms of sleep , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , Managing Director of the German Society for Schlaf@@ Research and Schlaf@@ Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand is understood , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a input and a sle@@ ek . &quot;
&quot; right now , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Managing Director at the German House physician with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep @-@ disorders ?
the causes of sleep are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psych@@ ical or mal@@ adjusted factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
it is not rare is the inter@@ rup@@ ting expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early wak@@ ing is frequently used in depression often , &quot; &quot; says We@@ ved . &quot;
and it may be that different factors are bed@@ ding each other .
&quot; who for example has a band@@ name , can be bad , awak@@ ens every two to three hours and then begin to greet about everyday problems and -@@ care , there is a example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
from when should we handle sleep @-@ disorders ?
&quot; who has not sleeps over a period of a month at least three nights per week , and the day is imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor , betra@@ y@@ eth We@@ er@@ . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look quite differently : it is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ fold , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve it , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ oral changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medication - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets , only in the case of an emergency and at the most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; sleeping alco@@ hol@@ s are in Germany hardly , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary part of the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedi@@ zin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you should first contact the medical doctor at sleeping . &quot;
&quot; it can be clear with exam@@ inations , whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
&quot; who should go into the dormit@@ ory , and what is happening there ? &quot;
&quot; for exam@@ ining in the dormit@@ ory rates of medicine for example in snor@@ ing with breath@@ s , in comparison to sleep de@@ dness , or if you do not find the cause of a sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess does not find Fi@@ etze . &quot;
it is actually not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch @-@ sheep , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after sales you go to bed with his normal time .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one contributes a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a f@@ enn@@ ae in the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera stands out at the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected the problems get in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of vac@@ an@@ ets where you can stop for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ aker counts on : regular bed@@ time and up@@ set times , not too long in bed , do not sleep too long in bed , not distant to sleep , alcohol , and not at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German swimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself via Facebook to dis@@ closing the D@@ SV @-@ team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had caught gold in Doha for the first time in Doha , and presented at the same time his first world record . &quot;
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook protective against his in the criticism of the ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; in a country , in which an Olympi@@ asi@@ eger gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle . 150,000 € should not be aston@@ ished about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand very well . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries which are much more encouraging and in the subject of dop@@ ing not as accurate or run it even . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that the controls should be adjusted , &quot; he commented on . &quot;
he wanted to launch a com@@ eback would have to be reported Dei@@ bler already nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is how you should also keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled at a certain time before World Cup / OS by independent insp@@ ections of the W@@ ada / fin@@ a must not take part , &quot; calls for the choice of Hamburger , who has now run an ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of baggage is captured
professional Di@@ ebe at the Düsseldorf Airport
civilian fin@@ s of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police took the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed as Ban@@ de several ash@@ ing- and bag @-@ ste@@ els .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 clock , civil officials met in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf , a ban@@ de again that was known to the polic@@ emen of the last theft of theft . &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several deliber@@ ated since the middle of July this year and were collaborative , working @-@ up and very professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists in cid @-@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can announce the thi@@ eves , the independent to the Com@@ mit of criminal off@@ ences after Germany were passed , four deeds . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of more than 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ om@@ amy , in the meantime , still a rest of the sc@@ ales : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ fried@@ sha@@ sha@@ in does not affect the first glance , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; when one goes along the road from the east to the west , one comes from playing grounds , a fresh@@ ly painted kinder@@ garten and a beer ads . &quot;
on the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; bo@@ ast .
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , who will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rent apartments . &quot;
&quot; article on these &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; as the responsible real estate company peac@@ em@@ sha@@ in calls , will be preferred during the last weeks of burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the house is with number 94 : once it was occupied by now , the inhabitants of lease , on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , H@@ enkel has spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been vac@@ ated with 300 police officers and three teams on site , lock parts of the street and held visitors of it , leaving the house with number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile construction workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Board of Directors decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later moved the police and builders under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street works peaceful : parents go walking with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and children &apos;s char@@ ds .
&quot; left force is not the main objective of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 and Jana * , which attracts three children here , especially from the police presence of gener@@ ously . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the household projects they share the concern of rising rental and cent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a neighbourhood that would like to have a majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ous left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin In@@ sen@@ ator and the police arise between the household and their neighbours , so obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; peaceful settlements in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which today is a low average daily , compared to the rest of the city , and has high poverty sr@@ isi@@ ko . &quot;
&quot; also home@@ work and the resulting home projects belong to a long time : 1990 numerous houses have been occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under a down@@ right street , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the city has become increasingly becoming a mag@@ net for tourists and elec@@ tive affin@@ ity from all over the world : with them now they share the inhabitants from the GDR @-@ times and former house@@ keeping in its neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the Mi@@ eten , which have risen by nearly 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the re@@ constructions in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them to the wor@@ ded dis@@ cs or fresh@@ ly painted fac@@ ades , which have been rejected with color @-@ exploitation . &quot;
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ hand autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours might see that as problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes of bodily injury , according to crimes , according to polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the majority of criminal off@@ ences does not make any damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 lives , there may be no talk about uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; regarding violence , it is spar@@ ating : the people in the 94 are their neighbours that certainly did not have been . &quot;
also the famous burning cars give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a crime , on the contrary , &quot; here you help each other , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is conscious of the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße and stayed there .
&quot; it was so important that her people get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claim the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : through the quar@@ rel@@ ess re@@ constructions of the former buildings , the old inhabitants sw@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; these are all con@@ domini@@ um apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well stun@@ ned , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I cannot be absolutely non @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if there is never anyone listening ? &quot;
&quot; there is frustration to all sides of frustration , even in the police and the residents . &quot;
&quot; for en@@ drawn , who har@@ dened themselves about color bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the household projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; who her@@ ls , should be aware of it - just like anyone who moves to a pub , there is bad about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons named above have asked for this reason , not to be called by their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , it is the social worker @-@ worker . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee centres for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it looks as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , labour and refugee assistant , administration , authorities , and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customers from the labour circle indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le now is , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which has mainly a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less mo@@ ck@@ ingly had to be focused on the variety of areas of tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; searched for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the area of social work , even an icy wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization to work with local people and also behind the scenes and ma@@ ins . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent focus on three years of temporary .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le honest and full @-@ time actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there are a new container in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for connecting people who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for connecting the commun@@ es .
you need to put the refugees in their own or rented dormit@@ ories .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the country and in the commune and job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time than very difficult .
the management does not find private apartments .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t work so far , so you are dependent on private apartments , so deu@@ ch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , non @-@ collective apartments need to be explored , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ hing Road . &quot;
&quot; however , only with apartments it is not done . &quot;
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a firm lead , there are train@@ sets , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , training courses , One @-@ euro @-@ jobs and foreigners for refugees and migrants who have found themselves or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help home power , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very tidy , such as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact .
&quot; that is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean just work .
&quot; the day needs a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and the customer . &quot;
people would have to develop an intimate feeling .
&quot; so it offers offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ar .
&quot; so , you also jump to manage and volunteers . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they were in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can sense the time useful , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , who will never integrate . &quot;
the clear majority thereof is motivated .
&quot; but problem may also be , says customer honestly , &quot; people , where nothing goes . &quot; the work of deu@@ ch@@ le and customer therefore always be to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two after the recent pre@@ conditions are afraid of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher can call nai@@ ve . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could and would not want to ex@@ clude them . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zes are the hel@@ pers but already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they wouldn &apos;t have the fear that the attacks they are completely into rec@@ alled .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main - and volunteers will have to hold on site and in the region to work .
they always in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
needs Germany a border ?
this question is clear to answer the politics .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the location . &quot;
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already visible to integrate the hitherto human beings .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; however , if people are in need , they can help them both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political situation is so complex , there is no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : por@@ ters with helicop@@ ter wanted
the police helicop@@ ter flew around one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are embar@@ ked on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 p.m. in an apartment in an apartment house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the residents surprise the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ ess into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 26 meters in size , probably m@@ ask@@ ets , both Blu@@ e@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ f@@ eit@@ lis . &quot;
they refugees in the direction of downtown .
&quot; for the flag@@ ship , the police took several stri@@ pes as well as a police helicop@@ ter . &quot;
the flag@@ ship ran without success .
perhaps the unknown in fact fell close to the apartment or with their flight .
