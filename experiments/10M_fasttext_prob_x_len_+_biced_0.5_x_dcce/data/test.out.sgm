<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy compared to: it's all about money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the two US presidential policy are however, however, in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to be rather small in doubt and warns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to destroy the economy and adjust to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in contrast, he would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"it will make regulators massive, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private men and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has specific tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged chances and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would increase to the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the mts, Trump and Clinton say almost wore."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic application implies the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state of the state-of the Republicans-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump we could come to internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build carbon-power plants and to resume the carbon density in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton in contrast seeks to expand and demands renewable energy in its investment programme:" "a country will make the superpower the clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two rivals are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazide trade agreement, they both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US does not want to isolate the US to isolate the international trade but simply protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the should also be paid better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase her to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage, he says, he would not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months might likely be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand is Trump, which wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics consider him, so that the budget deficit would be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton is Clinton who wants to know at least from the rich people, that they pay more taxes and their critics say, more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, once they came in Germany, irre, tells them."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here, women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worse."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that, about 90 percent of women living in the north of Munich, are traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not made voluntary." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so habitual that they have nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often are not helping to assist, more accommodations are only for them, demands bills."</seg>

<seg id="38">"on the question whether they kissed from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, reply some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben, women alone are not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken there are some floors of floors or own houses for only one-standing women and their children."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of foreign banks"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and announce an official end to the eight months of long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but as Vladimir Putin, his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot deny myself that Ankara will not want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the rash, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile worked together, and he hardly spoke heat, even for its backward circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, talked to his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even further improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard, as if never had something terrible."</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to be the contrary to me rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin destifying, sustainable cooling showed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory scriptures: the abyss of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to like Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"this was even bigger, since it was committed by a alleged friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the Vetrust will rebuild it again, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the state-controlled media led an enormous, unlimited attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would carry the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious officials were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria would have benefited from the so-called" "Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it is time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan as an excuse he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a cease-fire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan needs first and foremost all friends who can get, after spending the last month at a failed coup d almost his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually spends several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agent and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a late tower of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week projected the paramount of parables, fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agriculture will be re-imported."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry in the West, since it's reaction to the tried out of power as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued Groll will come across the snentempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the awakening to pull out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state victory in Ankara won a bonus to ensure that he called for the elected state-rich support for the chosen state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep seated fear of a regiment."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one as it once described as a analyst," Alliance of foreign banks ": two countries that come across from west and treated badly and now join forces."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference between Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are contradictory."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of first talks both president on the press conference spoke, they had not even been striped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey prevented it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the light of the potential for a perfect Disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey got the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk together."</seg>

<seg id="21">But how does it balances the loss of more about 131300 apartments that will be able to run over the next few years?</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"that teenage boys and children to play no longer outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time to staring on screens, became the last decade of many laments."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and finally limited to smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were built on the characters, which were first created for the video games in the 1990ern (later emerged as a cartoon, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of Popculture, the interest in the release of the game declined in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go out with their smartphones to outside and search for Pokémons which are tracked with a GPS as soon as they were once found" "photographed" "(about a screenshot on the phone) or 'captured."</seg>

<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to the performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness programmes on health, people want to bring about" "30 minutes" "to get involved" "from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day", "because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look like."</seg>

<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderful Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"however, there are also mürric toys that must always complain about something."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind, this video will show you how to rotate for your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind, you should turn off as a first place, so you can see your attacker and go out of the train line," "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the gun then between your front and your shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him then with the knee into the body and twisting, while the attacker is crashing pain, the weapon from his hands. hit him with the run and move back, while they turn the weapon to him."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel autor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk schabed his course on a euro archipelago, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a sink with a Zugtoilette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the check of each object, he used a Luminometer to show up and to show us what he is getting into."</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filtered under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to detach the dishwasher of a migrate toilette that has already been used by thousands of others, but actually are in a kitchen flush more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright said Mr Wright with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately there was nothing left, what he encloses, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>

<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations up to dishwashers of toilets, the task assigned to its immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told me:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was just meeting his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he clipped, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial showed a Luminometernumber of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometeries are freshly curved hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that refused to reject, after their Luminometerre over 4000 units was, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valid produced the" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number at different places like the bathroom "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he says:" "this comes the worst thing I have in a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will find nothing here because it is inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company employs Mr Wright with Valid Freezeout, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories of Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumer a little new. "</seg>

<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and by documentary film we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added:" let me say so - I have lost my respect for Ian when he had gotten some of the things that I have relied on him, just like the ekelastic Russian toilet that will be shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things when it was easier to bring Ian to put them into and others with which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">"I am glad, that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of valio survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents performed lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and bowel and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products, which included as a lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"now than so far, it is not: summer holidays, heat and land-meeting."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the constituencies, are on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the tourists who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not natives, so are not allowed to choose the land day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in addition, practical issues: in the holidays are helpers, the posters attach, balloons, flyer, and end up in the end of the votes only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until the 4th of September 2016, the electoral and last Ferientag, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again make an election campaign just under the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot stage, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, since 1998 is the strongest party, now lies in surveys clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">"exciting is how strong newcomer AfD cuts, and what remains at the end of coalizing ducts."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister, makes an almost unobtrusive electoral campaign, one sees from its wholesominations."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributed roses and chat a little with the people, just as it did already know his legendary previous predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Zeering has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel gives blame on the flowering of the Afak."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your refugee policy, you" "We create that" "have accelerated the ascent of the spopulists, which now probably cost him the nice office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its peak-channel data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has experienced as it is when one makes at the wrong time at the right place of choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice a chancellor Angela Merkel and invited by Merkel and Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel."</seg>

<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of gedults for example - raises the question: what does this have to do with certainty and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizère, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to speak that the attacks by Ansbach and Würzburg refugees were.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men mean middle ages loving plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you go to the commuter, to transfer him under the pseudonym non-deceleration of men with rotating insulators, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the renunciation of sound records is not considered to have a boom in millennials that want to welcome the rency of physical objects, but attributed to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all prediction of between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely Käuer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">"there is also no horror by hobbyters - it has an emotional meaning: older records of records retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while in the midst of a busy road in Soho course, a modest street reckled and wild silicates before I steal, my hands stop and some point of saying as:" "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us take a look at that.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos happens slowly at his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera probably to switch the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I followed by Sister Ray (data): two young women, three men middle ages, a woman, probably about 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, question I?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this record is pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not sent to him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he is now able to buy plates that he had appeared and again to buy items that he sold, when he was young and plainly."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, where I probably had something to young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and will gladly spend time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't smoke very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my loaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"GMT, 25, who works for Sister Ray, believes that many customers meet, which he meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and let themselves be prompted to buy again its old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people generally have sinned around 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to a trailer of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to recognize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers took a clash to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull themselves back to the stability of confidential sound-boards, of objects, the happy Jugenderinnings. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the feeding of a void or property materially possessions as a kind of comfort", "says WEZ."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as collectors "and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social worker!" "soldered an employee of a record stacks."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people bought a record, they have not yet been consulted."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy one record, do not possess a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very anxious while through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three men aged man), has noticed a" trophy "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiator record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it is definitely going."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-lashing, less musiklasy."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older that will come slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted to the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has an underlined crowd when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos make, Teenagejungs and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-standing stores is - Wild Beasts neuester Syntist, and sexbepacked Pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks sonically lonely, but nagging mental traumas are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the business for a few minutes and considered the variation of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a showcase of immortal as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a loved sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, told that a new generation of record lovers has to be inspired: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the name the jeans-Hotpants to muting, watch a group of young teenager, grouped for a moment for Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of tops of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees her - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to put them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research inquiries make sure the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in records in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record lovers, which exist in reality, plate operations and in Onlineforen, unconsidered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through records of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while passing the rigid sight of an unconscious, 30-year-old moderator, who crosses over the shoulders of the middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="31">Many of the suspects at attacks on asylum seekers were not previously known as criminals to politically motivated prosecutor or supporters of the right scene.</seg>

<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who has been playing for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, could well be listed under these known names, built up to Prime Time, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even fool."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampoline by gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports, which are not generally recognized: air guns, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the flippers and may it reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me direct attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>

<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a refreshed enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never endsetting rivery - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving that combines two sports that it essentially combines.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protested during the clashes with the police have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia precisely to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years it was one of the most stabilising countries of Africa, a solid association with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months the protests against the government broke out the country and expanding themselves in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week stormy thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot on zig unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"changing videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show like security-people young people with staves, while these were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN-Authority of Human Rights is now asking a close investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and in future it becomes even harder," "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new extension in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy, human rights organisations have continuously led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited, where dissidents were effective to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options apart from protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopies. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the ground-use until the stranglehold imposed in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a vast choice of last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this zag, controversial line called in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years have been more or less imposed, the turmoil will benefit more or less."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of decreasing out of himself under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, a lot of Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media as cheap smartphones have become more and more common and the Internet services have improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government ignores the access to Facebook and Twitter what it does in regular intervals, especially during protests, many people still have to communicate via internet proxies that conceal from where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them that they were gathered together for protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons prosperied the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian high countries, in politics and economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, many of which are living and living in flat-land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray which constitute about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former vine, was up to his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly sealed in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks in this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new Prime Minister - Hailemariam Desalegn was chosen for relatively recent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came out of the Tigray region Northern Ethiopians, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst said that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, Ethiopia was killed such a turmoil, after thousands of elections protested by the government who were seemingly fueled and stolen from the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following sweeps, many protagonists were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and that time of unrest was passed quite quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia as leaders of their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendler train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"the last month of attacked protested in Gondar, an amharical city, of Tigray-held shops and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests of the USA and other Western allies bring a peculiar position in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently voiced that it has concluded that base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to clearly support democracy, he does not want his allies in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin mute."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself, when he said, the Russians should be Mrs. Clint Editions, but later he said" "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to ruin.</seg>

<seg id="17">"but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even estimating sound, since its umerable values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who was released on Friday showed a lead with a great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative utterances, he frequently confuses his critics to distorted his statements or to understand his sense of humor."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Greenland-haie, they usually come to the surface only in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good one 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönland-haie will only get more than 150 years old.</seg>

<seg id="8">"only when it depends on, the five meters long animal accelerates 2,6 km / h - and this maximum speed is half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">This one-shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal" Science "at any rate of Greenland, the 392 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," said Alexander Scharlein from Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"though, the evolutionary biologist had long been that Greenland-haie became a stone."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only faulted the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are difficult to watch, eventually they live mainly in the ice-sea from the thin coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they dive at the surface mostly in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"over the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know accordingly little."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your time-stempo moderation they, when they used six animals with one transmitter for six animals."</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this haie nevertheless: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had the pinewest of a young ice-bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they are hunting asleep animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice and are looking for carcasses who are from higher water layers to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a head-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long while the biggest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, analyzes them with the carbon-14 method the lens of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelet is already created before the birth of sharks, which in the proteins included in it will be no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lenses.</seg>
<seg id="25">"as a result, your birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s than nuclear-weapon tests, in the atmosphere of this radioactive carbon."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of 220 centimeters the length of third creature contained the lens, against a low overcast of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon-weapon, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-haie had normal carbon-14 levels in their lenses, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 centimetres long Greenland is an old age of 335 years, during the record-shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old may be."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females only then got afterward, when they are longer than four meters, was well known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could be assigned to an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters were probably at the threshold of the sexually mature, and his age was destined for 156 years, Grönland-haie with the multiplication obviously have at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">"also, this is likely to be the world record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in cold waters is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland-wal, in whose bacon the neck woke up a 120 year old harpokes, was captured before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on sparsely."</seg>
<seg id="36">So you mature later - and age slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep yourself warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume increases much faster than its surface, by which the animal gives heat control."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram" "Elephant". ""</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on making as many descendants as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Schiller. "</seg>

<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was rundown.</seg>

<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of Malware, Malwarebytes from 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were surveyed at least once, partly several times victims of a attack with Erpresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a ransomware extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialised in their presses software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to erpressive ransom is significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we're monitoring a startling rapid evolution of the damage software," explained Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising material.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then, the perpetrators discovered embeating software for itself."</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private, he was the target, but the change to company attacking took place in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ranseware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an oppressor, it seeks targeted after inlong changed files such as Word-, excel- or database files as well as for archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the press.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files must be the victims money - usually in the form of cryptodaytime Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users use the personal photo database on the game, it is about companies around sensitive customers or project databases without which the production still stands."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the operation completely in a case, in a case people were in danger."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of self-acts."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: do not pay, you only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators of stagnation in the operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try everything to set up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researcher of F-secure the user surfaces and contact with the presses are investigated and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually attempting to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, direct free support websites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and are individuals who solves after payments of a few hundreds of Euro, companies have to negotiate on hard and five-digit amounts to get back their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ransomware extortion, the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains security expertly Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus supplier Sophos:" a single person may write a ransomware about within one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, it is that it is about three or four people."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine customers from the labour circle indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle now is, the eiving Wollmilchsau, which has mainly a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less mockingly had to be focused on the variety of areas of tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the area of social work, even an icy wounds."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization to work with local people and also behind the scenes and mains."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent focus on three years of temporary.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle honest and full-time actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are a new container in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for connecting people who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting the communes.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to put the refugees in their own or rented dormitories.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the country and in the commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">The management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"it doesn't work so far, so you are dependent on private apartments, so deuchle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, non-collective apartments need to be explored, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, soon new containers will be placed in the Washing Road."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, only with apartments it is not done."</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a firm lead, there are trainsets, apprenticeships, training courses, One-euro-jobs and foreigners for refugees and migrants who have found themselves or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help home power, do charitable work - and this motivates and very tidy, such as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean just work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and the customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop an intimate feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it offers offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, you also jump to manage and volunteers."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they were in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can sense the time useful, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, who will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority thereof is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but problem may also be, says customer honestly," people, where nothing goes. "the work of deuchle and customer therefore always be to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two after the recent preconditions are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer quite clearly," "what mancher can call naive." a Restrisiko could and would not want to exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitizes are the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They wouldn't have the fear that the attacks they are completely into recalled.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main - and volunteers will have to hold on site and in the region to work.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Needs Germany a border?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the location."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already visible to integrate the hitherto human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"however, if people are in need, they can help them both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political situation is so complex, there is no simple answers."</seg>
