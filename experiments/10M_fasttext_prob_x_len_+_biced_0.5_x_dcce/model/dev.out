Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the International Agreement and Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; but at the meeting , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been very excited for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing colon@@ isation of Israel and Netanyahu re@@ jects a lack of peace in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal of Obama &apos;s accounting for the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu announced on the invitation of the Republi@@ cans against the U.S. Congress a controversial speech made , some had been evaluated as an affin@@ ity against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the im@@ pending election of Israel . &quot;
in a call @-@ back professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon represented with a somewhat tre@@ ad voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his home . &quot;
&quot; Lamb , it was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably be excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , officials got the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ described not@@ z that I was doing it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; this was about the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he has traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi p@@ aired , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed on the police of the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that univers@@ ally employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he did the fatal emergency right after it .
until the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took life as the police bo@@ iler him .
&quot; a day after shooting at the University , the students and lectur@@ ers come to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details issued by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in the Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned himself in one of his written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the department of social sciences and history , whose faculty are 17 members , and many students had attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some dis@@ likes to solve problems .
&quot; he was a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb , said , he also seemed a bit up@@ set and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University in order to have asked for health reasons for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he set only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for the Lamb , had worked so hard for him to represent no guarantee for an automatic way to position as Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; Universal president William La@@ For@@ ge said , he found nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot;
these are questions that &apos;s not able to answer .
after the flight from the campus the police took a later Lam@@ bs track than he was back in Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
&quot; he could be arrested , killed self @-@ employed with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his par@@ house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran still in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; he began in 2009 his work at the University of 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he took his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs made him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through joint friends .
&quot; she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar game . &quot;
in the time he was the Frau@@ ensch@@ warm .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted by then , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the call , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; you had a dog called light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to one Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were left for 15 years ago , but friends were stayed and a daughter had been 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he has never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that she was interested in music and played music . &quot;
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ er when he came up for three years ago both on a summer and a year@@ ling market .
later they played together with one or the other g@@ ig .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings to her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sh@@ af@@ fer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes under@@ wear coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ dent Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September last time , after his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ ol@@ iel ended in front of a sp@@ icy audience . &quot;
there were no signs of that anything did not coinci@@ de .
&quot; simply a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the t@@ aming and cher@@ ished together .
&quot; yes , I mean , they both had a good sense for am@@ usement . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; back to the Future &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot;
and it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I see that the seat beside me is empty , and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; back in Time . &quot;

&quot; the Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says , its response to Russia enhanced military support to Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;

8 re@@ frag@@ ances that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks , in surveys , it has ( yet ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national poll@@ s showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ digit range , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election . &quot;
nobody cont@@ ends that Tru@@ mp will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; Rick experts say that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Herman C@@ ain in 2011 , none of which was given only a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he could have struggling in a general election .
&quot; but outside groups , like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s inv@@ itations and begin to let their dollars will flow to pl@@ unge it . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Beli@@ efs values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp was announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
until mid July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
some three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and those figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good idea of tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans , they would either be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son brings about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , which tell the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in matters of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters do that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; up@@ set &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ can sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and ab@@ usive statements , 52 per cent of the Republi@@ cans believes that the real temper@@ ament has a right temper@@ ament for President , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number holds true in the first op@@ tionally state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 per cent believed that he does not have the personality to effectively execute the post , and nearly six out of 10 accidents say that temper@@ ament is not into the White House , so ABC / post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters do get used to the idea .
&quot; if they are setting up their schol@@ ar , Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp are for real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked who is most asked to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C over the past week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp was the best bet . &quot;
that is a change from the time when four out of ten will put its money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle four out of ten republi@@ cans , that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination towards just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was seen as a plau@@ sible .
&quot; even when the Republi@@ can gathered around a different candidate , Tru@@ mp will meet almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the frag@@ mented field is likely to be a tru@@ mp@@ s guided tour , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp &apos;s support . &quot;
&quot; he has seen before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp @-@ fans say that they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half the voters who support Tru@@ mp , say that they will forgive her voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that and no one can really say , never change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said they leave the door open , to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless Tru@@ mp@@ s strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made themselves formed , are twice as common to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 republi@@ cans say , that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp in the topic of immigration . &quot;
&quot; since then , Donald Tru@@ mp was called in his election un@@ married couple of months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; was the immigration and fishing hub in public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that bom@@ bas@@ tic &apos;s expression of Tru@@ mp are decisive His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the New @-@ orient@@ ated efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six out of 10 republi@@ cans , that they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of migration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it will seem to do by Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the frustration of the government are clim@@ bed to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son is meanwhile as@@ cert@@ ained about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 republi@@ cans say in the new assembly survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register , Bloomberg in Io@@ wa has two weeks ago shows that three by four Io@@ wa republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the republi@@ cans in Congress with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive living dwell@@ ings in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg , there is the most expensive residence with a view over the North Sea . &quot;
in the street it costs a square meter @-@ roof in the cut 73.@@ 300 euro .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is not limited , &quot; stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which special le@@ agues are a square meter at the most . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , one of the prices comes from Pe@@ anu@@ ts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Angel@@ ele has published a leaderboard of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in dro@@ pping high@@ s .
&quot; there are several tens of Euros of nothing - per square meter , well @-@ held . &quot;

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ fold Tor@@ ar@@ cher in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just took a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller took the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 on Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran it .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have completed a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the crew of Trainer P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola won their pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek rec@@ ord@@ amp Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage cans ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es Displaying ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth start of the series is to be the first step in the finals on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich on May 28 . &quot;
Müller took place at his 28th hits in the Champions League of the Champions League of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ to@@ Roberto which happen to happen as a fl@@ ange of the World &apos;s World .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate they , &quot; was Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis &apos;s stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner held Word . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and committed idea , without sh@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his recent six home games in the Royal House , including well @-@ known clubs , like Manchester United , Tro@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 proud here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ Du@@ els with Greek teams , would not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went mut@@ ed , but with their offensive efforts , but often too einf@@ all@@ s@@ los to works . &quot;
the attacks were often passed on to cross @-@ border on Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa Rica that came through the former Braunschweig Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right side than his side ri@@ pped from the right sem@@ inal field in the upper left corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half an had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; initially , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ as Brown struck the head@@ ball from Poland by the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct closing , the go@@ alie &apos;s Roberto with his knee ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bavaria was created in the dominant game , it could tigh@@ ten Piraeus . &quot;
on the door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er but was Lost .
so about when he wrote a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 06 ) .
&quot; prior to Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola sent a quad@@ ran@@ qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center alongside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cart , sat first outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given only after the exclusion of green light , he said sports presented Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that is more mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sl@@ ey Com@@ an for the attached Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6 ) and 13 minutes later everything realized , by El@@ f@@ meter he sat down again . &quot;
in front of the game it was set in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly killed Bayern fans in their audience @-@ Block , the supporters of the hosts pir@@ ate Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and ges@@ tures had prov@@ oked , attacked the security forces and went with head@@ lines against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner trailer . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was transported from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only burst the lungs , but also the teeth - that sets a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : he reduces the risk quickly .
smokers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this arises from the long @-@ term study of a international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , there was the risk to waste their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , in order to increase the 2.5@@ X to 3,@@ 6 times . &quot;
the scientists had seen more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
&quot; the main causes for dental loss is c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for this par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis is a risk factor to emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of waste is therefore rever@@ ber@@ ated to most frequent g@@ um re@@ treats in g@@ oth@@ ol@@ es .
&quot; not yet , however , if smoking is also raised the risk of tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who heard by smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; however it could take over ten years until the threat comes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ ec@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich in the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man must convince people of them to become non @-@ smoking , explained the university leader H@@ a Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoke shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not too smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good tooth profile all the way to the high age .
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 have been affected by tooth decay , the DI@@ B distributed . &quot;
earlier investigations have already been noted that smoking increases the risk of early @-@ down dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study em@@ as@@ ons the findings .

TTIP is supposed to develop the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
&quot; the plans for the reform of the arbit@@ ration proceedings make it concrete , that the EU @-@ States and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
for the first time this is also a second instance .
they would allow it to raise against ur@@ ges .
&quot; until now the procedure of proced@@ ural among each other with the refer@@ ee , there was no possibility of in@@ consistency against their jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become obvious that citizens are not familiar to the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice , &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Tribunal . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , could also be clari@@ fied between Chinese companies and the EU countries . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) were regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against the TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ rators will be cri@@ tici@@ zed by the opponents as a kind of parallel adju@@ sting , about the company &apos;s damages to the payers of tax@@ payers , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act the proposals submitted by the European Commission as inadequate .
it was especially cri@@ tici@@ zed that it has not been dealt with for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic state Secretary by Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) describes the plans on the other hand as a great progress .
&quot; the Commission considered one of the reform essential points , the Federal Ministry of Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration were from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned that the economy &apos;s cl@@ ues to limit the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; very small and medium enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it says . &quot;
&quot; when the talks about the TTIP , TTIP ( Trans@@ atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) must be completed on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US . &quot;
it was originally meant to be a framework for the agreement at the end of this year .
this date is no longer ten@@ able .

&quot; the entire public , about 40 persons , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens Talk . &quot;
&quot; it tells the basis of various places , which he is repeat@@ ed@@ ely represented on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs report . &quot;
&quot; where they have emerged , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be wonderful and more creative .
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; &quot; greetings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear cl@@ ever@@ ly comp@@ elled songs , which can harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American Folk of the late six@@ ties , but always look at the great op@@ ul@@ ent dri@@ fting at all times . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut on the issue of the Prime Minister with suspen@@ sions .
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should be his debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister and then head for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of its six given questions shortly after lunch and its performance from the media probably will be aud@@ ited .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave them counter@@ parts .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because she is after his appointment as a member of the shadow , and after his speech at TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of Labour publ@@ ishes on Tuesday during the singing of national hy@@ m@@ ne during a memorial to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ising the number of T@@ ory MPs , and is at the center of several preced@@ ents . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Mr Cor@@ by@@ n he would have been &quot; respectful of silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he got to sing the Labour President , to sing national hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ te leadership , and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a Six@@ th of the parliament initially supported him as leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences must also be st@@ acking within Labour , namely by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements to the position of the European Union and the limit of violence . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put Labour proposals in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; later Mr Smith said Mr Smith , the shadow of employment and pensions government that the party &quot; very clear &quot; means that they are only against government plans , to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss , over the last decade to face the Dis@@ patch box in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the issue of the Prime Minister is to con@@ front@@ al , and that he has conducted both &quot; impact &quot; and the quar@@ rel@@ ies with contradictions , and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle who is represented to him because he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron wants to move away from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the issue of the Prime Minister . but a couple of years later he sto@@ cked that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since they were first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was founded with the Prime Minister as a principal bar@@ ometer for his leader in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament , though critics argue , have become a caric@@ ature and cas@@ ap@@ ed widespread reforms . &quot;

&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was clim@@ bed up to 12 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed with an increase of 1,4 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .

&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of fiction , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , in its shop a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ultur@@ al of the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has now led to the Leb@@ an@@ esis in Munich in the meantime .

Met@@ cash laun@@ ches Ground Support campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ -
met@@ abolic tries to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ alen in front of an Al@@ di event in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ alers Met@@ rolog@@ ers has launched a ground level to defend the market share of Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia soon prepare their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via social media , just as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers have been aboard , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores and shop@@ ke@@ epers , who sell passenger tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash out further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , if the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices through its annual Invest@@ ors &quot;
there is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia get nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shop@@ pers and increase higher profits as a met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A network in Eastern states .
&quot; purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di will catch twelve months after the opening of its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states , and all the available players , but mainly autonomous retailers . &quot;
a report published in this week by the analy@@ st Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ ret@@ ailer 360 $ million annual revenue per year and generate 250 million euros up to the end of 2016 .
&quot; this pre@@ diction is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened in WA and 30 million in WA , and achieved sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss of food and grocery and in the quantities of a high @-@ cost base , met@@ cash might cost roughly 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares lost in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan had discovered that Ig@@ A @-@ Single have been the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes the fact that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 to decrease 4.9 percent in 2017 and 2.8 percent in 2015 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne that would probably disappear within a decade . met@@ cash disappear . &quot;
they ref@@ ra@@ ve to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; however , it is assumed that a member member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ As market share has declined since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs , food and grocery stores , which around 1.200 has dropped by 43 per cent , which is refl@@ ecting the operative school building on both turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ alers ad@@ mired , however , and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million , to increase sales trips by hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and deliver better choice of private @-@ label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business guide Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and loading programs to be seized and hopes that the wholes@@ alers will return to profit in 2017 for the first time in 2017 . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves rather praise as critic@@ isms for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as critic@@ isms for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger the talented du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; gr@@ ated by the in@@ famous confrontation of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka to the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ akis had to be separated and separated twice by the refer@@ ee whereby Har@@ rison had to beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should propose the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a new US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet was ver@@ ted , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was def@@ aul@@ ted by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the Teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in order to win the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against the United Kingdom . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I heard quite , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a little in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost because of a battle in the US Open , but he is not the first player who crus@@ hed a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has in the US Open extremely well @-@ behavior , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around you , he has a great family around you , and I believe that he was not treated very much . &quot;
&quot; he is a very rei@@ gn@@ ant 19 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he never fits into the team and so on , he has never worked out a problem with the other players , he is well trained in form , he is a very stur@@ dier and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision @-@ facing , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all round the controllers around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I believe Nick was very quick that he did so quickly , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray took me , but we try to assist him to understand him the consequences of his actions . some time out of the spot@@ light , in which he can only think it , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;
European refugee crisis : Hungary explained emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explained the emergency , and led the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all the notes which tried to stop illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the goal to stop influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants gathered themselves in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials with rebellion . &quot;
&quot; the people who were escap@@ ed before violence , fought for an unknown period at the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents , and settled down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations accomplished .
&quot; as a police helicop@@ ter over them ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; over@@ thrown the border &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elling Bel@@ ts against the Hungarian civilian police . &quot;
some meadows made from protest foods and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign ministers stated that &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would go back from Hungary to arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ als .
&quot; in the coming days we have to take place in Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il in the hung@@ arian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were sentenced to Italy and Greece at the over@@ age of Italy and Greece . they op@@ ted their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would take further 120@@ 000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put its hopes for an im@@ pending promotion of Brussels or its neighbours .
&quot; the not@@ with@@ standing staff in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis , so that they could over@@ sight streets away and asylum . &quot;
&quot; said , the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also has the construction of a sp@@ iny wireless za@@ ite along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence at the Ser@@ b border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even Pr@@ isons in the competition , to create the bar@@ bed wire connection between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant level of war for many war@@ es from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and has become a major step into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that most of the coming economies are in search of a better life , and not in battle , have the claim to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which appeared at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the sham@@ eful of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high with us that led the government alongside the southern border to Serbia . these laws also put higher shar@@ pen@@ alties for the condemned human traffic@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ ac Repor@@ ting in the southern City of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military even for next week , but the Repor@@ ter from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavy soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , Land @-@ Security Consult@@ ant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have had gone into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by def@@ ying the fence , they are now in police officers , and will be accused of crimes of crimes in accordance with the new laws . &quot;
authorities are thereby to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a draw@@ cord with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders , arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ ged the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and op@@ pressing a crowd to turn around there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 I managed to come into , but thousands were left outside . &quot;
another group of migrants dre@@ ds the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said that she would refuse to travel to Hungary until Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t Vor@@ sprung from Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit anticip@@ ation in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination on the national level , but Sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders wins its opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders are second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not proclaimed , whether he receives the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the presidential elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is strong , which candidates will support them . &quot;
&quot; however , Clin@@ &apos;s supporters are more per@@ severe in their choice than those of the other candidates . &quot;
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton had lost in a series of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders had achieved some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have less@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men has dropped sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders here lies only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ &apos;s benefit in democratic elections under 50 years of age has accelerated , and they are now on the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , Clinton had a big lead in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; in the last month Clinton had been against a double @-@ digit aspir@@ ation with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the elections pro@@ found@@ ly say that they would support us with enthusiasm if they would be nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some advantages , and another 15 percent would only support it because they are the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons are current suppor@@ ter above all of her are thrilled .
the views are more mixed with those who currently support Clinton - just about a quarter would like her to assist .
&quot; during 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say they Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters do this about their peak of Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ ton supporters are asked in an open question , why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; according to Clin@@ &apos;s supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; consent to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate , are also c@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the vice @-@ president sees its potential for the Pres@@ idential office in the commodity , would like 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the hel@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t followers say more than half that it would have been a different choice for their second choice . &quot;
&quot; decide for the nom@@ ination of democr@@ ats , does not decide for the nom@@ ination of democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t &apos;s lead increases too differently , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in competition to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; bid@@ ding is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage who sees it as the &quot; selected &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important when a candidate , the democratic voters call on the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the elections as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates absol@@ ut@@ ures good results in some important features by voters the presidential elections .
&quot; Clinton look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership . &quot;
&quot; flex@@ ing cuts in the three candidates best at honesty , while Clin@@ t strength is leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about sin ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any idea of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters for the elections see also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ology in accordance with their views . &quot;
with all these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of anything .
&quot; as questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t &apos;s use of a personal email address and server during the term as an out@@ minist@@ erial mandate , most of the Democratic voters are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were overall influenced . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was held in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said their opinion is still worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 people say that Clinton had become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered elec@@ torate : only 32 percent will see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month , and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of people entitled to vote hold them not for a honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elec@@ torate justified land@@ wide also tru@@ mp is not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are however good notes with leadership .
&quot; of the six people tested candidates , B@@ ats , Car@@ son and Bush are best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards this rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the fault of the number for the sample of 3@@ 51 R@@ elec@@ tors in the presidential elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is fast moving forward to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the support of the elec@@ torate was in the new survey , and others decline dramatically in stability . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters support land@@ wide strike in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox news debate last month to 27 % in survey conducted by Tuesday .
but car@@ son fell from 6 % at 23 % in the same time .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well in the demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ rendered tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ uns , who has fallen in tune with Wis@@ dom , Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is at the deepest but from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % in third place .
the error code at the sampling of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he lan@@ det by 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp significantly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at one of the last week increasing Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp took some side @-@ s for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign appearances in Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant bathing @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if top values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean has already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a dip in North or Baltic is likely to be a maximum of 17 degrees a rather short pleasure .
&quot; no longer goes to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and the Baltic Sea took part in this week , the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other side , bathing temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; on the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ otherhood from the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; almost two years after a student during a schi@@ kan@@ oid ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will mo@@ urn for against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory mat@@ ing in September 2013 , and consumed its transport to the hospital , which led to his death , distributed the police . &quot;
&quot; officials spoke , he was filled with related eyes with a 30 t @-@ pounds back@@ pack of sand , and repeated , while trying to as@@ sign over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g said finally about head@@ ache , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood did not calling the emergency number of 911 because Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ ths clothing , his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Br@@ otherhood , to get advice , said police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide among U@@ ten@@ si@@ ls and presented the well @-@ being of the Br@@ otherhood through Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not revi@@ ve ; and he died next morning at his wo@@ unds .
&quot; after a car@@ riages , Den@@ g were repeated with st@@ ump@@ y force inj@@ uri@@ ous to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sli@@ ding of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies from 1970 every year on the sh@@ kan@@ en , &quot; Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step of government authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members for the first five members .
&quot; thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for schi@@ zop@@ attacks and forming a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take charge of the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has - officially or officially , we will also hold it to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Br@@ otherhood , and the Br@@ otherhood has resist@@ ed its affili@@ ation to the city group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed has increased interest rates
&quot; Zin@@ no@@ stri@@ ung is coming , and the household will fall into sl@@ ender , return for bonds , and the economy will shine in a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it all take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only low instructions on how to do it . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first level of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve on the lifting of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the U.S. central bank have stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase the interest rates but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables are playing a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could discover that the whole excitement because of an interest rate could possibly be exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication on customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at the lowest level to lead to sei@@ sm@@ ic shock , which seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
&quot; here , speci@@ alizing in historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities may do things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase is executed , the influence is not that dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth income is with@@ drawn from 12 to 24 months after the first raise , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study of what happens to Zin@@ c@@ cul@@ es of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has mostly been in the area in the last 35 years - about 14 percent - on its way to zinc @-@ height , fairly flat in the last six months , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , head @-@ Strateg@@ e in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the increases cycle and return returns to decrease .
rec@@ essions include a fact of economic survival but Zin@@ l@@ eries often promote them .
&quot; in the current case the F@@ ed has faced some conditions , which could not previously existed and could speed up a recession . &quot;
&quot; extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is located near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , from 1950 Zin@@ l@@ its since 1950 was only twice nominal GDP in 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.2 percent , only few that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; zinc @-@ caves with such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year to a Zin@@ c@@ cul@@ ation of the F@@ ed and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
&quot; while many shr@@ ines and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all increases of increases from 1950 to today in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and on @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; thus the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a very slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm revenue was also vol@@ ati@@ l since the market is taking an interest rate , and the pattern is similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds faster than for shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds appear to switch returns once the first increase / reduction in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the increasing cycle , the bond m@@ alls immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believed that the increase in the interest rates will lead to , return between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a flat@@ ness of the curve . &quot;
&quot; bonds can often boost growth in such climate , although &quot; we still war@@ y to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , Jones means that the markets already have adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of str@@ ingent monetary policy &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield , len@@ ghts have increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity of the market has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed have intensified their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies that benefit most of their operations in the United States will benefit from interest rates and interest rates rise and local products more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debts are worse , as an ascen@@ ding dollar is making their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to be very positive to react three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have out@@ performed companies with a growing balance sheet after each of its interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital profits , as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares also met their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) . &quot;
debts are a major problem .
&quot; company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
outside of pure stock @-@ games consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollars .
&quot; austerity could see profits from higher yields , even if experts are different from different opinions as quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Spe@@ aker Andrew Bin@@ gham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the transmitter because of its &quot; &quot; dual resolution &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that she im@@ ited only The Br@@ its
&quot; colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the Voice of The Voice and said , that this is not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliamentary member and raises up new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do anything that the private station does not . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MP Andrew Bin@@ gham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that one of the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ sers , said &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished by its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to become Classic FM &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also performed on the BBC Music Awards that started in the last December 2013 .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , started in the past year , The Br@@ its seem to be only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ aneously examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr Bin@@ gham said . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director , dismis@@ sed the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competi@@ tor , when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public . &quot;
what I learn from Radio 3 l@@ erne I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the dedication of radio 3 to find new music and giving new works to order , I also consider it very important &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that harder to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , provided during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for this under fire , taking commercial ri@@ vals on his feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MEP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins , The Voice on - the musical Talent Show of the BBC who was bought by Dutch manufacturer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not an original one , and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC fashion .
&quot; he added that he wishes to find that the company &quot; &quot; hit a hit out of our house , &quot; &quot; if the next time there was a conversation series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to ex@@ clude the money of ag@@ it@@ ators for other sub @-@ operation formats . &quot;
Internet turnover clim@@ bed in August on the slo@@ west and Black Friday kit can be responsible for it
&quot; during the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent of sales in online selling . &quot;
in the last month there was the lowest profit since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobil@@ es to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday is slo@@ wed down by the Black Friday in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shop has dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into spirit @-@ capitals . &quot;
&quot; but experts say that there are now signs that st@@ alls on the online revenue , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that on @-@ sales st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers were only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for years and go back until 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG @-@ Verkauf@@ sin@@ e.html to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the sales sales were increased by three years ago , as a buyer , with their hand purchases single purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could purchase online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the couch . &quot;
&quot; but now it comm@@ utes this , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is being quoted as a reason for subsequent ren@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers can hold their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event , which occurred in November last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times retired as the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers turned off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the Bu@@ yer are fighting for bar@@ gain , buyers from this could hold sh@@ ado@@ wed . &quot;
&quot; a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium discovered that 5 £ spending was spent a little more than 1 £ online . &quot;
&quot; with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now done via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of the people are buying clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion labels in the field . &quot;
Muslims buried the in Mecca when crane accident involving fat@@ alities - Bin Lad@@ ens family becomes sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ gs in Mecca by the streets

Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already confirmed that the p@@ add@@ ings to Mecca with thousands who continues to arrive to city will go on .
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would have not ste@@ er the arm of the sick , when he was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of the de@@ par@@ rot issued by the state of Saudi Press Agency told that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the English @-@ language services of the news agency reporting this detail , but said that the management of the company are not forbidden . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this week Sal@@ man vo@@ wed to un@@ cover what has caused the overthrow of the Crane , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in front of the p@@ add@@ les , which will gather later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group did not have any statements on the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not there for an opinion . &quot;
the King Dec@@ ree was also bl@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it does not co @-@ operate with mete@@ or@@ ologists .

&quot; the crash of the Crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is needed at least once in a lifetime of any healthy . &quot;

it is claimed that British hold its h@@ amm@@ ers and br@@ ushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home
&quot; if you are being sent with a hammer or a brush to the range from walls , you seem to appear to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; because British are increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to carry out @-@ do jobs in their houses , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , new leader from King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , offer services to low prices have meanwhile been out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that connect to arti@@ sans and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are hit by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men prevail over the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households , the more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this into a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who listed one of only five women at the head of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed companies , also hon@@ ed their top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company who occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Super@@ visory Board .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her announces a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the revenue , after the group over@@ looks the cost of the closing of the stores . &quot;

functional of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
at the Landes@@ bank Kl@@ agen@@ furt have joined the Austrian Volley@@ ball @-@ Viz@@ er A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and issu@@ ing attraction .
the def@@ endants is not guilty .
one of them was charged with abuse of am@@ abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been acqu@@ itted more vigor@@ ously in May right . &quot;
the current process has been postponed .
&quot; according to the upper @-@ state lawyer , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in pre @-@ investigations that the accused in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from association accounts , over which they are disp@@ at@@ ted in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage resulting from around 400,000 Euros . &quot;
the sport @-@ functional are also charged with financial support .
&quot; this fact divided the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ate , Rich@@ ard@@ Micha@@ ela San@@ in , Germany . &quot;
this should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the cause of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence demonstrated that the association at no time had been a asset . &quot;
&quot; the Sport@@ arian would only have been compens@@ ated for the sports club for whom it had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - passi@@ v@@ ated from the debts of 2001 round 60@@ 0.000 b@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ ,000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : we continue to un@@ lock the club or block it ? &quot; , &quot; one of the accused , in the Br@@ ot@@ hel@@ f of the financial bank . &quot;
he decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have passed money for our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said in the acceptance of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , there may only be no debt . &quot;
&quot; furthermore - in the context of financial - success , the withdrawal of the in@@ ex@@ cements by 1991 had been decided by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one might have been ash@@ amed of the incident only years later , in the year 2003 when a plus had been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump ra@@ eli - and not detail finishes , the former Ob@@ man explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and ed@@ books managed the two def@@ endants , together , said the second accused . &quot;
why the payments to the association were not detailed to the association asked the judge .
&quot; however , the association has not been interested in detail for the financial discipline , be important only for the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the official investigation of am@@ pl@@ ums started , an amount of 120@@ .000 was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
these were had been in@@ appropri@@ ated ; explained the accused .
this paper@@ less account went on the name of the second accused and was not known as the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? , &quot; &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; after that , the respon@@ dents knew no answer . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he believed that this is the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor also stood in the room . &quot;
the collabor@@ ators should be notified of the function of function .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; har@@ n@@ ance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
why damage ? they wanted to know the judge and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; after that , the first accused did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never been a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; with whom are you all off the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a right representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the ten@@ ary , he never obtained a cent sal@@ ary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ eting , he added to the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not be the accused .
&quot; these were after a checking that has been assessed as correctly no longer , they said . &quot;
mil@@ eage had also taken the second indic@@ tee .
&quot; all containers must be paid in cash , in addition , he must go from his residence with the international market to the Bank of Per@@ burg , in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on the 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

&quot; the U.S. technology group is planning to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 offices in its corporate customer savings . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion should be saved ( EUR 2.7 billion ) , the company distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of approximately EUR 2.7 billion , which will start in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturing of 5@@ 5,000 jobs have not yet been completed . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US note bank
&quot; the world has been observed if the US stands out on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether it &apos;s been up@@ lifted for the first time since almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were asked by Reu@@ ters , found out that a little more than half the last week of the view was that F@@ ed to do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed is still somewhat longer waste , and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent will hold . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank might leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; Mr U@@ tility , director of employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ llion dollars to balance sheet and generate low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the markets to stop on an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
depos@@ itors on the Delta State University left their sorry
&quot; after the shoot and kill@@ ings of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague sl@@ ew and killed - wrote Sh@@ annon en a note to say that he would be &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in the Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that &apos;s opposition to Ge@@ ography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said , he was shot on someone and killed someone . &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that the police police officers must send to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house , but that &quot; nobody will be up@@ set , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
Lamb there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could und@@ one it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he took E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed , before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; Universal president William La@@ For@@ ge said , he found nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , which supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there are &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was draf@@ ted by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were about seven years married , than a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends were friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who died 19 and was destroyed by the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from at home , after statement from Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning who has been with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
&quot; the police said , I called relative to a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; he didn &apos;t go into prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later during that night , he drove his car to the side , ran into the woods and killed themselves with a shot . &quot;
&quot; he received a PhD title in spring 2015 by the Delta State University , like his life on the University website . &quot;
stars that have lost their god@@ wit@@ inger
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia ; and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner in Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
the actor also has to fight with drugs and in 2008 he was sentenced on account of drug owners .
all this certainly calls for its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of companies .
a half billion euros in the year will save Lufthansa companies alone with a better organisation .
150 of the worldwide approximately 1000 executives will cost the work@@ group in the workplace .
with the pilot &apos;s union there is the new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and value the Euro@@ wings .
&quot; goal of the real@@ ign@@ ment is to provide a contribution to a fee of some 500 million euros a year from cost and sol@@ em@@ syner@@ gies , the airline distributed on Wednesday with it . &quot;
&quot; among other things , in the Lufthansa there is no longer a member of the board for the passenger . &quot;
the Bil@@ ox@@ flu@@ gl@@ in@@ ie Euro@@ wings are to be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the previous team at the Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future . &quot;
&quot; with the new position , we also underlines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group will continue to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the river @-@ line company operated under the umbrella of the passage in Air@@ line Group , which represents the three quarters of an annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilot
&quot; in the collective @-@ conflict with the pilot &apos;s Cock@@ pit Association ( VC ) , the negotiations are scheduled to be resum@@ ed after the court of court . &quot;
this shared the union .
the theme of the talks should be the resting place for pilots .
cock@@ pit wants to come to a forecast result in a year with a forecast result &quot; as quickly as possible .
the conflict between the unions and Air@@ line has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; background is , in addition to the interim support of the pilots established the &quot; &quot; Spar@@ row &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it provides that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors , can be extrac@@ ted at the concert @-@ owned Bil@@ li@@ gl@@ in@@ ie Euro@@ wings . &quot;
under the title &quot; Morgen@@ n@@ ade &quot; in the south &quot; are paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger in the Ku@@ enst@@ l@@ erhaus to be seen .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play monthly
Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; as this brought the left defen@@ ders to wines and ex@@ clude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al did not hope that Sha@@ w will play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w has made in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; It has a double leg of leg and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operate in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very difficult and then fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double score , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
&quot; Moreno seemed to be happy , a red map and the suspension of a sl@@ it@@ ud@@ ly escape . &quot;
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the Ar@@ bit@@ or , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al believed that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ ration had mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself if I say , that a sl@@ ed meter and a red card was required . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ h account said , &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how cap@@ ut I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back again . &quot;
sales referred to : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at the PS@@ V
&quot; in France , the England def@@ ender has an additional incentive to relax until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; It is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury the place are all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
&quot; Moreno suffered a leg break , as Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team played at the World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , it is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only one I could see was the ball , who was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very badly here . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ance by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : when your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book was elected , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 was created by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the company of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to paint my children , for it seems always to have a picture or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron wanted to describe the plot of the book , instead found a feature of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; &quot; reads &quot; . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss was killed and the 1991 died , however completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads out partly like the abstract of the Lor@@ ax @-@ Films , which is all artificial , and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he does not give to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the story of the book . here &apos;s an un@@ ben@@ ded boy , like the local environment by the well @-@ winning Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ le @-@ edged Being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees &quot; , &quot; des@@ olate . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per deleg@@ ated by The Lor@@ ax not 20 times in a child . &quot;
a down@@ ing @-@ street spokes@@ person said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons electoral office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons has been delivered , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England , but it is still very difficult . &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but if one has chosen the K@@ ader , England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card . &quot;
I would not ex@@ clude a down@@ wards .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ looks is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars of 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful setting . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een is developing as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level is an option for the attack . &quot;
this news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves from the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are aimed at results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark upon Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
if he hopefully strikes further runs on Yor@@ k@@ shire has another chance .
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bav@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and I don &apos;t surprise me ; He is especially a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time will get a test head@@ man to get his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son prior to him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
just Comp@@ ton got the chance to do hom@@ e- and looking forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise up was that England first came to Jonathan in the Caribbean - as a Ly@@ th in peak form - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a drummer I highly interpret .
he is an X @-@ factor po@@ cket@@ player who saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire earlier this season when he recorded 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge square which met us very much .
&quot; it must obtain at least the same opportunities as the one before it , but it depends of course on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which would provide a extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler , and four qui@@ icks , would be de@@ af , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke can not kno@@ ck there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop , before playing in 2001 as an Open@@ er . &quot;
he had made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the K@@ ader as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he was very impressed by me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics on - an average of 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a unt , but there is no big number of back@@ ups that have their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Ros@@ awar@@ a , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences as he played among all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I ever felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices can bring in the locker room fresh wind , even if the messages are in tune with the predicted . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used at One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and for my part I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions will not be light @-@ heart@@ ed .
&quot; the Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = exit Britain from the EU ) could attract an allowance , if the economy has a floo@@ ding machine in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new@@ com@@ promising strategy to keep Britain in the EU , with every day deeper into difficulties , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who were fier@@ cely viol@@ ated to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplomacy emphasized that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ established agenda with ges@@ ting conc@@ essions and disturbing agreements , which they mostly do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , TU@@ C decided on its annual general meeting that it may not be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance minister climb to the summit , or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to last looking out in the interior of the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us know that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where there is no matter whether we remain or going . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s careful ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is one of the allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her , as it is bad for it , as it is going to be over the exagger@@ ated long out@@ har@@ ness like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ aming power .
&quot; Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left wing . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they are carried out a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy better for it , Scotland &apos;s resign@@ ation from the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar to separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore some such ministers may even plan un@@ inten@@ tionally not@@ ing comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s bank@@ roll campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , presum@@ ed my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a place , and &quot; Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how clean the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU Sk@@ ep@@ tic became the oligar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as it did not support our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember weak on Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who has established a name as an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
in all his mad@@ ness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
&quot; this was the med@@ ley of tax @-@ feared sc@@ ur@@ king , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the pseudo @-@ Indian countries , who own most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually , Tony Blair is similar to her , however , found that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage one gets better ban@@ anas in order to distr@@ act him instead of at his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the mili@@ ar was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ aner as he himself , as he was rejected Camer@@ ons as a referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened him a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never let him go .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly ch@@ aps on my back - I told him that he didn &apos;t want to waste time more for me - seems to repeat the boy@@ cot@@ ic boy@@ cott acy of the 80 @-@ he years , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I put it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps have a traditional blood tendency and the wil@@ der veins of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may everyone say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said , as the boy@@ sc@@ outs made in it , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow anc@@ ellor was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year years , when his old father urged to be ther@@ eu@@ pon , il@@ loyal towards his Labour cab@@ inet@@ bet , without losing too far and lose his cab@@ inet@@ ts@@ job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; stay in all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , still what J@@ C told his fellow members and members following all reports on their cl@@ ass@@ on on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching the bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n will - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline , remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the spiral of social media , a brood @-@ site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s correct to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allowed him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ ui@@ ties to the EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite sec@@ retariat , her anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left Dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ tism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ low@@ man convinced that J@@ C will not be campaign for leaving - will try to try foreign diplom@@ ats to find a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin hold political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when this can be anything po@@ int@@ less ?
&quot; the US has already been fairly disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start of the Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created out of a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , they said researchers . &quot;
experts who are writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined in The Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ ze the sur@@ names of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
p@@ he published the &quot; Mani@@ fes@@ sion Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the load@@ ability of data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; editorial purpose in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; , &quot; which p@@ ates its most important conclusion on the p@@ he . &quot;
two more researchers write about BM@@ J and asked whether to build the alleg@@ ations &quot; on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Safety and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expecting the asser@@ tion of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of references and modeling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ disciplinary decision analysis program ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to perform their opinions about the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine hal@@ low products ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose management had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study before . &quot;
he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report as they said .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he should have received by Philip Morris International according to reports before the Tab@@ ac@@ companies Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champion , some of which also specify industries financing in the paper . &quot;
several other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the session the tobacco was attended by p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; blo@@ ws &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a shortage of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , no of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ hic report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations of p@@ he said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and wellbeing with p@@ he said that BM@@ J has already been responded to the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life smo@@ ker dies in his addi@@ ction .
&quot; all evidence make sure that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the unique duty to inform the public about what is proof , and what is not , particularly when so much public confusion over relative haz@@ ards are compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die yearly in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national healthcare system two billion € per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear guidelines of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of claims that is caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former manager of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Riv@@ als would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows , as the Albert Square so@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio charge should be used only to make the type of programmes that are not sent by other UK broad@@ c@@ aster devices .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly considered public @-@ legal programmes which are probably seen from a smaller audience , in hard disp@@ uted time window for the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Direc@@ torate , Tony Hall , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations said Johnson , that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs could be commissioned or sends , which also clearly indicated by not subsidi@@ zing Riv@@ als , &quot; said Johnson &apos;s the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I consider in the medium or long term not for a good idea , one should at least do its production on programs that do not make others or do it . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a prime time window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise one would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course nonsense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give your right arm to this . &quot;
I am ti@@ ring to see how this is to be public @-@ friendly television .
I don &apos;t believe this would decrease the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term assistance . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC repeatedly give to what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Donald &apos;s speech in Edinburgh will be suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather openly official N@@ ischen program should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can rather see the audience , but they perform their functions and they may argue if they have done on their apparent missions for the justi@@ fication of 4 billion dollars , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ures programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where nobody ever wanted them to see .
&quot; for broad@@ cast@@ ers said Johnson to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ si@@ ves system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value below . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all , we think that one receives a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who is a lot of money for 150 £ a year , wonder whether this is true , because they consume not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check out its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to form and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it &apos;s 1 % of their TV Production and 0.1 % on the radio , and it should change on public @-@ legal TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the issue of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television can be shown , and to enter with the commercial real alliances in order to make all available online . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Son@@ ic@@ e@@ tics &quot; &quot; can control brain cells through sound waves . &quot;
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ cin@@ oma still change the direction in the moment , in which they can be denied with sound impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ cin@@ emat@@ ography change the direction in the moment , in which they have to be heard with sound impul@@ ses , which have heard for the human hearing for high frequencies , in order to be heard . &quot;
&quot; pul@@ ses are working through the switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ cells , which are modified gene@@ tically to wear the membrane channels , which respond to ultr@@ as@@ waves . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity using light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new trial , called son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , where ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the proceedings of one day could replace the depths of the brain , which indicates the brain &apos;s electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; traps usually do not react at ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani proved that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ w@@ job , he found out , reinforce the ultr@@ as@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced @-@ waves functions work on structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels , and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the thro@@ ws cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these deposits and activate the cells that are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ics TR@@ P @-@ 4 deposits . &quot;
&quot; when he uses ultr@@ as@@ ound dedicated to the changed creatures , the sound waves are transferred through the micro@@ organisms and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they changed the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to include neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ic@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that has to be sent to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , kidney @-@ conduc@@ tive tissues can happen and can be sent into the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the quoted human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signals in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insul@@ in @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rule for living in student dormit@@ ory
&quot; eleven years ago I went as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who have been angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I have learned , can be di@@ sti@@ lled within eight simple rules . &quot;
the flu@@ ent in student dormit@@ ory reaches from easily ner@@ ven@@ ing up to completely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sn@@ acking : people tell you wh@@ ence you come , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , there is only a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - place your questions and show interest .
&quot; it orchestr@@ ates the conversation and helps you to find the people you like , unlike those that you might not speak , even if your lashes were rub@@ b@@ ish into fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; the rooms of humans are often turning into drinks recipes , movies and night venues , and local meeting PO@@ IN@@ TS , but they are also places where people prefer to educate and destroy their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; according to this , do not think about connected to the university with a relationship . &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a crude treatment at the university .
&quot; her room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ stroll culture , which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this may be hell for somebody who is trying to rec@@ u@@ perate . &quot;
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship goes on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a cl@@ as@@ sm@@ ates is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send it an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos ! do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a non @-@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship reig@@ ned by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of back Man@@ ie , the monastery is beginning to imagine the doors of humans , to be imag@@ ining himself with a dish of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ cooked treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to entertain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
&quot; bad mixed l@@ ump from fl@@ our , sugar and fat lead to make people sleeping if you click . &quot;
food to ste@@ al is a common crime in student dormit@@ ory .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chickens is a theft , but is it Take a drop of milk for your tea even ? &quot;
review this with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say themselves to operate , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when somebody is ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate @-@ hostess , who added their milk a dishwasher , to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people off their sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a permanent human being , but that you are in the true sense of the verb to man who are in the glass building . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corrid@@ or asked her neighbors whether there was something to make them something , drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
you re@@ acted with even more popular music .
&quot; when they finally heard at 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neighbors still two hours before they left their own music , and shut their door and prepare for her three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would enter coinci@@ dentally in the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be aw@@ k@@ ward rather than once you hold a ro@@ ommate for your future sp@@ ouses , to turn to them and then experience it every day , and perhaps bring them along with all common friends too ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try to talk at least to talk a little reason at least . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has his keys in his not sle@@ epy room , the limit between an ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good strike is funny , but it only takes moments , until he becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place by ab@@ ide a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but fail you never use someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and shamp@@ oo .
&quot; close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you make then into the freezer - but pun@@ ches its pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; wareh@@ ouses for refugees , all @-@ cat@@ er@@ ted , t@@ ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the mid @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but just as single mothers and those who are ear@@ ing themselves . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how one can still build cheap and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for their homes .
the ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner : a lot of refugees will push for the living market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass of mass in containers or rotation does not have sustainability .
for people are staying in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we have sufficient living space in the next decades . &quot;
a very ban@@ ana tri@@ plex semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a house @-@ detached house needs the least square .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different from people living in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are precisely in the pilot project , consists of three units of residence for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is back peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , houses can be changed easily according to their respective needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is located at EUR 184 , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction has taken .
this is reasonable .
have the rules of construc@@ ting their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : in the right way I submitted my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always makes the dro@@ pping d@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ - special structure and the job @-@ space order .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; there is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a wh@@ ouses , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is missing the place .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update will be released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , click &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it &apos;s ready , the telephone gives you the option to download and then install Inst@@ all . &quot;
&quot; some are pushed after the installation to problems , as they get a error , which communic@@ ates that the &quot; &quot; software update has failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the issue , users are advised to either wait , until the rush goes back or trying to update over iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean the delet@@ ing of Apps , to create room - but Apple has made it easier to delete it when one uses a special tool to delete apps , and then install it new once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged while up@@ loaded , or is located near a char@@ ger , so the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; when the load is too low , Apple does not let the update be continued , as the telephone might be switched on half way and this might lead to a break@@ down of the updates . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice ri@@ oting and investing 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Ju@@ ste@@ ausen .
&quot; moreover , Sam@@ bur@@ gl@@ ank@@ ger@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Promotion in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country physicians - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , Dr. Frank Müller took over in practice on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ er enters into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing in his successor for the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a re @-@ phase phase Müller the practice will start again on October 12 until then it will invest 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises on the Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when the fields began for years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently graduated with their specialist education in the Under@@ standing hospital and will also get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage dump would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Ju@@ ste@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when it was , I have simply called them . &quot;
married Müller warned the idea of running its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patient are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to know and accompany the families through the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he will see his own boss soon . &quot;
and so one was common that the gar@@ bage bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in el@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller also grown up , his medical studies in Hanover followed the stations in several medical offices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he has been working as a wa@@ it@@ ary in Sul@@ ingen , in addition , he was appointed to the executive board in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is involved with volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness ven@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
as of September 19 the practice for the new principal will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ den@@ gh@@ ausen as a primary home she has specialised his spouse Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ship ) at the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both Inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle for themselves as home@@ actors . &quot;
&quot; consequently the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after re@@ modeling the rooms will look modern .
we are offering more ultr@@ as@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and res@@ ili@@ ent @-@ EK@@ GS and need an intercom function more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro get the gar@@ bage within a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continuing &quot; , &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ ises sen@@ sel@@ dom Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; around 2000 patients according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , in practice every quarter in practice , in the north @-@ German average practice , it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another home@@ op@@ ra@@ xis .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor could have found , it would have gone . &quot;
&quot; who is visiting gar@@ bage &apos;s drive , inci@@ dentally continues to look in trusted faces : takes over the seven medical journals and cleaning power from the fields of rock . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf ends a era , after all the medicine has practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Ju@@ se@@ ausen cru@@ ising . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness they feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we are still staying in Hohen@@ moor and many patients will surely see it often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; your husband is compl@@ em@@ ented : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed ahead of gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels via . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls will also be reached by our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Secretary of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upri@@ ght .
&quot; however , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum application , this can also be &quot; natural &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people is par@@ amount .
&quot; but it is clear that there was clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people must know that we don &apos;t accept bor@@ ou@@ trag@@ ically migration flows even from the Austrian @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; corrid@@ or &quot; - Slovenia has been denied
Croatian government had previously told that Slovenia would continue to leave Slovenia &apos;s coming refugees in Austria and Germany and under circumstances to build corrid@@ ors for refugees too .
&quot; so , this was the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corrid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia , rather , is the monitoring of the border - above all to Hungary - intensi@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled than the limit of the archipelago . &quot;
&quot; as the minister stressed , Slovenia wants to achieve its borders for refugees but not a abri@@ d@@ fish . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ um . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government w@@ edge , the first refugees would have already tried in the night hours for the night to so@@ ften the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to so@@ ak the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take place in the nearby ma@@ is@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik was ever meeting with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about sy@@ rer and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Maced@@ onian border , which has so far been transferred to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade ranks however , however , that it means that people are wise to hit certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do it , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , at least in the morning a first bus had arrived with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , over the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the companions were on the road all night , which was on the way around 500 kilometres distant &quot; &quot; ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has access , so the police have said that we should leave here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could now actually be a predicted shift to the previous Balkan Range in Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatian Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared for the fall of a strong state @-@ stream of refugees , for possible proportions of measures . &quot;
&quot; he did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia used as a non @-@ Schengen member of &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; since 2007 it has been part of the EU &apos;s EU partners since 2007 , a good record of what is concerned with the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on ser@@ b@@ arian side , behind the Hungarian border border , some 300 refugees continue to be found . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they would have gone the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border entr@@ ances of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees trying to reach the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic had tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local point in horror , he stop the debates on Altern@@ atives Rou@@ tes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast . &quot;
it would not currently be a very high level of refugees .
&quot; we could not tell if they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
aid rates migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute country cards on which alternative routes are shown through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in sections of the bor@@ derland , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian case still not tidy min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ de@@ mining was sent in the border region .

the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice made attention with this action to its 20 year anniversary and is thoroughly faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went in the midst of the action into the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer . &quot;
the director of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice is available for pas@@ sers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like volunteers .
&quot; while some a Pass@@ ant is spontaneous to the circle , and read the phrase around &quot; My life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; with the camper gone by the USA , &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; or &quot; not long . &quot; &quot; continue reading , read phrases as &quot; &quot; so far I am not &quot; &quot; and then go further . &quot;
&quot; again and again the si@@ delines have been developing small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on site .

therefore the public offer effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
&quot; that not everybody wants to share openly with the tablets , but it is understandable , after all it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying have still ha@@ sted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer , even the hosp@@ ice movement has contributed much to the last few years that men open . &quot;

&quot; by personal experiencing with the topic , it read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice is called for volunteer , she immediately reported immediately and was involved in the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in the hosp@@ ice San@@ kt Vincent . &quot;
all are them carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can be done well with their purpose and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another warning , I consider it precious and este@@ emed the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient eco @-@ service service is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
&quot; the financial support of health insurance and donations of relatives and associations enable the training , as well as further training and super@@ visor of dying and supporters . &quot;

but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales in ground transport increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was generally flat due to higher cost for larger packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit distri@@ butes higher income due to higher rates , while the result for higher labour costs in the freight @-@ shop sank . &quot;
&quot; trade market , approximately one hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares by 3.8 billion , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent by record high on 11 June .
&quot; on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve G@@ at@@ egen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ onian table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the track for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; liquid on them at an end of the supplied , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seating capacity is a m@@ ural on the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues want to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing US occupation and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the large recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ protected third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct them . it is announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets are already cau@@ tious , this vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest in federal funding - and be it just about one quarter point of percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labor market and inflation primarily will be the most important what they are watching , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ical in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were searching for a pre@@ text , the interest rate did not increase , increased uncertainty about the global market enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do is with@@ hold of itself the financial market .
&quot; about half the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed from Bloomberg Jo@@ in , have predicted that week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets are expecting a decrease of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of increasing . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the pen@@ ers decreased the blow by lowering the pl@@ edge that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage worth around 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action has been triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at this time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; would have to go very far in their explanation to put the financial markets into panic so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest rate was soothing the financial markets because they would be in@@ security about when the F@@ ed act would eliminate .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed was on good ways to increase the sentence by side@@ ways in this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of mon@@ et@@ ting conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer , despite the complaints of Liber@@ als that would be more economic progress , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement in the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank to 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level , which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
pay@@ k@@ ets have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation ran steadily under the end goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist in Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world witnessed at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was worth more than 16 % under its peak , as investors feared that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would increase global growth . &quot;
&quot; this month , the market has recovered something this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now at almost 10 % below the du@@ ke of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market uph@@ e@@ av@@ al influence the complex calculation , when you should raise the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of Chinese economy has not occurred in the past few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US staff . &quot;
&quot; now he predicted that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better . &quot;
&quot; there are a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main objective of the F@@ ed , which is why it should not be involved in making its decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed monetary authority of the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere reference of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be their mon@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; b@@ ony conf@@ usions about the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly popular with each other , the F@@ ed representatives may not only monitor the developments in another place , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; your decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ech@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to finance market movements , which seems to be linked with the commercial fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , the particip@@ atory member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to an interest rate , in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark to lower percentage points in three sessions , despite more limited impact on growth in the US . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed represent@@ ations made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the most recent turbul@@ ence are not coming near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate , because the markets increased , &quot; P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hur@@ ry the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
welcome to your self @-@ warm welcome is not without the engagement of a volunteer assistant .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
among them belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also with their 74 L@@ enzen she teaches us still .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seeker on the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ distan , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the quite different teaching is at the right school . &quot;
Brazilian society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian organization SP@@ RS is trying to educate women about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted on br@@ ushes , which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies need to give all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get out to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only theoretical adaptation to the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protect them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can have a negative impact . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the Council of Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euros in expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat@@ ter for solar flat@@ ter .
the planning for the long @-@ driven turn@@ ech@@ ation at Bern@@ rie@@ der sports premises come step by step ahead : in the latest community meeting the construction works without great discussions was en@@ visi@@ oned .
&quot; in other words , the Panel had already decided to submit a request to a new legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; of valid trial plan . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the attic . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof must be built with no @-@ occasionally First and Dach@@ stein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the prescribed use of the roof surface for solar power plants : &quot; this is why we get together a wonderfully large South dd@@ ach , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; liberation &quot; in turn , it was about the roof pitch , which is due for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore needed because of the development plan on the roof pitch no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the B@@ oph@@ ile of the Council of the Council of Justice is rather more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however , during the rotation of the gym , however , this is no recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the sports hall at the sports centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
there are some 2.3 million euros at the cost of about 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots promotion .
&quot; in the next stage of the procedure , the construction contract for the 18 x 36 meters wide hall is now presented to the rate and the inspection area . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed sooner than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; simultaneously , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become a new doctor of doctor in the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the station , as well as the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
these look at the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Land@@ circle before the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
&quot; but a decision on this is the Super@@ visory Board , and the conven@@ es on the coming Wednesday , 23 . September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority of soldiers with fishermen and the further existing interior can move to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the employees who cannot talk to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a place in Wei@@ l@@ heim , then Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the staff are informed about the plans .
&quot; triggered the change of cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been managing medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the beginning and now has changed a private practice in direct proximity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is supposed to compete , came to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game , who agreed to take over leadership from 1 October and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au pre@@ y this in every case a &quot; upgrading &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area &quot; Intern@@ al medicine &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
fishermen is specialised for cardi@@ op@@ makers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
&quot; in completion for the next two years F@@ isher is supposed to agree with his team , when the Super@@ visory Board will guide to the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ end , until next year the former hospital in the Kn@@ app@@ end@@ berg , which is still final in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to nearly 140 years will be final . &quot;
&quot; so far , the County had planned this for 2018 , if the ongoing renovation in the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; advis@@ es Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Super@@ visory Board , has resign@@ ed to what the house , which is owned by the federal government , in future will be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; so I fell asleep . as it went with the property , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White did not say , I give several refl@@ ections . &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a Res@@ pir@@ ated chi@@ atri@@ cs .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an occasion will not come back , &quot; &quot; Fischer over the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been positive and very understanding from the staff . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , has been working in the Fischer for over 30 years , did not have it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer pe@@ er to take the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was always threatened over recent decades in recent decades , departments were shut down , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ held of the Rhein @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are now called evening ( 20.@@ 30h ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight .
&quot; the tab@@ ular leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , the clear favorite , reason for the excess is however no one . &quot;
in the last season the Bad@@ ener saw a sore defeat in the last season and have something crazy .
hunting attack with two in@@ ju@@ red at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely in@@ ju@@ red during their corn crop on Tuesday morning .
&quot; during the Aber@@ en@@ tens at a cor@@ n@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police w@@ edge . &quot;
&quot; after an admission , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals . &quot;
how exactly it could happen to the accident was unclear .
the crime @-@ police was determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence
a Tat@@ suspic@@ ious has led the police for the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ ni@@ r of the 20 year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one since Saturday missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a crime break into the victim .
&quot; the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday night in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ too , one also applies at the service evening of twenty @-@ year @-@ old who put in fact the indication , and the investig@@ ators lead to the locality of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had already been reported on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to a autumn fixed in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to the autumn .
in Search of the young woman the investig@@ ators first came to personal items of the victim .
&quot; in survey in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the persec@@ utions , a result eventually revealed a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the mut@@ t perpet@@ r@@ ator carried the police into a channel in rock enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
the ban@@ ker was adopted by the authorities in the police officers and the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been killed and the cor@@ ks placed in the canal .
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday to the harbour at the harbour , the investig@@ ators lay out the w@@ schlag to the burden . &quot;
evidence on the closer circumstances of action shall bring the further investigation .
refugees need accommodations : study on the mor@@ row
the location on the German market market is tense .
there are also more and more refugees trying for a pay@@ able lead .
the pressure on the living @-@ market is growing .
the social housing building faces a challenge .
the market @-@ competitions on the German market market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
it will compete with one @-@ weak citizens around the last paid apartments .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , more than 8@@ 0,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; on this result , a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; means of housing . &quot;
&quot; by comparison , this year Germany are 26@@ 0,000 units finished . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there are already 14@@ 0,000 flats . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees can no longer be pl@@ edged to live as asylum seek@@ ers at an initial accommodation . &quot;
many then come across the living @-@ market and are in the long queu@@ es before the rent apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Chanc@@ ellery , however , last year remained less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers to rent . &quot;
but the negative trend of the residential market is not only due to the increasing refugee pay .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policies of the past few years .
Germany Shi@@ pped a housing deficit in front of itself that gets bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently , in the metropolitan areas were already around 77@@ 0,000 flats , with Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals were therefore not@@ ated in big cities in W@@ G @-@ rooms .
&quot; young adults stayed un@@ voluntary in the &quot; &quot; hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; because of the Fl@@ utes on the living @-@ market un@@ voluntarily longer in &quot; &quot; hotel Mama . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in the last few years has dropped for the first time . &quot;
&quot; to resolve the issue , the alliance &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; proposes a restart . &quot;
this will boost new incentives to the social housing construction again .
&quot; this way could be given to the annual report tax , and the basic tax for funded apartments could be fixed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the alliance is attractive to le@@ ased up@@ setting options . &quot;
the funding Programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the state bank K@@ f@@ W is working well in cities and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start was announced at the assembly line with 184 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be extended . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia to Cor@@ rid@@ or
&quot; after Hungary , there is practically no going to go through , there more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to grant the trip to Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but this route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to go along with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corrid@@ or for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the secretary of the secretary , and when it is necessary we will organize a corrid@@ or , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen passport .
&quot; after the descent of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees to Croatia were dis@@ cour@@ aged to get there from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik reported the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had taken its border on refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws that occurred the same day into force , make the neat asylum process in Hungary practically super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , it is women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but they are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took place on the morning the first refugees at the Serbia &apos;s border to the EU @-@ neighboring Croatia .
&quot; most of the gen@@ dered media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and a taxi in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk on foot over the green border to Croatia .
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach the border . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the border stri@@ ves other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ de@@ mining is now to result in a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , on the closing of the border far more refugees arrive . &quot;
on Tuesday the police attacked the police of 36@@ 6 people .
shortly before the trail on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws are overcoming the border and damage of the Grenz@@ za@@ us .
in the southern Hungarian border city Sz@@ eged will therefore have 35 criminal proceedings initiated .
condemned to five years and ex@@ tradition from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration office one went on Tuesday in the newly at the border &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sessions &quot; &quot; altogether , almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
on the Wednesday morning there were 40 res@@ ett@@ led refugees there .
&quot; however , no one has no more prospect than to get asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to indi@@ an opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the deriv@@ ative asylum seek@@ ers should be brought up there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to escape .
they gathered the tr@@ ash that left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
black@@ lock@@ ers were eliminated and one of the cav@@ ity in the bor@@ ort was rebuilt .
to the goal of this re@@ building no one wanted to express itself .
Austria may be reached after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; about the 20,000 migrants stood after the period of government , but they were still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg about 1400 people waiting for the continuing drive to Germany .
the move from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the request of the German authorities .
there are regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot in Fre@@ man@@ ass@@ ing .
Mayor went &quot; A@@ tr@@ and@@ ete &quot; over the border
&quot; we were firmly focused on Sunday evening with o@@ fr@@ aming , when suddenly ten people were occupied by travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ n Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had dis@@ continued with Austria on Sunday but because of the refugee flow to Austria , the Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and had ch@@ opped his cars on the border to the border of Pass@@ au . &quot;
previously we did not res@@ ett@@ led guests only once again , with J@@ ause and drink . &quot;
we have said it straight away ; we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; as the patron of O@@ ÖN conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this has always been very happy , &quot; the patron of the city . &quot;
&quot; the wag@@ ering entries had risen on Sunday evening in Wels by a ICE in a regional direction of Pass@@ au , to have ce@@ ased it after the short @-@ term pro@@ cl@@ amation that the traffic traffic to Germany was set to Germany , but still the border to try . &quot;
but the regional train was completed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Bav@@ arian @-@ festival association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday , Sundays before a two @-@ brid@@ ge@@ tic spor@@ ty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; now that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án have now send another ho@@ ists to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing holy policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the stock of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor , our Federal Chancellor , officially , officially laid out the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dark leadership of National Socialism . &quot;
trag@@ ically @-@ supporting these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the bor@@ derland with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; the refugee will have to find that &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the persistent refugee streams and the approaching winter , with us to establish decent @-@ standing conditions for protection . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 hibernation deer
Konrad has completed all hands full of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to give his word weight .
the government has inserted the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to initiate quot@@ ations for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; Konrad , the chaos in the first @-@ war @-@ centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees that came into Austria on Monday came out without great ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the State Department talked about them from a &quot; &quot; cr@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; overall , Konrad expects a need for 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ks in the he@@ ur@@ ry year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number you have to be found in the next weeks even 3@@ 5,000 accommodations - 20,000 people provide buyers , 15,000 the covenant . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a pass without the floor , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already done talks with the state of the state .
these would have added to it even for the coming refugees quot@@ as .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Scho@@ born , it is to be clari@@ fied as the church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations of the asylum coordin@@ ator continues into the OR@@ F promotion , as we do . &quot;
the platform can provide private and un@@ complicated accommodations .
&quot; in addition , one hopes to get to hotels that are empty during the winter . &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in case of emergency , it could not be that quot@@ as will have to respect a certain amount of hand@@ ch@@ ellers or size to the light . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; ambulance &quot; &quot; apply . &quot;
&quot; reveals that he is successful in contrast to the Interior Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Konrad , based on his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , who you cannot say without any further face of the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness be his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause costs as they said .
their number of employees want to increase her on three to four years .
the search results was not yet successful .
Konrad did want to exhibit a container at the square Steph@@ an@@ splatz in office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; first , there is not an opening of urban sports and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees , the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; if this is not necessary , because people cannot sub@@ ordinate them under these measures now , says Mayor of Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
but more locations are to be tested for emergency purposes .
criticism of the manager of the division of refugees within the state .
other districts must also contribute their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; Bor@@ ders are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) and the governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further procedures in the refugee deal .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
continued man@@ agements of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there is now the appropriate limit check@@ ers . &quot;
special trains with refugees to Germany will never pret@@ end no more .
but the searches were however associated with regulatory trains .
from the other EU Member States called for increased solidarity in the refugee deal .
&quot; that now Austria goes again at its border control , is a logical consequence of &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the &quot; &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; by the &quot; &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; is officially finished . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the company &apos;s IT group is drawn to group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is intended to be rented to young , innovative businesses from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up @-@ companies of the New ship@@ yard and later what to act .
right from the start I want to collaborate with the new neighbours - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot . &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time .
&quot; 1.7 million Euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.2 million Euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city Linz , the Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is greatly desp@@ ised by Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square metres in the building are rented apartments , for a further 40 percent there are inquiries . &quot;
lia @-@ Per@@ oni &apos;s owner opened a second shop in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la Hand@@ ckets are at the centre of attention .
&quot; actually , the Jut@@ ta wanted to establish a dog . &quot;
this project had to move the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ Market Arctic short stop : finally she has now gained shelter in the form of another business location .
&quot; in the Fur@@ la store in front of the business in which they sold among other things bags , suitcases , shoes and fabrics of different manufacturers now , all about Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger po@@ ckets and accessories costs up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop has been in operation .
previously several weeks has been changed .
&quot; but I have done a long time if I want to open a shop again , &quot; &quot; says broadly . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a dedicated office , where only their hand@@ bags are sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the One in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been wide laid by her mother in the cradle .
it seems most if something worked out and I can show new trends in high @-@ performance prizes .
why some woman should be on the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in tin @-@ cleaning and also the professional woman can not answer with the last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag has generated each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fal@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called .
&quot; this property also combines man@@ ders with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always off @-@ off .
&quot; whether he is expressed in foreign @-@ hos@@ tile , journalists or scientific gaps in the international crisis policy - the applicant candidate for the US presidential office will give rise to the voting fight . &quot;
and cuts well with them .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the real estate hol@@ s . &quot;
the New Yorker with the tram @-@ term is a concept many in the win@@ n@@ dorf on the wine @-@ road .
maneu@@ ver in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about their goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow you find it somehow fascinating , but in their k@@ all@@ ean species is not as deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous ski kids guys filmed with Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp who is not known to mod@@ est@@ y comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; to the king of the heart , he has not brought it there . &quot;
&quot; though it give respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to give the opinion that Tru@@ mp is a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - too high German : the offers , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus coming from the village of the Offer .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 when the later grandfather was emig@@ rated and opened in the USA a pub for the min@@ er .
found@@ ational of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy : her desire to return for a long time to return to the Bav@@ arian State , which was belonged to the Pfalz at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once rejected without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and Folklore , Roland Paul , were explained to film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
it stands in contrast to the sometimes multi @-@ key statements of the follow @-@ up .
he had repeated repeated revers@@ ed over Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to det@@ er illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ ish is not that sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives ( &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the Opa was born @-@ Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so dis@@ burns . &quot;
believes that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz performed for visiting something for the church organ , which generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; this can I not imagine of Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they pret@@ end it better if he did not get the choice , for &quot; he has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been s@@ cour@@ aged in the USA during the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite the attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra , to report in connection to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but it has no major shifting d@@ ations with the reviews for today . &quot;
&quot; the breakfast show of N@@ ine was aired by the Federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Saman@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ra , woke in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows that also belong to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the rebellion seemed to play no part for Australian TV spect@@ ators , since Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spect@@ ators in the five capitals , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in relation to the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last few months the gap to Sun@@ rise was closed .
&quot; in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18.@@ 000 compared to the 3@@ 30.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the distance between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September sunrise , at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spect@@ ators are at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at today . &quot;
this is the most interesting what happened every morning .
the winds of change concern these hours more than the Parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently we@@ ath@@ ered father , which ent@@ ails himself to settle in with his two children on the New Zealand , reached an impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &apos; yes .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven was strong with 1.9 million spect@@ ators and sm@@ ote The Block ( 8@@ 38.@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 pm ) of the new tri@@ via show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e revealed in an average of 44@@ 6,000 spect@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 hr to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang up to 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
&quot; the last evening was obtained the first half hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 audience and in the second half hour s@@ atte 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
hot @-@ Seat average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ SE@@ AT will finally be reached at 5 : 30 pm .

the last three are in line : Bachelor &apos;s Sam is the perfect man - but whom will he vote ?
secret to be revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may obviously un@@ mistak@@ ingly apparent who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood continues in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was wrapped in the greatest secret . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three , you possibly have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who the winner will be . &quot;
Sam Wood continues to seal his lips up to the finals on Thursday .
&quot; all three women forgot about it in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and familiar with his sense of hum@@ our , honesty , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should obtain the last rose ? &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the kill@@ ers who won the heart of the tor@@ rent . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki n@@ ited both quickly - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with one another from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ eh were re@@ marked , as I noticed that they were pretty compatible and I thought it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the correct chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam is well suited as a pair .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the &quot; &quot; visit last week &quot; &quot; made her clear that the Wood could be &quot; &quot; the One . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now de@@ duc@@ tible on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , to elect to elect , when not they , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left wing girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s is on Wednesday , 19 : 30 pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle were great interest in moving to the United States - and many other teams , which were sent to an impressive performance date by the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
&quot; some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank , when he lost a bar@@ ker like the Aussie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday in the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ as@@ ula tru@@ te his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a hunt @-@ return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ as@@ ula continues to prove its true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of having his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , encouraged them to ma@@ hlen . &quot;
Tom@@ as@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne on his press conference after the game in his press conference .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who wanted to forget his twi@@ sted mu@@ zzle and to take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t was restored with a p@@ unt , who was restored in the first game of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; certainly it was not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian tour had hop@@ ed for his NF@@ L debut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and was later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse start to his NF@@ L career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne postponed the car@@ vers with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

the main routine of the free voters acqu@@ ered by Friday in the Frank@@ ish Comm@@ une .
actually very different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free voters @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum from the cl@@ auses , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger asked for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the Yugoslavia war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
un@@ solic@@ ited asylum seek@@ ers want to postp@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administration of administration , who are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ actors , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
the F@@ W @-@ chief cri@@ tici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder is not consistent : &quot; we are nation@@ wide nation@@ wide standards of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; Bavaria p@@ ushes , others not . &quot;
&quot; then , we need to be able to act . &quot;

but that does not go far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want .
free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .

&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rub@@ ber@@ ing @-@ stories , known by them that they can kill them but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently such high death rate produced . &quot;
&quot; the examination was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal as the southern layer , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces would be built within the proposed new constitution to influence their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were carried out in violent conflicts since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; in August killed , when the four big political parties signed an agreement , divided the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally located for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution since 2008 has been on its way , but the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors accelerated the process following the devast@@ ating earthqu@@ akes that had killed in April thousands of people . &quot;
&quot; the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional &apos;s in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the land at the Em@@ mer@@ Youth Centre Alte Post is supposed to be built again .
the city is currently preparing for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; there is a mix of trade , commercial and living - concrete offers are still not planned . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town Em@@ den wants to market some 4,000 square meters large plot in direct vicinity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently running .
&quot; the premises are planned for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; you wait for the appropriate offers , it is part of the city . &quot;
&quot; which investor @-@ demand come , be not yet clear . &quot;

project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planners to holiday homes at the low sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor was presented publicly for the first time for the project .
many sub@@ lieg@@ er are more disturbing - they fear the selling of their am@@ usement park
&quot; once a monthly doors was di@@ aled , du@@ sted , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new cottage settlement at the low sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ esting , the mid @-@ scale embl@@ em of the Company &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Stadt@@ developer Committee of the Em@@ u . &quot;
it was initially temp@@ ted to that point on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , the Ralf convinced by the investors and the administration of intelligence , we went by Ralf B@@ ehr@@ enbach of the System @-@ Bau @-@ management in the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the members of the Council and over 50 visitors . &quot;
yet it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
the project has ten to twelve million Euros expensive projects has been in the discussion for months .
&quot; fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners who had come into the meeting were called for the images and new details to the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and a member of the representatives of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; that will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ z , who st@@ ained all other prayer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he feared as many other project critic , that the traffic would be heavily corro@@ bor@@ ated by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; there you have to come all bus lad@@ ders , so that expects that &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the good one acre area of the former host centre , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; only we must have a conclusi@@ ve concept , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ era . &quot;
because this even failed because the development plans were still variable .

Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations in his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul than she was seven years of age , her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , Dur@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants in Europe grew up , many people like my family des@@ per@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; the funds go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;

for easy overweight di@@ abe@@ tics may be useful for weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people living along with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who do non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death @-@ dates require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an article to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of stomach . &quot;
you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
&quot; over the years in obesity the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes have been proven efficiently , but most studies were carried out in people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a body @-@ Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BMI of 25 or more shows that somebody is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot;
you can here your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and stomach breast cancer for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BMI among those , under@@ gone this operation , sun@@ k from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BMI between those who have non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were received approximately the same at 29 . &quot;
&quot; under those who under@@ subjected itself surgical procedure , it reaches 36 % the diabetes illness completely and in 28 % part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is completely solved only at one percent and in part by only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monit@@ orable the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept by 7 percent by writing the researchers .
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at roughly 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , thus the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also uses average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost greater weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , increased set@@ backs in BMI ( 7,@@ 4 against 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 % vs. 2.7 % ) and reported rather a complete exit of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is indications made from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was under@@ estimated in obes@@ e individuals who have under@@ gone a obesity surgery , 29 percent less likely throughout the course of 15 years - compared to a group which tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for the survival with the surgery , Black@@ stone said , it is soothing for persons with a BMI among 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love @-@ History in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is a topic that spends more observ@@ ance at present in fiction : a young woman who is in@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the warm of her youth after years and he fell in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently created novel &quot; &quot; actually , we are not so &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ re reader , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main occupational writer was born in Lang@@ s and is pleased that she was able to place a liter@@ ary monument from her home town .
it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot take into all of the refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to refugee crisis in the Middle East remain . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called for an end to the violence in the countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford to be dedicated to ethics studies .
he requested that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of the West European countries to the refugee crisis ad@@ mired , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts at managing the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a real peace and genuine development , primarily by education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
ultimately we must think about how the kill@@ ings in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and introduced that the violent response from the US has moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 I have expressed my secretary to a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the road to resol@@ ving this problem lies in violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence and this has found unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand sani@@ ti@@ zer by children over the past 4 years
&quot; in the United States , Gi@@ ft@@ Control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 @-@ process increase in the number of children under 12 years , which sw@@ allow alcoholic hand sani@@ ti@@ zer to Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of inf@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , will report from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ iny in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants have to drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have said to be dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alco@@ hol@@ low m@@ outh@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be covered by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ap@@ ed .
&quot; there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , wine @-@ grapes and orange pe@@ aked , which are very pleas@@ ing for children . &quot;
ret@@ ou@@ ter@@ ous remedies contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children can lead a few sp@@ lash for alcohol @-@ po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly focused , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison center and the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Channel Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let whis@@ ky whis@@ ky go around , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and if children come from it , then there is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lash of after straw@@ berry as well as in school , was brought into an emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is widely drunk with an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical practitioner , which treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ eth their words and was not able to walk , when she arrived in the emergency . &quot;
&quot; doctors cast them overnight in a separate children &apos;s house at an indication of mill@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and turned out to the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez is recommended for parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol @-@ toxic@@ ation out there were several dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants connected to deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the fri@@ gh@@ ing of hand sani@@ ti@@ zer , which contains a toxic , not dedicated ingredient . &quot;
&quot; staff of health authorities suggest that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ anol as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January as planned three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; &quot; teachers &quot; , &quot; organized by bacterial products around the lessons , so it is a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly @-@ allergic against hand sani@@ ti@@ zer and ex@@ iles them out of their room .
the police considered the negotiated Plan as &quot; W@@ aters &quot; and dismis@@ sed a disciplinary action to the local authorities .

the lack of title competition in the Scottish football @-@ bor@@ ed defe@@ ats - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er told that Dutch fans has lost interest in Celtic people since there are no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland you show no highlights at Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people are talking about not just about the return of the R@@ angers .
you speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they are talking about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there are a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I am going to revol@@ ve things off . I am distr@@ acted Dei@@ la .
&quot; Ronn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic fight has to fight , but the Norwegian boss sh@@ red@@ or to turn things around . &quot;

&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating , and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly so - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need to get the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
all together is so important .

why I will be the witness of a Soviet revolution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a bit later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will be able to see how a man is put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a audience gallery in the Death Chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sip is reflected by the Gi@@ ft@@ sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation was made first in January through his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day comes closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see devices in the United States , and there are often more applicants working as places available , find a mak@@ ab@@ normal lot@@ tery instead of deciding who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who will be selected will be watching it emotional .
I cannot .
&quot; I will sit beside Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest boyfriend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be permitted to take a not@@ ebook and a pen , to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving me Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will receive access . &quot;
I describe myself with her .
&quot; it l@@ ures it that &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she is still thinking that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had trouble with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
yet he wants that an international re@@ por@@ ter is present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations is to help the movement against death penalty . &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ viewer of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I will not go here again for all details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong probability exists that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters that you can contact for .
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it says that a man will die of the necessary death . &quot;
&quot; to speak to a hum@@ id police persec@@ uted , from the C@@ anning River &quot;
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry as he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; attemp@@ ting a man of Per@@ th , to turn off the police was un@@ successful , when he was in sei@@ zing and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters away from a police officers , the tried to move &quot; him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was declared on Tuesday to a domestic attack in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; as they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; I am not coming out , come and take me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Sal@@ lan per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his Uni@@ form wet , so he turned a reliable tactics - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things around trying to escape , &quot; said Senior S@@ ant Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
Master @-@ soccer player Ben Cous@@ in offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 I went to his car in the dit@@ ch , to escape an alcohol control and then tried to float over the Swan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired local to the humor@@ ous plan of a Ben Cous@@ in Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moody claimed that ste@@ wards sought to sp@@ y him and dispute the racing sport
&quot; Peter Moody claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables , last year , and dro@@ wned the race immediately . &quot;
he quoted on the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ated Department of Racing Victoria and suggested that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for one of the racing day treatment , the last St@@ roh@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing , and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt con@@ et@@ asting at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ation and did not want it to be &quot; out &quot; as too high hanging grapes .
&quot; I had before , nothing to say about it and I have been looking for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything on once gets out , &quot; Moody &quot;
they know they are ongoing .
&quot; sometimes it is respon@@ sive , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to visit the main point , and I want my owners think I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they begin to think , I do not do it , then I should not be any more coach . &quot;
&quot; I have to think carefully , what I do with my license . &quot;
&quot; previously , Moody got the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the terms of the integration department had tried to sp@@ y his stable foot@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - I will say when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly summ@@ arize themselves to their n@@ oses , because she is trying to sum@@ mar@@ ise me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ y , acting President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of that time and are still today . &quot;
should I believe that it will be personal ?
&quot; follow Route L lou@@ dly , and maybe people are responsible outside the trainer of what is going on in the branch ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and stum@@ ble me ; and I have no doubt that what I am saying , they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; now I have arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ ity levels of the coach have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation by Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate scrap@@ ing led to that he could throw his license about the table .
&quot; Moody , best known by his preparation for the un@@ interrupted Masters Black C@@ avi@@ ar , drew the race track treatment rule , after having been applied to a pack of mud or sound on the horse , which came against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mist@@ aken , mud on the ball . &quot;
it could have been yesterday evening so .
in yesterday it could have been the whole day so what was so .
but it did so on the race day .
Moody could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who impose these rules , don &apos;t know anything about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; Moody &quot;
man after Dri@@ urs@@ ed arrested
on the weekend the police took a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent lane in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was supplied with the helicop@@ ter into the Royal Melbourne hospital with heavy injuries after being hit by car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley .
&quot; the police said , the driver continued to drive , without stop to help the wounded driver . &quot;
on Monday a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia of the Police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
it is expected to be charged on ground@@ ed and lower aid har@@ ass@@ ing and due to other traffic difficulties .

Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy go back against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations of Ring@@ eling
Melbourne @-@ Stor@@ m @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has awarded critics by the Tac@@ as its player as an &quot; agenda Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League favor@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have allowed the Stor@@ m @-@ players to join his team during the high Stor@@ m winner in the qualifying session in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little vei@@ led note to the Stor@@ m team , after his team had scored the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ff example &quot; &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two are not &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; in the R@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew , and said that she is only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coach at his team did him feel confident , because it &apos;s pre@@ y that they were worried about being be@@ aten from the Stor@@ m team . &quot;
&quot; this always emerg@@ es - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson over ring@@ struggles spoke , when she pressed us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bar@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed at our defensive system or the techniques all year round , but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real centre of attention and that is provided for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s been funny just how this time it rises to this season .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea away from the &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and remember his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a pr@@ one . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , which you want to play if you have these kinds of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so that they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I would be more confident because they are saying these things , because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was the big Games .
&quot; Bell@@ amy , also pointed out that the game of Stor@@ m against Roo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the outcome ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks make and do not have a point of cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the schedu@@ les .
&quot; when they relate to us , it means that we will meet in a phase still on them . &quot;
&quot; the Stor@@ m team has free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boy or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AMI &apos;s National Park . ticket sales begin on the next Saturday morning . &quot;
Ser@@ ber with $ 200,000 deposit to drug for@@ age
&quot; a man who may possibly have a lifetime punishment threatened because of his su@@ cks , into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were floo@@ ded to Queensland , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month , after the police force was arrested 100 kg in the drug at the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the course of the morning and later in Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police met 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially viable sentence for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole host and that there might have been a harmless reason in the café . &quot;
&quot; the judge of the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter F@@ agan , was worried about the danger of the flood at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he stated to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the case of a criminal case he put the police about his place of residence .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and st@@ ep@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the fi@@ dav@@ its explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of $ 200,000 Dollar is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge F@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent it from it , not to appear , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security , under the conditions that he ob@@ serves his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , at the police open every day and to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
an accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : leader goes apart
&quot; at a dri@@ v@@ eway with three trucks , on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been severely in@@ ju@@ red on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three participating lor@@ ries had broken down before a permanent place in direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noted it too late and tried in vain , at the last moment to turn to the left as the police officers . &quot;
the tran@@ se@@ er of the in@@ quired plan entirely apart .
the driver has been seriously har@@ med in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked up over six hours to 2 PM .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone by girls to enti@@ er P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile to the end of pictures
one pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of a 11 year old girl in order to request images of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , log@@ st@@ amped in an online sc@@ aging service , from which he received a number of unknown images of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleep H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confusing message and al@@ armed immediately their mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care about and saw the five pictures , analytical then computer , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; websites of research , the terms used for the search for dis@@ continued pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g said then to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile on the internet &quot; &quot; and then he &apos; gave a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor of E@@ ili@@ dh Robert@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a addi@@ ction that he addi@@ c@@ ted to sc@@ are men . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the addi@@ ctions were carried on the computer by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are a girl . &quot;
&quot; he was asked following his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked him to send more photos . &quot;
he said that he did it to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he is sick in the head , if he dro@@ wns , and said , he wants to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robert@@ son added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ m@@ bling and in the we@@ eping . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and made the def@@ endants with it .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused &apos;s computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girl , which saw much younger than he did . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , guilty ple@@ aded in the sense of indic@@ t@@ ment to ban in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year and not to be tried before court hearing on 24 March of that year . &quot;
&quot; the Defence Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual offen@@ ders , as we argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; can be found in his trans@@ gres@@ sions . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael bl@@ ouse the judgment until October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was not permitted in this case , but was held in custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other cases in custo@@ dy . &quot;
it was added to the date of the ruling in the directory of sexual criminal off@@ ences .
Sch@@ le@@ user differ from small border entr@@ ances to Germany from
more and more refugees will be picked up away from the Austrian border crossing at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many s@@ le@@ user were made out of fear of discovery and fix people multip@@ lied with smaller borders
&quot; in the Austrian page , there was a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police . &quot;
along the border river Inn were picked up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees .
they were walking on bridges and g@@ ather@@ land on the German side .
there they are taken in reception by Bundes@@ poli@@ cists and referred to registration .
the Zurich main railway station met more and more refugees from Germany at Munich Stock Exchange compared to the weekend starts .
&quot; only until 8@@ am , around 700 people be arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
following the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border had reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees .
Stuttgart : departure from Tro@@ pic@@ stur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the South@@ west
mete@@ or@@ ologists were suggested in the southwest of the Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; because of a deep @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , our current marine litter at the country , divided into the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart with a view . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous t@@ ief is the &quot; &quot; sti@@ ff &quot; &quot; of the Tro@@ pics &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; that attracted over the Atlantic in the last days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
fierce storms and Thunder@@ storms are expected primarily in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning there is also still in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b Al@@ b and in the Lake @-@ sea @-@ circle with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 h kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , there can be no longer looking for the sun again . &quot;
the mass does &apos; s : every two years the high@@ s at the I@@ AA demonstrate its innovations .
2015 is mainly due to the compact car vehicles that are currently particularly well selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were falling according to the Federal Chanc@@ ellery ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( Public Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new upper grades , and luxury cars are presented in this year , especially a lot of new compact models . &quot;
&quot; one of the greatest premi@@ eres for the German auto industry is the Opel Astr@@ a , which will be available in the fall of the deal@@ er@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; the Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; with this the volume model is also well sold , the new Astr@@ a is also to become much more expensive for it . &quot;
&quot; Opel is situated below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
&quot; the current Astr@@ a costs from 16 990 € . &quot;
the Astr@@ a is available with a new 1,4 @-@ lit@@ re engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offer more diesel fuel and petrol engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 HP , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gas@@ oline can be counted . &quot;
&quot; unlike most of the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astr@@ a is for the Opel Astr@@ a as a five @-@ fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , who is already shown on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will be up to the Astr@@ a on the I@@ AA to new compact cars ?
&quot; Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault , sends the fourth generation of his Astr@@ a competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race . &quot;
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively visible in a conventional and an stressed sports GT version .
&quot; in the beginning of next year , he will arrive at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ Tr@@ actor wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; thereby , the compact Infin@@ iti suits with its s@@ inu@@ ous lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a fuel engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; however , it is also a diesel car with 80 kW / 109 PS , or 125 kW / 170 b@@ hp . &quot;
Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno who celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with petrol engines , including a newly developed 1.0 lit@@ re of Tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer information at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be launched in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new but completely renewed , the compact class model DS 4 , which is shown on the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; extern@@ ally , the designer of the ed@@ len Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Abl@@ eg@@ ers laid hands on the front part : here the cooler is drawn new and the changed spot@@ light with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior space , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment@@ system is modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and is integrated for the first time ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;
added to the I@@ AA in the compact class a set of adap@@ tations and new variants as the recorded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meters are decent un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary quarter , which was housed mon@@ stro@@ ang in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; due to violations of their human dignity , prisoners have no claim to financial compensation , when they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision has decided by the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht in one on Wednesday published decision .
those affected can even hope for the judges even if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in those in close spaces ( A@@ z . 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ mate coinci@@ ding with its Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell hall with around five square metres of ground floor ; the toilet was spatial and spatial . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who has moved upon the testimony of his lawyer by now on the open foot , moved in a larger cell . &quot;
his Am@@ t@@ sh@@ aft@@ ungs@@ le@@ age because of the un@@ worthy liability conditions against the country Berlin fails .
but the Constitutional Court rules the verdi@@ ct of the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al in Berlin and transferred the case to the renewed test there .
they see the human dignity of the man in@@ ju@@ red .
Chamber of Ap@@ pe@@ tion decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the fragile period only a few days of liability for compensation were decisive , be given a compensation committee . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a tra@@ verse of the legal protection of the personality would be &quot; &quot; fear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als must now clear the amount of the joint damage .
the Constitutional Court have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; so they said only in April of a prisoner w@@ ager , because he was locked naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , a decision from 2011 is estimated also to have a cell count of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday he also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , the a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ essness in November 2009 an anti @-@ worthy accommodation . &quot;
the then Kl@@ äger was twice a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to missing personnel .
&quot; prisoners are therefore again included 23 hours , the aggressi@@ vity increases , even to tri@@ ggers it due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the legal en@@ press@@ ors , 21 places in T@@ egel because of young workers are not occupied , 19 scheduled for 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what to do in Germany ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers have come to Germany by forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Minist@@ ries in this year , according to S@@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated this positive challenge in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I will say again and again : we can create that and we are creating that .
&quot; what is ad@@ mitt@@ edly on Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; for different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments annually , while the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built up ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; dramatically , the lack of living space , but above all for paid rental items : annually fall 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing from the ten@@ tion binding , and around these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Minister , Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is therefore aiming to double the promotion , of currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is the reason for the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing had to arise annually , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; additionally , scientists and Federal Minister of Ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute of labor market and vocational research , 55 percent of the p@@ oul@@ try in Germany can be en@@ listing . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started out , Claudia Walter , project manag@@ erial management for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is decisive whether they find jobs in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for esteem in the request society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigration society , says Mig@@ r@@ ation@@ alist Diet@@ rich Thr@@ ben@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , the ben@@ ben@@ hardt has given a political transition according to the Thr@@ ben@@ hardt : the employment proposed for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; in November 2014 a work offered for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the Residen@@ cy , the asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour , a majority en@@ su@@ ally en@@ forced the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing interpre@@ ter .
&quot; so far , there is still no part of the offer in general and business @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often taught by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore based on Arch@@ ben@@ hardt of the König@@ s@@ weg to the integration integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees trying their children to teach in kit@@ as , estimated at ten to 15 percent , &quot; &quot; for the root @-@ finished parents , it is only once quite important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ eph@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
to convince the family nonetheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita to distri@@ butes the management of manual list in different languages .
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators should rise up by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity by organising more technical colleges . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without interpre@@ ter in welcome classes on the lessons .
&quot; they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second @-@ tongue . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ eger of the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany do not want to study .
&quot; in principle , no state of asylum seek@@ ers or Ge@@ toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was previously Berlin , Interior Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his attitude now . &quot;
a study of students could be facilit@@ ated to facilitate access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence , or D@@ ul@@ sion will not receive benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers Act , even if they start studies . &quot;
&quot; the latter generally does not receive BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the circle of the hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; refugees had to have lived in Germany so far four years , to be entitled to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this pan to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s state Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many people , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually lay down the same rights over Islam , as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop into a new state @-@ religions ratio . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare state , which is professional taking care of the new anch@@ or@@ ers . &quot;
on the rights also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contact persons , to work together with the state in many areas and give him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes willingness to face religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the central council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ cy@@ ek , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts can also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to exit such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately their right to refuse here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he suggested that the Basic Law was interpreted in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in future .
&quot; in this way , the majority of the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism will eventually change . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a more fiscal decade - an anti @-@ discrimination position and a general gender equality law .
&quot; but it continues to learn very slowly , like the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ series , police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist form . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what Mig@@ rants family organizations and stakeholders have long been calling for international treaties such as anti @-@ racial discrimination , must be realised in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide the so far @-@ awa@@ ited refugees to provide medical , ob@@ serves doctors &quot; President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding al@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , money has additional money to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid engines , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all deriv@@ atives will be handled immediately in the registration of health types . &quot;
brought services later to the federal states could be appropriately charged .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able so many people in the limited power catalog ab@@ duc@@ ted out of the asylum seek@@ ers Act . &quot;
else to make doctors first of all the language barriers .
&quot; before so far , the Berlin European researcher The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse than their disease than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical offices , interpre@@ ter would have to cost interpre@@ ter . &quot;
would be helped many refugees but also with more general medical contact centers in the emergency treatment .
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; under refugee sk@@ in@@ ders about , there are much more untreated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ clarification . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other path@@ ologies , German doctors came from their training but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; the paras@@ ite cor@@ rup@@ ture or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not as difficult to recognize . and what the in@@ toxic@@ ation affects , even through the refugees would possibly even all@@ evi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans have had a highly developed educational system , several refugees even were doctors . &quot;
&quot; to practice them , they would have to prove their qualifications and may prove once again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany are sick , according to estimates of Bund@@ esp@@ om@@ lens ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ic ill : most of them suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress @-@ depres@@ sive or depres@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; particularly vulnerable , Refu@@ gee , says Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study of TU München demonstrates that every five Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress @-@ provo@@ king that is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breath@@ s , di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , heart blo@@ ws and death . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are bed@@ - and concentration of concentration , strong sho@@ gh@@ tening and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psychological sufferers in the social offices can place an application for psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly in @-@ workers or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this lead often to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus reveals on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
&quot; the goal is to draw any age group into the B@@ ann of fascinating acoustic , s@@ dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus itself invites into the cir@@ cus on a brick and was@@ en to dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without living my cir@@ cus &apos;s family , &quot; says Ms. rehear@@ sed , vet and juni@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current Man@@ eg@@ en@@ ins@@ em@@ ination .
the cir@@ cus in the hands of the family has been prob@@ able since more than 33 years .
the gift to ama@@ ze lies the family so in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to take away people from their everyday life and to take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stressed the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junk@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic@@ e@@ cock@@ tail with world city @-@ air , &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard rehear@@ sed his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the just 3 000 km of tours can now experience this flair .
the program of cir@@ cus is convinced with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family takes the audience with wit and charm in their spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the cir@@ cus movies I want to absor@@ b the Cub@@ an duo .

your humor@@ ous art in the m@@ ast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s arms in the storm .

60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ ani@@ es mother , Brigitte . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject of various animal rights organisations .
&quot; Stephanie performs also a position : &quot; &quot; it is not good to our animals , it is also not good . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stro@@ p unit .
&quot; the four @-@ legged arti@@ facts , as they are lovingly called , will be read according to any wish from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; does the animal feel not comfortable , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege . &quot;
the top Command@@ ment is very good for the animals .
&quot; specially on their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is eag@@ erly proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived in one en@@ closure eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was here , &quot; says Brigitte . &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the wars , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus . &quot;
there is likely to be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie , &quot; &quot; whether five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all our hearts . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds true speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa , from one podium at the beginning of the year , Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa , from the beginning of the year came down the stairs . &quot;
he remained in@@ ju@@ red but the video of the Falls spread rapidly across the social media .
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also asser@@ ted by declar@@ ations of the opposition , that it received anonymous death toll and had warned them , to accompany the speech of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ased . &quot;
&quot; last month they had hidden him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the nation in parliament - this is the speech , which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their cell phones that warned them to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ ks .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists after the publication . &quot;
&quot; she war@@ ns the parliamentary group members that the immunity will end in the Parliament , and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the boss said that Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai &apos;s party was &quot; worried , &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will detect up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard will be expected to build 25.000 to 30.000 jobs within the frame of restructuring and saving efforts in the services of the company .
&quot; HP will be split up later this year in two listed companies , and will separate the computer and printer business from his fast growing company hardware and its service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job market leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Company , &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chair and Chief Executive , which is to be governed by unity . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused than it is HP , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of shops that support companies as a transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US @-@ 2012 revenue and will be focused on providing so far @-@ reaching technology solutions for companies as an explanation of the company .
&quot; it shares a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard , and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was named &quot; the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring running to tackle the return of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ maker and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
&quot; FC arsen@@ al captain , Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates just need to stand behind the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; little emphas@@ ised compared to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it &apos;s just September and provided his rehabilitation to plan , there is no reason why he could not play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario doesn &apos;t mean that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in light of its history , its involvement in the next summer will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame on this recent problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate pipe @-@ injury , and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ eas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; says Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healing .
it is not a greater issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his kne@@ es or with the injuries that he had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but like turning , there is the per@@ tin@@ ess danger of further injuries , always when a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it is also developing an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd release 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 out of arsen@@ als than 157 Lig@@ uria in the last five seasons .
the broader image for arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most vulner@@ ability .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the viol@@ ability rate will last over the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes if you come back from an injury , you have to gain a temporary period , a time when you strengthen your body and win combat . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the kind that he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening to Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ line next Wednesday and turning a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with Ki@@ er@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and to give players who need it , to give a small break , &quot; says Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al clear favour@@ ites are , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir &apos;s Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play parks with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also released after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night by a earthquake , where the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 was measured . &quot;
this year it was the 10th anniversary of Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lessons of the last season with the Champions League of Monaco , remains the far @-@ reaching hope with its management the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
I have never worked at the arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons for men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ perate than ever since self @-@ murder in young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death rate in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , announced the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ at ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ po@@ orer life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the goal of finding the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece in the struggle to address this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms presented that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , &quot; its chances of recovery is double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , it is a circle of spiritual healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , you must first have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media communications communication , with its focus on style over substance , the in@@ calcul@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , life @-@ funny and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by which psych@@ ologists call extrac@@ tive values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health a lot deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game @-@ invent@@ or and milli@@ ard@@ är recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
&quot; the Beautiful at Friends was , that this focuss@@ ing on the head was placed . &quot;
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , by his interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ ours of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents at soccer gu@@ cks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men can definitely hold back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone calls it to me : ... &quot; my cess@@ ation role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ ide , has really shown myself clearly , how the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference to me . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old speech &quot; &quot; I come to cope with &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness in case you talk about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider on the phone face man in moments of desp@@ air can also help , the long term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit at this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ feast with the celebration of the day completely new designed scenery , why do not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better if you see travelling in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say Hi . &quot;
you never know which distinction could make your friendship .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the whole 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; di Maria hits to help PS@@ G to mal@@ m@@ ite , mal@@ m@@ bling &quot;
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Sh@@ son Cav@@ ani to Malmö .
&quot; di Maria hits his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to go to Malmö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and the son Cav@@ our held course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain began his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malmö in the Prince of Prince on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League de@@ bu@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before they finally reached their lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ quarter . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A requires a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they will not only seek the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ turns but an improvement on the way to quarter @-@ finals on each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no classification of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ ni I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed opportunities at the gate . he was later in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began its illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it is a good start , 2 : 0 to gain our opponents problems to cause and relaxed back , even if there are certain things we have to fix in the course of the season &quot; , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we won &apos;t have scored one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three modifications in the Paris team , which was last weekend : 2 Un@@ decided to hold its sole place against Bordeaux on the First League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
the Argent@@ ine wing stor@@ mer was called the man to take the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when it ran over the last month by Manchester United and he pointed out why he was completed in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense until he closed down to Johan Wil@@ and past beautiful in the long corner of the network .
&quot; if however , someone felt that PS@@ G would have a big win he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off proposed to achieve this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ ag@@ ons in the field and was built with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who traveled far from Kevin Tr@@ p P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself gave themselves sometimes on , with some wrong cas@@ ks and bad fri@@ ction , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in no less than five sellers alone in the first half of scrat@@ ches and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the restart . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed out much more skill if he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c to the Di Maria in a shooting , which was passing by Wilson into the 5@@ 2nd minute last minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate was finally made shortly after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay puts his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left side of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all thoughts that Mal@@ mö@@ s can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of wild and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could hold the end result , before sub@@ title E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ vey , gave later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 Change to FC Bayern
world @-@ champion X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for the summer of 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just prior to the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish Master , three times kno@@ ck@@ out champion , four times champion @-@ league champion , two times champion champion , two times European Champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the children of 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years left the FC Barcelona and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; however , in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi is now that he stood before the departure from Barcelona before the end of 2008 . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça want to sell me .
&quot; Madrid , at that time all , we did nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this is also registered for FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
to the memory : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi is not changing
but the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man for this today works for the German record master : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; bar@@ ça has done Guardi@@ ola under Lisbon and I played a great EM . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety of film coverage
Matt Dam@@ on dealt the af@@ o@@ american fil@@ mm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she will not need behind the scenes .
&quot; during a row run by the Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , as this is the need for alternative perspective , stres@@ sing in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about variety , then do it in the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; insured dam . &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked with loaded un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! Wow . okay . when the comments of the actors made by The Mar@@ tian himself .
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production of production , Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , Brown : &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ ut@@ te that is be@@ aten by her white breeding . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People was set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the Director @-@ rights in the film , Dam@@ on re@@ resist@@ ed that her director could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media has explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter and users Mr Po@@ oni impres@@ ses his w@@ ut over the clip expres@@ sing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO VI@@ O@@ TH@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et deser@@ ved more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 sor@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on comments arrive at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s wide effect and sc@@ ary leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and authorities to discrimin@@ atory practices against colour versions . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made an approach to the movement during the introduction of the nomin@@ ee albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums were silent , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , records still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leader of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s movement have published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the guides . &quot;
&quot; recently I was announced that Dam@@ on was at a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether the invitation has accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; kr@@ ön@@ t first champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete which won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which has just closed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ ero@@ o Ge@@ off B@@ ritten until the final . &quot;
at the last task the plum@@ bers belonged to a 75 feet long clim@@ ber @-@ rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; B@@ ritten had ended the task within the time , with which he ended the first ath@@ l@@ ete which ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds more quickly , which made it the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said to E ! news after the hard fight , still under the shock over the win of the Great Prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never had more than 10,000 $ worthy or life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his p@@ ile money . &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the producer of K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why building , although he finished first at all , not anything else . &quot;
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and changed life he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s swe@@ pt in any gro@@ ll .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
&quot; among the masses , he received from fans . &quot;
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad she is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for a recorded season , the filming will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers cre@@ eks on Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers standing on the last place in the American League Central .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , but the part offered this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 target . &quot;
the tw@@ ins sent a chance to asc@@ end within a half of the Houston Astro@@ ros stage for the second American League of Wild@@ Card .
&quot; Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return to the three letter F that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad exceptional . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon gave up his early offensive support , when Detroit had scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , once again in the sixth and then once in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 cour@@ t@@ ings and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; I will finish this year strong , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw at the bull@@ pen of every game , and therefore I want to concentrate fully into the game . &quot;
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hit and was in two R@@ us his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
&quot; it was the first tri@@ c hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle on 6th July . &quot;
&quot; he has taken the head@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; said exclusion . &quot;
&quot; he looked good in the ( perc@@ ussion training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ dog , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the rear , at the end of the seventh interior the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ ding Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks finished a hunt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he replaced with the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy won the wall , the only man who was confronted with whom he was confronted , before the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Rookie group Miguel S@@ ano , who made the right @-@ handed s@@ w Tr@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play .
it was that in the Major League leading 27 times this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ps made a double play
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth court , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed du@@ ach , however , was on three Pit@@ ches for its fifth finish . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ ited to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from one still not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the Ri@@ gh@@ thand@@ ed Veter@@ an , who was removed before the game from the vulner@@ ability list , after he was missing for a back st@@ acked more than a month ago . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt comfortable , when I got los@@ ed and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches for the third inning . &quot;
&quot; received the lead in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ er gave a single in Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out Walk on J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed its 0 @-@ 21 track series with the running doors in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third captain Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand side , managed to run a further run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game than he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers presented a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not done so well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a Pit@@ ch Count which had no points in the third inning before it replaced by the rel@@ ever case of A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three hits with four hits and a walk with four k@@ ke@@ e@@ outs .

no diet @-@ fruit - Mang@@ os contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but who wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender is often more likely .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them are B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular also contain man@@ gan@@ os but lots of vitamin A and its pres@@ et beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits therefore supports the immune power , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body . &quot;
when you buy Mang@@ os should not be too soft or too strong and pleas@@ ent .
the nuts alone simply says nothing about how the fruit is - so can also taste green man@@ goes very delicious .
you should store at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives the hearty dishes a special note .
it makes the slightly bitter taste of some Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

hammer artists invest three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the principal pieces that has painted the Oth@@ mar Old for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written and updated the introduction of scrip@@ tures .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with beautiful paintings now . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture for Oth@@ mar Old , who had formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Old at his bi@@ ble project worked for which he met a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles have emerged are cycles , who dedic@@ ate themselves topics like cross , pl@@ edges , commandments , or f@@ ather@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; thus , he has spont@@ aneously fascinated by the same number of partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther publisher with his the@@ ological outlook as well as the Kettler publishing house with its focus on artificial books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who pre@@ ach themselves on the basis of painting with the respective Bible values . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible study conducted by Ot@@ mar Old Bible and thus translated into today , into current connections . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original Bible collection of Martin Lu@@ ther and one movement of the artist who form@@ ulates here his very personal thoughts to the particular situation .
the jewelry band has golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old appears twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately raised to the sh@@ utter for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant rulers . &quot;
&quot; then the education ever happened with the barrel floor , &quot; reminds of Ot@@ mar . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to re@@ plen@@ ish this , in order to be able to forgive me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help the art of increasing significance in the fast @-@ moving period : &quot; the perception of sculp@@ ted is today of complaints , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Oth@@ mar Old wants to let the observer have come into the images , let them work , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stolen a visit to the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; as always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ine Kunst has been : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old have not magni@@ fied the Bible fully grasp , but also selected for him important , including mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text was described merely . &quot; written be a photo @-@ Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen life and find freedom . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler , both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility . &quot;
part of the origin@@ als - paper and can@@ v@@ ases - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition presented on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction site for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn met

&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration care for po@@ uring , especially among the residents who did not want to take the train . &quot;
so hill was brought down to new place - now with formal planning and request for building permit .
&quot; the approval will be in October , the First Pop@@ der@@ eg@@ tin Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now disclosed to the children and Youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; then , without &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; were started with the work at the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga will open a clear sign in the weekend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; football is responding to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics to overcome its help when tackling the problems . &quot;
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ union . &quot;
&quot; there is no one to say , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting for everyone , this issue in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B Group Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
during the annual meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor &apos;s office and there , the State Department of Mrs Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; since the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the crucial ordination has to make politics .
the German football federation has therefore expanded its refugees &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ liga are supporting this program .
&quot; already on this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ i will place a clear sign , if they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ mel , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that all should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Lever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ Office Ru@@ di V@@ ö@@ ller the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and referred to as a &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama is all about , nobody can take away . &quot;
&quot; we are able to play football team , no , we must use our radiation , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees who have already been so incredibly bu@@ sted , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ open@@ hei@@ ms General Manager Peter Ret@@ ailing spoke of a &quot; &quot; prominent signs of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for EM @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women are 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as a &quot; a large communal area of German football . &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ en@@ see have started in their place in their own projects is great .
&quot; just as great , is that small and smallest clubs are active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; we spent in football . &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will compete with the DF@@ B selection and the German government for 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Ver@@ ga also already called &quot; &quot; reported &quot; , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Vor@@ ar@@ j@@ ef gains an eye on accident
&quot; the stand@@ ar@@ est pit of Europe &apos;s largest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has said many reports to have lost the left eye through a fall beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; after the accident on the stairs at the House of his brother in the USA he was after midnight shown on a wat@@ ering , which he carried on in the left hand reports the &quot; &quot; Economic Week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost embarrass@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then has dropped out into the street - that &apos;s why he told us the last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ where &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Super@@ visory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Turn@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the 54 year old manager was in the meeting at the meeting and &quot; &quot; fully compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday instructor ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software . &quot;
&quot; I am fully for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got all the time in regular contact with the Super@@ visory Board and the chairman of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ Mot@@ t pend@@ ant usually between Germany and the USA since summer but has not been more in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; it is important to him with such a personal story to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; anyone can happen that such a thing . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , once you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot Kn@@ sia except freezer ...
&quot; Magn@@ ets t@@ witter@@ ing a corresponding picture and explained , he suffered the injury , when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes with a separate age in Singapore on the weekend as well as reservations for the two genealog@@ ist Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button in@@ quired , as one week later at the Great Prize of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : women &apos;s eller in the gate
with Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us finally sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player is also missing to the table leaders of the football @-@ leader in the du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ kl@@ es on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga team against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coaches open : &quot; we expect to return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ kl@@ es will change its Stam@@ ets not only on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
he announced a change on the gate position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ n@@ eller takes the place of the tri@@ b@@ art@@ ar Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , whether past@@ es in the future will be used in all Europe @-@ league games , but E@@ chel can be open . &quot;
with high probability it is also de@@ parts the second game .
&quot; the research statement of fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the final withdrawal for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has its target to act as mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for trac@@ eable : &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to retri@@ eve the title .
robot @-@ au@@ tos : government aims at the cutting edge for Germany
Germany must be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner following the will of the Federal Government in the changes of the car technology .
&quot; the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which is available for investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt am the edge of the ven@@ fair I@@ AA of a &quot; new mobile era &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected chassis will increase the traffic safety and ensure less steel , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from G@@ 7 countries who also come together with representatives of the industry on the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ api@@ er des Transport Ministry is among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band design and of an increased level of operating on digital radio .
the testing of new technology is currently created a test circuit at the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order to prevent the driver &quot; &quot; no additional liable risks , the federal government wants to examine the legal fr@@ ame@@ works &quot; and , &quot; where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany is about to use internationally for allowing the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 km / hour . &quot;
&quot; the German government will also apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; at automated driving takes over , the car gets the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; after a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 is technically possible . &quot;
&quot; still , travelling vehicles on public roads were to be expected only far to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ CH@@ P can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Trade Policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the issue of adhesi@@ on in cases and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clear however clear . &quot;
still the Germans are skep@@ tical but skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey on the AA award at the For@@ sa Institute in behalf of the Test @-@ Institute on behalf of the Test for@@ gan@@ isation DE@@ K@@ RA will lead to the result that only eight percent of German people believe that autonomous cars have come through in the next ten years , 31 per cent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France 21 percent of respon@@ dents expect to deal with aut@@ on@@ om travelling cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of D@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to take control over the entire drive on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , this could be detected in flowing traffic 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , each Fourth would be left to the vehicle under no circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll offers team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to stand on the cover of the cover from 25 September to 4 October only at the single .
the final decision should be cancelled later on September 22 .
&quot; that is a great loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; said Federal trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ excursion in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was at that point on the flight to a long @-@ term budget sponsor in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are now no longer as a clear favorite , &quot; stated individual @-@ champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also rec@@ alled to the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; anyway , Timo also was missing , and we became the European champion . &quot;
&quot; in this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world &apos;s tent@@ ative fifth . &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has drawn up a serious injury to the right foot .
the Champions League at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven was hit by the def@@ ender of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno and after long treatment was changed .
the first diagnosis was pointed out at the 20 year old co @-@ player from Bas@@ tian pig to a railway line .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a duck .
it is a mixture of very large Mo@@ den@@ look and a gu@@ ide@@ figur@@ ines : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look thanks to video @-@ proj@@ ections sc@@ ary human .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer who was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Büh@@ l out@@ fits to the great star of fashion scene - and so that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was born slightly , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18th at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO Cultural Foundation , it is good luck that the mo@@ des@@ k@@ iller @-@ creators has changed his initially si@@ ghted attitude about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , let him have been against it , for : &quot; for me it sounded a little bit after death &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already done in Montreal and in Paris in Canada .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ its . &quot;
it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into this little @-@ looking work of the man , the fashion history has ever written , without ever to have an education . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the vision is not being built , but it is a beautifully chore@@ ographic work artwork , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ aming the doll@@ s , for example , was engaged a sty@@ list . &quot;
14 tons of material made the makers after particulars of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the launch of the October festival was still a special s@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather p@@ ile out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are sl@@ ain than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , delicate mo@@ c acid test of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he found his Ted@@ dy Bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
the de@@ bug@@ ging of fashion he then joined himself later on .
he was st@@ ained of fashion journals and saw the dr@@ afts of other designers such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it but of course .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the Models . &quot;
they got nothing but they were allowed to keep the ch@@ ot@@ tos .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener head as fashion @-@ niche
previously it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ ies in and about lo@@ wing about it .
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and leaders have emerged in large amount for customers , which they worked for example as blank@@ ets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; today alone does not work any more , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ sp@@ itz Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead fashion is important again .
&quot; in the early times of the seat , fashion played a major part , was then squee@@ zed by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , for accessories such as po@@ ckets and in regional tr@@ ailers . &quot;
&quot; this is the so @-@ called vintage mode at all , which borro@@ wed itself in past styles , an increase of the potential . &quot;
who is not served in the textile sector in Germany is no longer a market .
with us it is already half of all orders .
Mo@@ ed@@ don Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member of the branch association co@@ ar@@ ener head and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only them must carry the protected label .
&quot; during the last 15 years , about 80 percent of its sales were broken . &quot;
private business transactions and also the wholesale market there is almost no more .
our products achieve the customers in this manner hardly .
&quot; nowadays , the mass ware will be produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export of export , currently to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points via environmental awareness , such as Cor@@ du@@ la farmer has been explained by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we introduce a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; diplom@@ design@@ erin U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snow @-@ report of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au , at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ al@@ ising in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips . &quot;
&quot; to mark the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; it creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories that need to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot;

&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - above all to customers who have lived in Pl@@ auen and the surroundings and who want a mem@@ ento . &quot;

&quot; but , according to &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; , &quot; however , it is not a kind of new fil@@ mm@@ ation , but about a kind of continuation that 20 years after the first movie is playing with the magical event . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world crisis in England .

XI ur@@ ges the economy to open up the world wide
&quot; the economy must be able to open to the outside , to promote growth , &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group which was commissioned with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should enti@@ ce to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in an agreement with the 16th meeting of the Central leadership for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and will bring new place for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the group @-@ group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list of regulation of market entry , relaxation of border controls , funding of the state @-@ agencies ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and re@@ conditioning of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not identified for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because the market has a greater role in the ingredient of resources , a far @-@ reaching meeting environment and created the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the government will also set controls over the powers transferred to the companies , and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business . &quot;
&quot; the statement also said that China &apos;s border areas will allow , to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and develop new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; in the scope of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better service to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit , or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee to ex@@ ert their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; the division was attended by Li @-@ qi@@ ang and important guides like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as published in a statement after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double the mer@@ cury po@@ inter series in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishing
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in big pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers therefore have a much higher dose of nerves .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans are sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of faul@@ ty industrial and environmental policy are passed with full W@@ anted of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt said the threshold values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ per or s@@ word@@ fish in &quot; economic grounds &quot; of one on two milli@@ gram op@@ cury , depending on kil@@ ograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; big rob@@ bery @-@ fish are now so strongly stra@@ ined with mer@@ cury , that at the basis of the still existing threshold values approximately 50 per cent of the F@@ ands must not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ ven@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the threshold values at other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram op@@ cury per kil@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; however , Food@@ watch was considered as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cemet@@ eries , such as carp , mostly so low are charged that they already meet the planned high@@ s already . &quot;
&quot; the separation of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; an fi@@ brill@@ ant distr@@ act , which alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; Mercury is one for the people of high @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which is strongly increased over the food chain - above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish . &quot;
the federal government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already low amounts of particularly in inf@@ ants of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment can be explained in his homepage with regard to current high@@ s , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; cannot be expected . &quot;
Mercury is mainly due to the coal comb@@ us@@ tion into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of Environment Agency , according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of Finance , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total population in Germany total . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and surface area , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; in March was c@@ ited from the paper . &quot;
&quot; in the year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings issued before mer@@ cury in fish already led to the most common health risks at EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
