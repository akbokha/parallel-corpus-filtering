Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as an ambitious measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the meeting , it is also to go to the conflict with the Palest@@ in@@ ians and the discussed two @-@ States @-@ solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington critic@@ ises the continuous sett@@ lements of Israel , and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of lack in peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Obama wor@@ ded deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two further deteri@@ orated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu was held on invitation of the Republi@@ can prior to the US Congress , which became a controversial speech to Obama as a aff@@ ront of Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the first time in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a emergency call Professor to have shot his friend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb with a somewhat tender voice of the police , that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was it important to bet@@ s that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the house , the officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written not@@ iz , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no notice that Lamb , who travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , where he was shot a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Delta State University of Police Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day there was another death : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after shooting in the university , students and lecturer to hide behind the closed doors , the authorities always try to get a picture of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details published by the investigations on both ends of the state , as well as the staff and employees who knew him , they helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students said that they looked forward to his classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , he did not have history of violence or crimin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had been mentioned in one of his written book , where he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; in which he did his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both sub@@ ordin@@ ated in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time there were some nests to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , the Lamb , said , he seemed too little excited and nervous , &quot; if something is wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that the lamb told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb had asked the Delta State University in order to be asked for health reasons and said that he did any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this year , he was only two online courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest changes in employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for the Lamb has worked hard for an automatic way to an accumulation as a Assistant professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that cannot answer the Lamb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the flight from the campus , the police took place later , when he drove to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Arkan@@ sas again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before he was arrested , k@@ ills his Lamb with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ i@@ meth@@ el Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car still ran in the entrance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb said to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb grew in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , 2009 he began his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12.000 inhabitants and signed Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received his doctorate in the spring of Education .
one of the long @-@ long friends of Lam@@ bs took him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston , she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met with common friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to bring the guitar game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was at the time of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melted away , when he was there , Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the back@@ stone house , which at a ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ish@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they have stayed 15 years ago , but friends were left and a daughter that was 19 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he joined and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago , two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later they played together with one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said to his daughter and sings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had the Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after the Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic@@ iel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no signs that anything did not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple &quot; said he said .
we were at the cleaning and sli@@ pped together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of sh@@ ear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American U@@ clean@@ ses and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and students .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in C@@ lev@@ eland , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the congregation on a Ker@@ zen@@ licht commem@@ orative ceremony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother J@@ eff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ind Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be recorded on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from C@@ lev@@ eland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was corrected to re@@ affir@@ m that the police had shot that he had shot him as his wife , and that the Lamb was shot in his emergency call . but there is no notice that the two ever married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Toys R Us plans to introduce less working forces for the Christmas time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Toys R Us says that it is not as many Christmas season employees such as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will have a chance to work with him and seasonal workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it will cover 40,000 people in shops and sales centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michael J. Fox has about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat at Theater in the theater , and I mer@@ ke that the seat is empty next to me , and it is gradually clear that Princess Diana is going to sit in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am sim@@ ulated and a arm length of it , with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time , &quot; Back in Time &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Zem@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg , &quot; Un@@ str@@ o &apos;s biggest journey film , which was ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN Chef says , There are no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon says , his answer to Russia reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there are no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only swal@@ low violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN CEO again demands all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to establish a political solution to find a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday , that he plans to discuss the minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the edge of the General Meeting in Syria to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t that the adv@@ ances in the Council and within the Syrian people , and the regional powers are in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an requested the five permanent members to show the crisis in Syria , who have demonstrated the same solidarity and unity with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 conversion values which show Donald Tr@@ ump seriously .
some have tried to make him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ can try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges to pol@@ ls , it has not work yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys , Donald Tr@@ ump showed in two @-@ digit area , and some start to ask for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody said that Tr@@ ump probably will win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts bet@@ s that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was delivered to the rising Herman , not only a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but external side groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are some current conversion values , that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity are rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candidate in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until mid @-@ July it were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ can have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep in early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week , that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they were either thr@@ illed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump were nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say , they would be angry if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same above Tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they would be un@@ satisfied or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ish , the candidate would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ can sees Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ature not as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Donald Tr@@ ump , the Real Estate Mog@@ ul believe that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number is in the first prec@@ ed@@ itary state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where he has the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , 44 percent , that he did not conduct the personality to perform effective office , and almost six of 10 independence that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House pas@@ se , so ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get involved in the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they set up their schol@@ ars , rep@@ ubli@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump the best bet be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time , when four of July , their money was put on je@@ b Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear crystal ball in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Republi@@ can , that Rick Perry win the nom@@ ination would win only 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ wound Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign is viewing as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the Republi@@ can gather around another candidates , Tr@@ ump strikes almost every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts point out that the distor@@ ted field will probably be distributed to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ oth@@ etic head @-@ on @-@ head races between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points lead to Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before the edge of Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ oth@@ etic head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race .
a cr@@ ust majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say that they have formed their opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have awarded their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it can happen to change this , and no one can really say , never change the opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said that they are open to the door open to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of neu@@ ros@@ ir@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who have formed their opinion , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of 10 Republi@@ can say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , since two months of immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , the immigration and fishing point in public dis@@ course was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ sions of the Republi@@ can party will be remote , and the new ori@@ enti@@ onal efforts will be damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ can do that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light remains , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climbed up to new levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , mainly through their out@@ se@@ iter status . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

and they are also angry in Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ can have been demonstrated by the Republi@@ can , with 54 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive living in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg the most expensive complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the road , a square metre square meter costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer is limited to objects naturally , is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers is a square meter most cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , one of the price is just like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Real Estate Service Engel &amp; Compl@@ kers released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square prices in weak heights .
there are several ten thousand Euros - per square meter .
but well that who can afford it ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way : Munich , Munich lies not at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Got@@ tz@@ e
two @-@ fold tor@@ ch in Pir@@ ate : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hits from Thomas Müller on the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Piraeus - then ran &apos; s .
a so@@ vereign start of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; mission in Milan .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her debut game in the Champions League at the Greek record Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to a double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9 . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9 . 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twel@@ f@@ th Star@@ ter@@ fol@@ g in series is supposed to be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller received at his 28th hits in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership specialist by Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ k Roberto , who left one as a flan@@ k thought of the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ Kapitän Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pir@@ ate had won his youngest six home games in the Royal class , including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next sacrifice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they went bra@@ ve to go out with its obvious efforts but often to un@@ imagin@@ able works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks were often managed by playing on Lin@@ ks@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , which was rarely crossed against the former Braunschweig Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller had been lucky by right , than his flan@@ k made out of the right half field in the left upper to@@ ck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ falls @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then by direct removal the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Bavaria her lived in a dominant game , pir@@ ate N@@ adel@@ sti@@ che could set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Manuel started on Tor@@ hil@@ ter Manuel New .
for example , when he was a shot of ide@@ ye on the lan@@ tern ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before New , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a quadru@@ ped square with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in K@@ ader , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Hero have given first light after the final training , said Sport@@ committee Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the gra@@ vey@@ ard Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller added a way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the game it came to Kra@@ w@@ everyone in front of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of shared Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently the followers of hosts Pir@@ ates with words and gest@@ ures had been prov@@ oked , the safety forces and went out against the Munich pendant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was wounded from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever smo@@ ked , not only the lungs , but also the teeth - which lays up a Potsdam long term study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good news : the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out of the long term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to qu@@ itting smoking , the risk to lose their teeth to lose the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ F@@ ache higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of teeth are c@@ aries and inflammation of the tooth &apos;s tooth , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , bet@@ s the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the connection between smoking and dental loss may therefore go back to frequent teeth infl@@ amed with noise .
not be clari@@ fied , as far smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who heard with smoking , their risk could reduce their risk within a short time , writing the researchers at the Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it could take over ten years until the end@@ an@@ gering back to the level of qu@@ eries , explained the first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are persu@@ aded to convince people who are non @-@ smo@@ kers , stated study manager H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and leads to a good dental health until high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by denti@@ sts , divided the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
earlier investigations have already been noted that smoking is the risk for early dental failure .
the new long @-@ term study was w@@ alled the findings .
arch@@ ae@@ ologists fly to Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on the remains of the late ancient
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for repeated time , on the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne , archaeological finds were made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close to the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ ae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum Skel@@ ette and remains of historic buildings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine are histor@@ ians on the search of so @-@ called ground monuments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum will always be moved as a specialist for arch@@ ae@@ ological soil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards the arch@@ ae@@ ologists were now fifth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from text documents , it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century has got a church , explained Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the rest of the fortress and the cherry , a cemetery with around 350 graves were discovered , probably the church belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman at the railway station in the Ge@@ il@@ enk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ lin@@ t is un@@ fortun@@ ate , the Federal Police asks the population for assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the early morning morning against 1.@@ 40 , the woman crossed the woman from the railway line at the end of the railway line , and was recorded by a freight train that came from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the acquisition of the state , it has borne by the police police according to the police police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was treated locally and was treated by rescue forces in a hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the reason of the noc@@ turn@@ al track crossed the young woman lie no findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident has been observed by witnesses or residents have taken an acoustic truth .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over the TT@@ IP new court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the Stre@@ its on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private accommodation equipment for disputes between corpor@@ ations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds significantly more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trust citizens , declared the competent EU commission@@ er Cecilia Malm@@ ström at the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ din has to enter the proposal as European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is to be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans to reform the current arbit@@ ral proceedings , that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to the same parts from the EU , USA and third countries .
for the first time there is a second instance for the first time .
it would allow it to lift against urine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the travel involved among arbit@@ rator , a contra@@ diction against their original items did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , a citizen of the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice is not familiar , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term she wants to work on a International Investment Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the major investor @-@ Sta@@ ats arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration shall critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ iz , over the company claim damages , national laws or decrease of consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ adequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised , above all that they should not apply for the free trade agreements with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German economic Secretary of Matthias Mach@@ ining ( SPD ) showed the plans as big progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission &apos;s major points , the Federal Minister of Finance Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Business association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe war@@ ned , the re@@ ge@@ ance of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially small and medium companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the talks on the free trade agreements TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday .
the negotiations run since mid @-@ 2013 .
however the subject of investment protection has not been discussed with the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement already exists at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is valid as no longer .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on stage in Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to him , a f@@ lip@@ chart , on which the shy was recorded in the picturesque US State Michigan with fil@@ z@@ sti@@ ft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells about various places , which he always shows on the map , which reports his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and tender songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where they were created , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stev@@ ens has experienced Stev@@ ens as a wonderful creative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear clever songs , which can be harmonious very close to American Folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time in the great op@@ ul@@ ent dri@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it arises , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a long series : each of the 50 US federal states should be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in Rhein@@ near already , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and has a positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stev@@ ens reduces Stev@@ ens here .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year later , the musician returned to the series in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens In@@ v@@ ites You To : CO@@ ME on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ka &quot; ) appears a nationwide master@@ piece in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
transl@@ ate to ideas and sty@@ listic fin@@ esse .
the album goes into the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of the influ@@ ential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then serves to &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic processing pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all the effect and hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago , the stage shows the stage shows here for the colorful spectacle of Neon @-@ Stir@@ n@@ ity and large fluorescent stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens are part of a five member band through Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are nearly 2000 guests have been sc@@ anned in their chairs , the significantly spread Stev@@ ens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and the Folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a word to judge the audience , the Group is playing excellent musicians through the wide enriched album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience , you hear : the lecture is &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; and you can thus throw away the &quot; plate in basically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only one addition to a addition , Stev@@ ens is modest , playing acou@@ stically few older songs , and finally falls under Tuscan appl@@ ause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister has been expected for his choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister , and for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to lunch in order to present the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , with its performance from the media probably and the Labour dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called &quot; fewer theat@@ res and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that he could skip some sessions , to leave her colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because she comes after his appointment to the member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ov@@ y and his speech on Tu@@ c meeting on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the day of the National hym@@ n at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence on a number of T@@ ory M@@ PS prov@@ okes and stands at the centre of several title pages of stories in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he would have been standing in respec@@ t@@ ful silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour chairman to sing the national hym@@ n , &quot; regardless of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shade @-@ minist@@ ers have refused to serve as leaders in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ line of the Parliamentary Party was originally supported as leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within Labour , &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns to the position of the European Union and the limit of threads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference that Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions , that the party is very clear to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chairman , the David Cameron , since he has joined T@@ ory boss since the last decade over the D@@ isp@@ atch Box in parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour chairman , who promised another politicians , says that he gave &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that he has under@@ stands the question@@ ing of the Prime Minister , and that he will fight for a serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , which is represented by the shadow of economic Minister , when he is not part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues may take the word occasionally , and that he spoke John Ber@@ cow who spoke the spokes@@ man of the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was linked by the Prime Minister of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre . &quot; but some years later he found that he has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound rose spr@@ inkl@@ ed after data that show a rise in wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to the FT@@ SE 100 , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ Target SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between May and July , the result was raised without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.9 % compared with the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and investig@@ ating income over the time of interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 , compared to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market , and made a jump from 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the Rival AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transaction would combine two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world , and brands like Bud@@ wise , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and G@@ rol@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bur@@ berry shares were to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury , Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts will propose all expectations and showed that the sales market in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - back to growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shares of G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E rose 5 % after the Berg@@ bau@@ ri@@ ese said that he had taken 2.5 billion US $ through a share of shares as part of its strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest tra@@ ilers on the index , and with a drop of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sachs had its assessment for the company rating based on sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the athletes had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports tells us that higher wages of expansion is end@@ anger@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher wages for UK workers &quot; more purchase in the pockets of potential customers could mean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that these merchants become the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 15 @-@ year old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Just@@ in yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the pol@@ o sits on the cold stone plates in Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ damer Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wik@@ toria should sit in the tenth class in the Gymnasium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with each doll , which looks like he and over the cargo goes to bending bending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

potatoes or tweeter ?
it &apos;s both - and in the potato tweeter that the Ol@@ den@@ burger Im@@ b@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; potato &quot; potato &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat is placed together on a s@@ ke@@ wer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster using a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the wording , &quot; potatoes instead , which he had seen randomly in television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , in his shop a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea did not leave the Leban@@ ese in Munich by the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a manual pattern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ ie@@ ß , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only so much : &quot; it tastes better even better . &quot;

Met@@ cash launches ground @-@ speed campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ cash tried to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of a Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
food @-@ wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a floor @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Al@@ di opened two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of the next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and marketing over the social media , as well as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ borough , which sell used tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash publishes further details of his defense strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ alers of Food , alcohol and devices through its annual investors strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it stands much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs IG@@ A @-@ Lad@@ in stores and generate higher profit margin as a Met@@ cas@@ hs IG@@ A network in the Eastern states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purchases in South Australia and Western Australia include a lot more powerful market than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and take all existing actors , but mainly independent sol@@ der sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley published that IG@@ A @-@ retail@@ er will lose 360 million euros per year and Met@@ cash 250 million US $ to the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this progn@@ osis is based on the acceptance that Al@@ di opened at 25 branches in SA and 30 million in WA , and will achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and 600 million in every market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in food and grocery store and in the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ hs , Met@@ cash could cost about 13 million profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time Met@@ cash market shares in Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan was found that IG@@ A @-@ purchases are the faithful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgan Stanley particip@@ ates that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in food and grocery store in 2016 , in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10,@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ cash refused to react to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is gone out that a member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week , has been taken away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food trading , which has been reflected by 43 percent since 2012 , which is reflected by 43 percent since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the wholes@@ alers is however more than 150 million $ , in order to improve sale with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths during improving their stores every week and deliver a better choice of private foods to provide a better selection of private label foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs main Executive leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ table and load @-@ Zanzibar programmes will be expected to return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ision damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly more praise to his own behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the youngest of the talented du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special KS &quot; is called &quot; Special KS &quot; with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fier@@ y quali@@ fications in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to beat twice by the arbit@@ rator , &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to beat Cy@@ rison , and I should propose the child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he had seen a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ ative US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , was defended by He@@ aly civil war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth , in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I was pretty much more , is the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi was a little in the war , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he lost a ra@@ cket , when he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken down a ra@@ cket with themselves , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , he has in the US Open extremely good behavior , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so , and I think that he deserves much recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around , he has a great family around himself , and I believe that he was a little too strict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very nice 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players , he is good in the form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think it deserves to be assessed after his own self service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly supported the decision , Cy@@ gios will not take into account on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he ensures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition , and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ aries around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I believe that Nick very quickly made the Ascension , but he gets to help him to help him that he may think it is best for the crew and it is best for the team and it is the best for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , holds refugees back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary explains the staff and ri@@ eg@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all the feast to come to the land . all with the aim to stop the stream of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chaos was followed on the border as hundreds of migrants in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who fled from violence in a landing strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fruit illustrations were increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police impact over them , the migrants &apos; open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ ells of ins@@ ults against Hungarian will@@ power police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were back from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that migrants were back from Hungary , during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must take place in the coming days discussions with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian Serb border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels , no joint immigration policy could be agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who had achieved their hope for 40,000 people - the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement was achieved that the EU states had further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungary , Hungary continued his hopes of Brussels or his neigh@@ bours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two southern regions , authorities in two southern regions gave local authorities to unlock the crisis that they could lock roads and asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is also to stop the construction of a por@@ osity , to stop the stream of migrants by the land - after it ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even war@@ fare in the race , the spine wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last months , Hungary became a lot of war crimes from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has passed on the search for a better life , and not war to protection - a view that are strong in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new laws which stood around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Z@@ a@@ us to build the government along the southern border with a crime . this laws also lay greater liability for convicted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation that originated through the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; President Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ e said in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very much : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , but re@@ porter is expected for next week , but re@@ porter of the Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people have to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come upon by calling the fence , they are now acc@@ ust@@ omed to police and shall be accused of off@@ ense according to the new laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungarian officials completed two of seven border dives with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos gave the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pressed a crowd to go there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 20 succeeded , but thousands remained outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would like food and water until they may travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t advantage ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former U.S. Foreign Minister Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to continue a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters with the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who still has not announced , whether he receives the Presi@@ dential Office , receives support 15 percent of the democratic voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , which candidates will support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ ton supporters are less than those of the other candidates in their choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost several winn@@ ings during a series of demo@@ graphic groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton holds a great advantage of women and temper@@ ate but this pre@@ jumps have reduced itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their support in men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders lies here only with 5 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ton Adv@@ antage at democratic voters under 50 years has turned aside , and they are now on the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton still has a big advantage with the older voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , Clinton was with two @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , that they would like to support enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support them with some advance , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six percent would not support them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ t current supporters , especially of you are thr@@ illed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are stronger than those who are currently not supporting Clinton - just about one quarter would be delighted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic voters say that she will support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters above her nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Clin@@ ton supports it in an open question , why it is the most common answer that it is time ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Clin@@ ton supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is mentioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approval of the problems with the problems and the guards are also cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the Vice President th@@ rows a potential for the Presi@@ dential Office in the Wa@@ ag@@ dish , would like to see 57 percent of the democratic voters in the race - although a third belie@@ veth that he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the democratic voters will be asked if the party would be asked for their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Clin@@ ton trailer , more than half , that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den , does not decide for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t advantage is increased before S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate to win the choice ; however , this figure has declined by 78 percent in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is with a distance of a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks like the &quot; selectable &quot; is risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , when the question is more important , the Democratic voters call questions about the vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no only demo@@ cr@@ ative candidate or potential candidate for these voters are un@@ acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates deliver good results at some important features in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted by strong leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den cuts in three candidates at the best of hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t strength is the lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , the Democratic voters generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these measurements , about one quarter of democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton , using a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as a Foreign Minister , they are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is another story in the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the Americans now is un@@ happy with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the Americans said that the E @-@ Mail @-@ contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion is still wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 that are to say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for a honest and trusted person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights are not far as hon@@ est@@ ly and not trusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes with guided tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush on the best with hon@@ esty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority looks more than honest , but how in Car@@ son have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error rate for the sample sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters with the election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is going on a further survey near Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ ubli@@ can voters remain in large number . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before the Fox News debate in the last month , around 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ son stood at the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son at demo@@ graphic groups well arrives and Tr@@ ump under rep@@ ubli@@ can voters with university education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the rim , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio , Governor John Kas@@ ich , who is at the lowest point , and of 10 % support in the last month is now 2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Florida Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Arkan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are with 6 % on the third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error mar@@ ge in the sample sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was performed in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey was published , that Car@@ son has been published in the pol@@ ls - it rises with 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at one of the last week , Tr@@ ump took some side down for the former neurolog@@ ist , even after Car@@ son , Tr@@ um@@ ps took place in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is a trip to the Mediterranean Sea to find hot water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic can be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mediterranean temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the east , it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the Adriatic , in France 23 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ ages were submitted to five people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials , he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound backpack full of sand , and repeated attacks , while he tried to walk over a frozen field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally accused about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not called the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g , and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they had time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , said police leader Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ ds began to hide and ordered the good of the Brotherhood about that by Michael Den@@ g , said police @-@ Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning to his injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an aut@@ ograph report , Den@@ g repeatedly repeated injuries to head , tor@@ so and tor@@ n@@ igh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least one student , Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg were destroyed every year since 1970 , Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brood teams and their members have to be drawn to calcul@@ ates and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monro@@ e received an indictment due to murder of the third degree for the first five members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged because of sh@@ ic@@ an@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to be responsible for the participating persons , but when it has been an organization , that - officially or in@@ officially - this is done , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has with@@ drawn their states to the local group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a c@@ rate monitor comes , and the house will go into Wan@@ ken , R@@ end@@ ites will rise to bonds , and the economy will lead to a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we do not know , how long do everything last and how long it shall keep it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history for the economy is only low instructions for the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recession came to a recession within only 11 months after the first interest of interest , and lasted 86 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at the lift of interest rates are often , if not always , a factor , as the economy and financial investments react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representative of the U.S. Central Bank thus emphas@@ izes that investors should not concentrate on it when it begins to increase interest rates but rather than the period that is required for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , market participants may determine that the whole excitement might be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of a tick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is to be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we don &apos;t expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to fear the se@@ ism@@ ical shock that seem to be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not mean that there will be no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a historical trends based on historical trends , as some areas of the economy could react : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the market has seen last month , the procedure can take place for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the increase , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently an tendency that assets accounted for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , the German @-@ bank anal@@ ysts will be reflected in a newer study , which will happen after interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more accurate , the market is usually estimated at least 14 percent in the past 35 years , with an average yield of 2.6 percent in the past six days , with an average yield in the past six days , with an average yield in the past six years after a current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , boss plant @-@ Str@@ ate@@ ge published at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , with Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares ten@@ sion@@ ally later occur in the increasing cycle , and the return on the return begins to reduce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essi@@ ons are a fact of the economic life , but c@@ eas@@ ants encourage them often .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions , which could not existed before and the recession could accelerate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extremely remarkable , that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point at a c@@ rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , there were only two nominal GDP under 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 amounted to 3.6 percent , only a few that this is expected and expected for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at such a frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether it is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all year , market participants have made up the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strings and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all Incre@@ asing cycles of 1950 to today in a super cycle took place in a super cycle with increasing vibration during GDP and on @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ial , very fast after the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; thus the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what is the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has waited for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market was given a c@@ rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect is faster than with shares , when the strategic course change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for bonds , the R@@ end@@ ites seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle is done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the increasing cycle the attacks fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Str@@ ate@@ gen from Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to the rise between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come anal@@ ysts expect more often in such a climate , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ anal@@ ysts in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some signs that the market has been adapted to the views of dangerous monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the tragic is flat , credit lines have increased , and its volume has increased - all features of the market , when the F@@ ed has failed its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and all the company , the major part of their business activity in the United States will benefit from which interest rates and local products will be more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debt are worse , as an increasing dollar makes its products more expensive on the global market and as the financing of their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares will tend to react , three months after a initial tick @-@ rate , we said Gold@@ man Sachs anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed the company with weak balance sheet in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at the average of 5 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with high capital ratios as well as low Vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their pend@@ ants with low quality at the average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
debts will be a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a high proportion of flexible interest , Gold@@ man said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar outside of the pure markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spar@@ er could see profits by higher income , even if experts are different , how fast it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM and the Parliament &apos;s member of Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter due to its &quot; evap@@ oration &quot;
he ar@@ gu@@ ed that he is increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also aims at the BBC Music Awards , and said that they are only The Br@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle The Voice The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts to Classic FM , claims a leading Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do what the private sender does not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ ative member Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio stations &quot; and increasingly won &apos;t be different from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; stupid &quot; do not want - but it seems to transform to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aims at the BBC Music Awards at the BBC Music Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started in the past year , The Br@@ its only seem to be under another name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , which is actually only the im@@ itate which is already on the market , said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC @-@ General Director , the accus@@ ations back and arg@@ um@@ erable that BBC Radio 3 far off his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and inform@@ ing the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , new music to find and new works in order , I &apos;m really important for important , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to engage them as it did in the past , because the British has been informed about classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production , which took place during the hearing of culture , media and sport for the selection of culture , the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory MEP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle The Voice of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media for a estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall consisted of that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Judge - &quot; on special BBC @-@ way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wish to find the company &quot; a hit from our house @-@ house stable , &quot; if it was the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he refused to expand the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or give money to other entertainment formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Internet sales rose in August at slow and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the lowest result has been the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has captured the expenses in November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping is drilled , and many of the main shopping streets Great Britain is transformed into mind cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but experts say that there are now signs that the online turnover stag@@ n@@ ated after new numbers only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say that the signs are stag@@ n@@ ated that online sales stag@@ n@@ ated after new numbers only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and until 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that the online sales amounted to more than three years ago , as a buyer , with their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it meant that more people could buy online , and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now that one , and we may experience , that growth is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the following turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers will take their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some tra@@ der websites were stor@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer would be cancelled because of the buyer , buyers could make your purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study of British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that from 5 £ spending a little more than 1 £ online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now conducted via Web @-@ shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the inner city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane of the crane accident - Bin Lad@@ ens family will be gentle
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in Mec@@ ca by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse part of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group to load the load
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane fell down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves as 29 of the victims of the streets were killed by the streets that were killed , than a crane at Mec@@ ca Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sad filled , largely dressed in white , the route to zol@@ len as the first of the dead their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ zu@@ m cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fun@@ ession moved to the Holy Site , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bet@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi king took over the construction companies of the family Bin Laden because of the cat@@ astrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 Ver@@ last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies of 29 people were killed , when a crane was stor@@ med by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were worn by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi @-@ Official already said that H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city , continue to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would not have the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arabic version of Dec@@ ree , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad are prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man caused to reveal the overthrow of the sick , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place later in this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden Group has published no statements about the collapse of the sick , and their representatives stood at your disposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree also caused the group because of non @-@ current security measures , because they don &apos;t have co@@ operated with mete@@ or@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

British employ increasingly craftsmen who says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has a rise behind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to 200 further screens stores , which will be re@@ opened on craftsmen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it claims that Britain will perform their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of qualified Eastern European craftsmen that carry out work in their home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are sent with a hammer or a brush to remove walls , they belong to a minority nowadays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open King@@ fis@@ her , 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which will focus on craftsmen and 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , they employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten merchants are taken in charge of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment the men survived the men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , It is necessary to present the growing demo@@ graphic trends , which have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger to a balance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a major role in the decision process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who listed one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed in order to reflect a same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company , which occupied exactly 50 percent of the teams with women , including its Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher gave a decline in half @-@ year pre @-@ profit and restructuring , after the group costs the costs for closing the stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them was indicted because of the ministers of ministers .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ end@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 schol@@ ars of associations that were able to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he measured the damage with around 400@@ .000 euros .
the sports@@ men are also charged for finance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact divided the chairman of the opening sen@@ sen@@ ate , Rich@@ es Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is supposed to be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for leaving the un@@ faithful , the defence , that the association did not have been an asset manager at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports@@ men could have been working only allowance and the sports club , for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and invested some time and money in 2001 - the Pas@@ si@@ va was invested around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44@@ ,000 Euros ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we introduce the club further or lock ourselves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to the accused of the accused , in the bread . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have recorded money , our life insurance as safety at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the association , you can manage the money free , there may only be no debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as the result , the payout of the allowance has been decided until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one can have a part of the allowance only years later , when one Plus had been on the account , it pays off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , package and not detailed specifications on , explained by the former Ob@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accounts and spar@@ books , the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the payments of the association had not been manif@@ ested in detail in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not interested in detail in detail for the financial statements , it was important only the debt freedom , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the def@@ enses have been , explained the accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second accused , and was not known according to the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
it did not know for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , he believed that this is the best for the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something happened , nobody would have thought out of this money , the prosec@@ utor stood in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the co @-@ accused has been informed of the functioning of the function .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why pollut@@ ants ? , wanted to know judgment and state prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained the first accused , he was not agree with this formulation , because the association never had a damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all from the Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as the function said , he never counted a cent content , it is calculated only o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Di@@ ets , he made the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort has been much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accurate documents for the early years could not show the accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were evaluated after an operating test , in which everything was evaluated correctly , no more kept , declared them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter money also had the second accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all Be@@ ars are in cash , and have to drive from his home town market to lead to lead to lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for US emergency bank
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world observed if the US emergency bank will come to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to meet the important decision , whether for the first time the interest has been raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey under 80 econom@@ ists who were asked of Reu@@ ters , that the F@@ ed will do that the F@@ ed will be more than half , and the interest rates are to hold on the current status of 0 - 0,@@ 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a historic event , because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest set up to NU@@ LL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach ourselves a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , said Angel U@@ T , conduc@@ tive staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US economy has been added to a relatively good performance , trillion dollar will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the F@@ ed can not ignore the less raw view of global conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has war@@ ned the markets to increase in an increase , but the signs of the chances that the chances are good for such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision will be announced at 20.00 o &apos;clock CET on Thursday

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 150 of the worldwide around 1000 executives worldwide , Group sales will cost the workplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goal of re@@ orientation be a result of some 500 million euros per year from cost , and soluble syn@@ ergi@@ es , divided the airline on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , there is no responsibility for the passenger business in the Lufthansa future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap aircraft line Eu@@ row@@ ings sol@@ le is as possible as possible as possible .
in the Executive team around Carsten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the re@@ position , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with the Group to join Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees had strong company complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air@@ line operates under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the union divided the union .
the theme of talks is supposed to be the building regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , cockpit of the cockpit &quot; faster result will come to portable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and Air@@ line led to various strikes in the past months .
background is next to the transition supply of the pilots the Spar@@ concept &quot; Wings . &quot;
it looks that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitors routes to the group &apos;s own trillion Eu@@ row@@ ings .
under the title &quot; dawn in the south &quot; are paintings of Le@@ ena Kru@@ ger in the artificial house .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this left , Louis van G@@ aal will not leave him for at least six months from playing games , Louis van G@@ aal is not able to play that Sha@@ w again can play in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injury was caused by a backward attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno , after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was built in the PS@@ V area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated for nine minutes on the game field and needed oxygen , before he was brought into the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg and lies in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then done it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the revers@@ al cabin he had a oxygen mas@@ ke .
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the hanging of a mis@@ ery .
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van G@@ aal knew that the Italian arbit@@ rator had changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was due . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words , I &apos;m not able to describe my way to the genre now , I get stronger again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here : Manchester United made the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of PS@@ V
the England defender has an additional incen@@ tive to recover from the European Championship in France until coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury the place , all very sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is never the intention of our player , a opponent to hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg in Mexico against Van Ga@@ as the Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury that is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing which I could see , was the ball , who had touched him in another direction when he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into the hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter to learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children book was asked to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was created in 1971 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the site of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in the Cameron said the action of the book version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the quite short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ re @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone to see her desire to see a real tree called Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ v@@ ete and died in 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if this is not enough , the text is described as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he has to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems to be a prag@@ matic boy , as the local environment is so little familiar with the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a hollow , sle@@ epy , &quot; which is in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to an hel@@ per , the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in each other one child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a down@@ ing @-@ street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Camer@@ on &apos;s election office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons staff , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England , but it is still hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one has chosen the K@@ ader , the England for the tour , is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series not on my card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a reverse victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ last@@ air Coo@@ ks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the joint ist is strong ; they will not wear a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball , Mo@@ e@@ en Ali developed as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on the test level , is an option for attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th is removed from the England test @-@ test , and replaced by Alex Hal@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is of course for me as his head trainer in York@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are oriented to results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this , players have said their own best . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before long time , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he beats further purchases for York@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not have good services , and that surprised me ; he is above all a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time a test punch is awarded to set his character , is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to go home and play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise in the Caribbean - as a Ly@@ th in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a punch man whom I get high .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ist , which we saw in York@@ shire early in this season , when he met 236 at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must receive at least the same chances as the before him , but of course it depends on the team of course in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ e@@ en beside Cook , which would get an extra spin @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qu@@ icks would be fulfilled , and I did nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a punch man cannot beat there , and this left side has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ e@@ en has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made three hundred R@@ uns immediately , and looked not back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ rip Ans@@ ari comes in the k@@ ader as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people may see its statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers that lift their hands and the train@@ ers have decided for youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions to the train@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est candle of the game , who is to bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights , of which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices are able to bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in harmony with the previously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ys team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will not agree but coding and team@@ work does not determine the schedule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must think that as with players their jobs depend on the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not met in light heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = Des@@ cent Great Britain from the EU ) could win , when the economy will win until 2017 in a f@@ lau@@ te unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; David Camer@@ ons un@@ balanced new strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leaders of Labour or Tu@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ ats , and said that some member states that are deeply ro@@ oted in different crises , as the EU it is now and not always out of their own guilt , Great Britain itself , and distur@@ bing the contractual changes , which they usually don &apos;t want , full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Brighton , Tu@@ c decided that the Tu@@ c on its annual meeting , that it may not like to protect the social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed to summit or bilateral sessions in foreign capit@@ als , make a photograph of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes to be outside the Great Britain inside the EU &apos;s tent , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us know that more and more short @-@ careful ministers and officials come up to the point where we are no matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel has been a allies , but she has been leaving the ministry for 10 years before it looks bad for them as it looks bad for them as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its en@@ forcement in 2017 .
he is also a verb@@ al force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic government , Spain a left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it falls heavily , that they should prevent a leg to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent their energy better to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , but what they do not want to have to be separated in most similar ten@@ dencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some of such ministers may even be able to accelerate not useful comments , completely in the SN@@ P style , during the Great Britain &apos;s report campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t won any value from the new trial . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Europeans know how nic@@ otine can be the oli@@ gar@@ ch@@ ie of the press bar@@ one , as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which was supported in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who has made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all his understanding , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Med@@ ley was one of the tax caring , telephone and p@@ seu@@ do non @-@ in@@ countries that possess most of our large newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , Tony Bla@@ ir had been similar to her , but she said that if you &apos;re standing with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas to be removed instead of lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was rejected more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir , as he had rejected the principle of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that was opened to him a back@@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the press has never missed it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a kind cl@@ aps on the back - I said to him that he had no time to repeat me - appears in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ boy@@ ott Mur@@ but a mistake at that time and today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can take , but he must gain a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa will leave on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I press it very kind - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ant tendency and wild fil@@ ming from Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; is a Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week , did not admit that Cor@@ si@@ ns appointment of the provo@@ ke John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it rem@@ inded me to the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father sat down on television , loyal to his Labour cabinet , without losing his cabinet job without too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not that Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow workers and dep@@ u@@ ties to all reports on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what always wants to give me - news discipline remains important - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and before all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe to give him , Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ ary campaign for self @-@ understanding , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks sure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns to EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist debate - is not just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under left dis@@ sidents , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with its majority of Nato , Tom Watson is rocky , that J@@ C will be committed to the exit - the foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their pre@@ set at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin political capital turn , they have also mis@@ er@@ ous voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be meaningful ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government at the start on Monday , which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts critical report by Public Health England about E @-@ cigarettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the claims of a state finance agency that e cigarettes less harmful are made from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts to write in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) in their report by public health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but some researchers have put the load capacity of the data , and sent to the connections between some experts and tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ win@@ ful basis &quot; on the P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J , and asked if the asser@@ tions &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public is expected that the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been conven@@ ed to develop their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ otine hal@@ ve products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , the Managing Director of British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants explained to the meeting , funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturers , but not the financing which he have received after reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , of which some also include a sector financing in paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants at this session are not known for know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the session the tobacco management of P@@ he took part in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; stands , that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ er report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and well@@ being at P@@ er , said that the re@@ pt@@ ations of BM@@ J has already been re@@ acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second living smo@@ kers dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence is close to the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to the low , but that we continue to study the long term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he has the unique duty to the public about what the proof , and what does not exist , especially if it gives much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , smoking costs two billion £ per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the clear advance of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should give East@@ En@@ ders the former CEO of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice , &quot; he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm as the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs , which cannot be sent by other UK channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for this , that they can see public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen from a smaller audience to place the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and must@@ ard like BB@@ C4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson , that he tried to get in contact with the BBC 4 in his time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes can be shown in order or send the clearly of non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson of the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee on the Future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to hold the radio fee , what I am medium or long term not for a good idea , you should not make its production at least on programs that do not make any other or in order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ culous , it is natural . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ im@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , assigned both own productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hon@@ est@@ ly other channels would give their right arm .
I try to see me how this is the public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC debt was working there for the amb@@ itions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments to the most popular shipments of the BBC will return again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that there should be rather public @-@ legal n@@ ical programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 , but they can not meet their tasks , but they can fulfill their own sacred missions and they can have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs which has seen no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they put them in a time window where nobody wanted to see them ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the radio fee , Johnson said to the Committee , &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ ression system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we think all that you get a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who is true for the 150 £ a lot of money , if it is true , because they consume not much of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also told the BBC on Tuesday , called the BBC their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , &quot; to maintain and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % in the radio , and they should change to the public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful in television is shown to make everything online now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment , in which they are pun@@ ished with sound im@@ pulses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified Ner@@ v@@ ens@@ systems which can be controlled by er@@ brü@@ tet from sound waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny Nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment , in which they have to be heard with sound im@@ pulses to high frequencies , to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; im@@ pulses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , the gene@@ tically modified to bear the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another topic in this topic : researchers reading and write shep@@ herd with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lim@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the brain for the treatment of Parkinson &apos;s disease treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thread tri@@ mmer not react to ultrasound , but Hal@@ as@@ ani , that they did so , when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bladder , he found out the ultrasonic waves , which then enter into the wor@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reinforced ultrasound waves work on structures that are called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ duc@@ ts and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves work the opening of these icons , and activate the cells which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ at@@ odes , the Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ o channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he turn ultrasound to the changing creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ algae and turn into the wor@@ ms where they change the changing mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light and switching off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike light , which has to be sent to a visual fiber to the desired spot in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasonic shafts can be un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the skull from above on the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gen@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are on bus stations and in the subway trains and require a second look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with D@@ LR ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) reads in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the D@@ LR line , which turns into the image of a arm@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many artists have been doing with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to enter into the real world , so that their art has a influence on society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic company , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight Golden Rules for Life in Student
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of eleven years ago I moved to Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ality Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the sp@@ elled smile of which I was angry - and to the numerous , long complaints about others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of what I learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence ranges from slightly ner@@ ves up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ w@@ ling : people tell you , where you are interested in Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are hon@@ est@@ ly said , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n or why you are just a He@@ fe@@ extra@@ kt ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and help others to do the same - make questions , and show interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the conversation and helps you to find people who would like to speak in contrast , with which you would not speak , even if your lashes were in fire and fire extingu@@ isher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let humans leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people put on and their under@@ wear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , do not think about the university with a relation to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence form a room @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ mel culture , the friendly and soci@@ ally @-@ long friendship can lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be hell for someone who tries to recover themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I will go to you , but you have to get away the energy , which I used for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to feel when a comp@@ il@@ it@@ one of Ges@@ ness is exhau@@ sted , and send it a SMS instead of kno@@ ck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ ids : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you start the Uni on the climax of Back Man@@ ie , the monastery on the doors of the back , is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood &quot; Welcome to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
homemade delic@@ ac@@ ies offer a good way to close friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your fellow inhabitants feel obliged to enter@@ tain himself , and will make your face associated with a delicious surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; po@@ or@@ ly mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat make that people feel sleeping , if you have ank@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
food to steal food is a course crime in student residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chick@@ ens is a theft , but it is taking a drop of lac@@ tic for your tea also ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check this with the breast@@ plate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chances are good that they say , even if they cook in the inner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any man moves your things , it is anno@@ ying , and you don &apos;t try to carry out my compassion as my compassion for milk to climb th@@ ie@@ ves around th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise from sleep or from the work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not only about to be a decent man , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb , which are sitting in the glass house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neigh@@ bours , whether it makes them something unusual , drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it had three clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they re@@ acted on it with more powerful music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she took up at 5 o &apos;clock , they sent her neigh@@ bors even two hours before she left her own music , her door lock and went up to her three @-@ day test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would be random in the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vice versa , it would not be un@@ locked , if you have to take a co @-@ resident for your future wife , and they might have to see them every day , and perhaps they have to see all the common friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the heart of his own paths - but if a hot maid is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to try to speak a little bit reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment , in which you don &apos;t notice that someone has a key in his non @-@ closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mobile f@@ ake appears as it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good thing I is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never cut somebody in room with to@@ oth@@ paste and shampoo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close your door , and lay their keys into a glass of water , which you can then put their owners at the ceiling , but put their owners at the ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ standing and Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds for people in the middle @-@ fr@@ aming Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t show how to build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are placed on the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how rapidly cheaper living room can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will be on the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or gym has no sustainability .
for the people stay in a great part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough living space in the next few decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a whole , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facilitates integration .
that is different if you teach people in bar@@ blocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six houses , which are built in the pilot project , consists of three apartments for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each housing unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how high are the cost ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is over@@ looked .
the construction has lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
did the construction provisions be complicated complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : Bau@@ legally I moved my project correctly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly complicated , it is always the threat@@ ening Dam@@ ok@@ readable value and the parking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in cities there is space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ haus project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there was that which have been thrown out for asylum seek@@ ers for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not wear the campaign for affordable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true , we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but there were luxury apartments which can hardly afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees but also the alone mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show , how you can still build and build well today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; General &quot; type and then &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at that time the group was at the height of b@@ ft petrol station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men cried with the young people , and smote this with the f@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim suffered a nose break and blo@@ ws heavily from the nose .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from his friends , the last young man was now brought home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment , and drove several times there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows breaks in the retirement , her husband is Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor to the next few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a conversion phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy on the first glance , Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently being completed in practice , and commented on practice in practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had always in the background , that the tr@@ ash would fit well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was so far I was called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate our own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patient are very attractive , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we would like to know the families over the years and accompany . &quot;
as an advantage he also see his own boss soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , one became one who bought the house with practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is two @-@ time family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up in Hannover , followed by several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tr@@ ash , both inter@@ pret@@ ations , want to be settled as household doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion the rooms are modern look .
we will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a subsi@@ dy of 500@@ 00 Euro will get a subsi@@ dy of a funding program from the country ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the church ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the church ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue to be continued , &quot; emphas@@ ized Sam@@ t@@ allest Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter in the practice field of rock , there are about 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another house practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a positive effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship breaks in As@@ endorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if no successor had been found , they would have gone too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would be visited by the Spre@@ e@@ ches , especially in familiar faces : the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their f@@ arewell end in As@@ endorf , the medicine was practiced there for 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little wh@@ irl@@ ut you already feel after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or , and many patients are still visible , &quot; says the inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is comple@@ mented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I pushed forward to gar@@ dening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ son and travels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the border controls will be driven at our south border , &quot; said the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to the parallel border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how it is clear that every one wants to make an asylum application , this also has &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also , &quot; that it takes clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less migration currents , neither about the Austrian Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously informed us , Slovenia &apos;s coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under circumstances also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so this was the Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather re@@ prove the monitoring of the border - mainly to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strong as an external border of the shaft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Minister , Sloven@@ e wants to go to Sloven@@ e for refugees but not stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fill out its commit@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Croatian Government , the first refugees have tried to arrive in the night of the night to arrive at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian police finished them in the near ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has been working with new refugees in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly around Sy@@ rer and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , he said Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that had brought migrants to the Hungarian border in Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade , however , that it may be to kill people , certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , &quot; was called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , there is a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border S@@ id , in the course of the day we would expect further buses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occup@@ ants were the whole night of some 500 kilometers distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has said , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it is now actually to the ob@@ servers of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a little further west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities to cross control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ized that his country has prepared a strong cont@@ est@@ rogen of refugees corresponding plans for possible utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details called he not called , but he pointed to that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen Member &quot; comprehensive possibilities to limit control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to qualify str@@ ingent controls to qualify for membership in the storage room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partners represent a good witness , which affects the standard of the limit controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Serbian side there are about 300 refugees in the Hungarian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports they would have spent the past night at the border of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Serbian interior Minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm on Wedn@@ esdays in Hor@@ gos , after the Hungarian border now is closed , after the Hungarian border now is closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would not be able to pay very high refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t say , whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ pers rates migrants to - dangerous - Alternative rou@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute the refugees maps , on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ef@@ ields are sent in the border region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is supposed to have heard a ring of Cyber@@ crimin@@ als , which has been replaced again in the financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR news@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the explo@@ ited information , Insider shops should have been made to the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators have been taken over 100 million dollars in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current comparison shows that even those who are tra@@ pped out of our state limits , is called in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 further accus@@ ations in the case continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators should be divided both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ations Mannheim has been working for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz there is re@@ active operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people do to do their concern , partly fast step@@ per , partly cozy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons on Par@@ ade@@ platz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ all life in a wonderful autumn Sunday , and in the middle of four large boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hospit@@ als made up with this action on her 20 @-@ year existence and looks quite confron@@ ted with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s life , therefore we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader in the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ations stands as well as for questions and discussions , as the volunteer work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while man@@ ch is a passover spontaneous to K@@ rei@@ de , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , on the edge of small discussions about the action on itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I come to me at the end of this world , I can be responsible for me at the end of this world , says the director of the di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband of the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore this public action is good for 20 @-@ year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , not everyone on the boards publicly announce , be understand@@ able , but finally it is a very personal cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject of death and dying , according to Tab@@ us , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even so far has contributed much to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a assessment that divi@@ des Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the dying and its accompanying staff belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by personal experience with the subject , she read much literature and decided to help themselves in the dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ als sent to honour , she was immediately reported immediately and be in the foundation in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 honorary members - 43 women and two men - the subject and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing secret and in the Hos@@ pi@@ z Sankt Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant sen@@ ed his winning demand for cargo services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that she plans to present about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade , 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year , in the next May , 20 cents less than with previous forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anal@@ ysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , the average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite the higher rates of bo@@ ils from heavy and large packages that will be collected from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to cost savings , higher revenue and due to growth in online stock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings solid income when you are weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than the ri@@ val UPS , who plans to introduce 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour forces , about the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first quarter , ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , served as in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , almost behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked anal@@ ysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of racks asked anal@@ ysts expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Express Unit reported higher revenue due to higher prices , during the result due to higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before opening , gentle the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on most expected conference in the years Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ ag@@ oni table , to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost one decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threat@@ ening over them at an end of the delayed , two @-@ storey seating area is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the map is a memory that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen , and their colleagues put the economic interests of the nation to all other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order of Congress : maxim@@ ize the US employment and prices here stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed guides have acknowledged that there is an un@@ locked third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this third Mand@@ ate could be announced that the X @-@ factor in a decision is to be seen , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be acc@@ ust@@ omed by the examples of zero @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the youngest Tur@@ bul@@ ations could increase in the global financial markets , they could increase this volume of interest for federal government bonds and be just around a quarter percentage point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing that they observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief economy at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , the rate of interest is not to increase in the global market , she said to wait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no con@@ sen@@ sus about what the F@@ ed will do what the financial market is un@@ certain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently question@@ ed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the financial markets await the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an , which shows only a 30 % chance to increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , it is that the strings go down the blow , that a further increase is far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average worth 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that time , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they do , &quot; she would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , that they do not have in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts have ar@@ gue that a c@@ rate of the financial markets , because they act the un@@ certainty , when the F@@ ed will act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow waste of the mon@@ et@@ ernity conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ellen had said that in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary to increase the pro@@ positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , was the improvement on the labour market in this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5,@@ 1 % in the past month , the lowest for over seven years and near the levels , which sees the F@@ ed as a full @-@ time employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases signs of a recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even though inflation went continuously under the yearly target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason has the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs it due to the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Shepher@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets at the end of the last month , after China had passed its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average fell in May to more than 16 % among its highest level , as investors were feared that a slow@@ ing of Chinese economy would be global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this month , the market has changed slightly in this month , with the Dow now is almost 10 % under the H@@ och of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , the market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation when you increase the interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events had not occurred on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employees of the US emergency bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , he says that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the effects will be on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy of the global economy is one of the principal , therefore , it should not be involved in their decision @-@ decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the F@@ ed currency authority of the world has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blo@@ ws of the former guiding of Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed its mon@@ et@@ ern@@ ing expansion &quot; can be tight , sol@@ ub@@ ims around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies , they can only monitor the developments in other place , but also with other Central banks and experts to get a better understanding for global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their decision making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; MEP Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeffrey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA , noticed this month , that the F@@ ed has been linked to financial market movements that are not linked with economic foundations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; painting , voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is set up for a tick @-@ rate , tender decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its Le@@ itz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings , despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representative made these cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability during a heavy crisis like the market , Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee on interest of the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the youngest Tur@@ bul@@ let not come near this level . he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation in which they are afraid of a tick , because the markets were exciting , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and men@@ tions not the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that they should use the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life help for refugees
more refugees come to Germany in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prepare you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a whole number of people who support un@@ in@@ valuable asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them belong Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is with body and soul teacher .
they still teaches with their 74 lungs .
every Thursday she does it in asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this is totally different lessons than at a real school .
Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric Organisation SP@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy women on sho@@ cking way , how important good diet during the lac@@ tation . you do this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts by un@@ healthy food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies give all nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnancy and young mothers fail to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research results that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to make mothers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a current study under the management of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them before the development of tum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately an un@@ healthy diet of the child may influence the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new amber of the sports hall
the council of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2,3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar panels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plann@@ ers for the long @-@ looking gym@@ nast@@ ics at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the youngest common session , was blessed without a great discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee had agreed upon another application for a building &quot; exception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; except for a special form to the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof is supposed to be built with non @-@ driven first and roof top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the fore@@ seen use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; thus we get a wonder@@ fully large south @-@ roof , &quot; Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger explained in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was again prescribed for the roof , which should be prescribed for energetic reasons - less than ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan has no &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der joined the council in general contracts generally rather restri@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , however , it is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create an embos@@ sing fall , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym in the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsi@@ dies are expected from the school and Bre@@ ath@@ letic promotion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next process step , the building application will now be submitted for the 18 x 36 meters large hall now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed as planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) has become a new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the surprising plans of hospital GmbH , which confirmed by Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ ens@@ ation on Wednesday 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the plans should be implemented , all the almost 50 employees will continue on the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of sol@@ le with fishermen and the next existing Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff , which cannot be offered by Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in We@@ il@@ heim a workplace , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employees be informed about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triggered the change the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has become a private practice since the beginning of the beginning of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and is now working on a private practice near the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer @-@ white , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , which was ready to take over the direction and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in each case a &quot; rise &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next two years , Fischer with his team , when the Supervisory Board shall lead to both houses , until then in the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ let , which is still closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the country was planned for 2018 , when the current renovation was completed in the hospital We@@ il@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ scapes Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , which is also involved in possession of the Federal Reserve , which is to be used as accommodation for asylum moving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the real estate , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say , there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are currently a short time @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what could not happen to happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; Fischer on the Le@@ ch , who had been positive and very understand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house , in the fisher@@ man has been working for over 30 years , did not have been working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked of Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of medical directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened once again in the past few decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and birth@@ aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hand of all the Rhine @-@ Neckar lions are demanded in the evening ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the mountain HC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wuppertal , the table leader of the Bundesliga is clear to the clear question , but there is no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the past season , the Bad@@ ges made a painful defeat in the B@@ HC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hunting with two clubs at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their Ma@@ is@@ ern@@ te on the service afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Aber@@ n@@ dale at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were used in the use of the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how exactly it could come to the accident was un@@ clear .
the crime police determined .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a crime susp@@ ects the police on the glue of the 16 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ver@@ r , the 20 year old was killed , the young people killed and their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has been mixed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for a non @-@ violent crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lei@@ che of the young woman was found in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a tat@@ too , he took a 20 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old , who indeed carried out the specification of the body and investig@@ ators to the location of the Lei@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning , after the evening after a visit of a autumn in rock breaks , not as agreed upon home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in search of the young woman , the issu@@ ers first came to personal items of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the missing , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged perpet@@ rators led the police then to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the bodies was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the arrest , the authorities gave the authorities to killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and the bodies were placed in the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old should be led on Wednesday at the port of the harbour , which ad@@ ore him to the load . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns against housing
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees are looking for a paid lead .
pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is in front of a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German housing market have already begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and labour search out of the EU , more people over a market that is now over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income weak citizens around the last affordable apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cover the demand for affordable apartments , it would have to be built 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this result is a study on behalf of the association &quot; social housing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus 140@@ .000 apartments are missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer committed to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many cast into the housing market , and set up into the long sna@@ kes in front of the rental apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the negative development of the apartment market is not only paid to the increasing refugee camps .
the study also makes considerable changes in the housing policy of the last years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany inv@@ ests a housing deficit , which is bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently some 7@@ 70@@ ,000 residence units already failed in the ball@@ ast areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many instru@@ ctors lived in large cities in large cities .
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily on the housing market no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large cities , the number of square metres per capita fell down again in the past years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing &quot; proposes a rest@@ art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incen@@ tives will be back to social housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the tax on the gr@@ under@@ age tax could be exposed or exposed to the basic tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to alliance attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation is necessary .
the programme for refugee accommodations in the State Bank Kf@@ W comes well in cities and municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start was founded on Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the project might even record the project .
refugees have a free nest : Croatia and Slovenia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary is virtually no flow , there is always more refugees over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Zagreb , the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Slovenian Interior , and if it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior of the Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and belongs to Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is still no Schengen country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to reach Western Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian Radio transmitter RT@@ L .
Hungary had rounded off his border for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws which entered into force on the same day , making ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , people , who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police held the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU @-@ neighboring country Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the majority of media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they came both with the bus and Tax@@ es in the Serbian border of S@@ id .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately after her arrival , they had tried to reach the green border to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees are not cast on border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose the bound@@ ary strips of other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ields are now to create a secure passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , after the closing of the border hardly more refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday the police attacked 366 days .
shortly before Tor@@ ch on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and damage of the border to us .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border Sz@@ eg@@ ed therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accused of arrest warrant up to five years , and the exp@@ ulsion from the land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority you have taken a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicant , 13 families with young children and two older people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no one has no more views to get asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungarian view Serbia is a &quot; safe third party . &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers should go down to the top .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers have begun workers .
they gathered the tr@@ ash to leave the tenth of thousands of people in the past few weeks on the road .
plywood were dismant@@ led and one of the recording bearings was rebuilt in the bound@@ ary place .
nobody wanted to finish this conversion .
Austria can reach the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has reinforced its border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to stop the 20,000 migrants , but still in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Salzburg about 1400 people wait for the trip to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the German authorities in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in free@@ way we met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
mayor drove &quot; gest@@ ure &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stayed after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday with the premises at the entrance of the tent , as suddenly the mayor of Alois Stad@@ ler stood at the entrance of the tent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany was surprising because of the refugee flow of the railway traffic with Austria , it was at the end of the railway traffic with two other helmets and their cars on the border to Na@@ he Passau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before earlier , we have made the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with J@@ ause and beverages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we said equal , we bring it by car to Passau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was of course for us &quot; so Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N @-@ interview .
they were very grateful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man did not let it take away , a generous donation to be handed over - 100 Euro for fire brig@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is very pleased to us . &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday evening in Wels on Sunday evening , in Wels to a regional train to Passau , the railway traffic was set to Germany on Sunday evening , yet to try to try the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the regional train was removed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the bound@@ ary general is generally high in the course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge @-@ firm association with the Bavarian neigh@@ bours in Sunday , had a two br@@ ittle , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Viktor Or@@ b@@ án , Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further Z@@ ig@@ thousands to us , is a logical result of a holy policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the warehouse R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately , in the erection of structures , the Federal Chancellor has officially recognised and publicly appointed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ circuit of the National Soci@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ jec@@ tives of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , which are now confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the poul@@ try to determine that the &quot; praised country , &quot; which she invited them and welcome , nothing than another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the end of winter , with us to produce decent states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , safety and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ .000 winter solid Quar@@ ters
Konrad has fully explo@@ ited all hands with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is usual that his word has weight .
the government was used to set the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first launch of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the accommodation of the 20.000 refugees came to Austria , be taken on Monday to Austria , unless Konrad and praised the organiz@@ ational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Interior spoke of a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad with a need of 85@@ .000 quartz in hot year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the number , you have to be found 35@@ ,000 properties in the next weeks - 20.000 shall provide the countries to provide 15,000 of the covenant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should there be more refugees so we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led talks with the state &apos;s leaders .
they have been secured against him even for the upcoming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow , it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , shall be clari@@ fied as the church will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
great expectations is the asylum coordinator also into the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot;
you can offer private individuals to offer private individuals .
you will also be hoping for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in emergency times , it cannot be that we have to hold a certain height of the wrist or size of the upper jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a temporary period would have to apply &quot; emergency standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , which you don &apos;t know without further into the face the ignor@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
belie@@ fs is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their employees in three to four .
the own language search was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the step@@ han@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz demands a better division
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no opening of urban sports and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is currently not necessary , since one cannot teach these measures without these measures , mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further locations should be checked for an emergency .
criticism of the city leaders in the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also afford their contribution .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not rounded . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a longer telephone at the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , the state of the Prime Minister Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) has acquired a further advance in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
See@@ hofer is assured that the German borders are not rounded .
the journey of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
however there is now the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees according to Germany will not be able to give any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the protection search would be brought with regular trains to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger called P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once more reinforced solidarity in the refugee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Austria leads to controls on his borders , is a logical consequence &quot; from the fore@@ head of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ tast@@ ic is a question of time
the general practition@@ er of the &quot; New shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry is officially completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the updated IT Group S &amp; T moved to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT , the smart heads of our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could imagine , to invest in start@@ up companies in the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neigh@@ bors - of which the next Run@@ tast@@ ic is just a question of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros of Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country Ober@@ öster@@ reich and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is considered by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 percent of the 2700 square meters resi@@ des in the building are already rented , for more 40 percent to give it requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Ark@@ ade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags stand in the new shop .
actually Jutta Bre@@ it wanted to be a dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this project had to fly the 49 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old in@@ hab@@ itation of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ern market Ark@@ ade : finally , she has now received its growth in the form of another business location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they are sold under other bags , suit@@ cases , foot@@ wear and clothing of various manufacturers , turns everything around the Fur@@ la , banknotes mark are available from 75 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have spent long , if I should open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive for the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la producers , which are sold in Bologna , from the idea of a private location , which were sold to which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the locals in the Grand Prix of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters that has its own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their fashion interest has received Bre@@ it from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me , most , when something developed and I can show new trends at reasonable prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why is why some woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , you can &apos;t answer the technical lady with the last safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe it is that a beautiful bag is based every outfit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place where the inhabitants is called An@@ ders .
this feature combines man@@ cher with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants us to be the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he is interested in foreign affairs , journalist , or knowledge lie in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ants for the U.S. Presi@@ dential Office en@@ forced the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cuts well as well .
this is also registered in the oldest K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate .
the New York with the F@@ öhn@@ f@@ ris@@ ur is a term in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants is related to -@@ zig corners , with him , is related . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned into a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers is about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that will be exciting somehow , but in its K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter way , Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump , K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has filmed a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumps to those in addition to Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for accus@@ ation , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the king of the heart , he didn &apos;t put it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ dering the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a big m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; random wise , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ maker &quot; - to High German : the editor , says she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of An@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened in the USA a restaurant for gold gr@@ en@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
corn@@ erst@@ one of real estate companies were first basic sales in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from Tra@@ gi@@ k : her desire to return to the homeland , shy on the Bavarian State , which belonged to the Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not included Tr@@ ump , because he once was without hom@@ olog@@ ation , was the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump be the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ igation statements of the descend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and the construction of a border wall , to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the pol@@ y , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a removed Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Win@@ zer in retirement sees the Americans more distance , &quot; he is always so long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this &quot; says the 72 @-@ year old .
&quot; he never cares about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm was mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz with a visit something for the Church of Church , which was generally well done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t imagine my Donald . &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , because he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had spoken at the time of his grand@@ father in the United States , as he would have had never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not &quot; says she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ end@@ els film , for the tr@@ ump long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ ograms , even in the USA , eight interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise achieved 39@@ ,000 spectators at five main cities , compared to Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , Today was an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of sunrise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far in September , Sunrise at the average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators came to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most interesting that happens every morning .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great curiosity for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of command to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama over a recently discovered father , which includes himself with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics asked if Thom@@ son had a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X Fac@@ tor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and struck the block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL ( 7@@ 26@@ .000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe revealed on average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 am to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ .000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ .000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour from The Chase is 5@@ 20.000 spectators and in the second half hour , 7@@ 20,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20.000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decline in the second evening of The Chase Australia will be confident , that Hot @-@ Se@@ at ultimately will pass at 17 : 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chase is a substitute for one million dollars , which was not managed to sur@@ render the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally published as &apos; sunrise domin@@ ates during Today &apos;

secret revealed ? ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may seem un@@ certainty , who wins the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sam Wood holds his lips until the final on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have left their ly@@ rical way , why is the perfect man for humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is provided . &quot; if not thou , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to play , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment when I went into the house and SA@@ MS energies , I felt that it was rather compatible , and I thought it in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they would be well suited and Sam Wood as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her point , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit the last week you made clear that Wood &quot; can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , I was obviously clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to him , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when she was asked , who would choose Wood , if not they , as it was t@@ orious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that . &quot; she said .
I love the left girl alike - it is a im@@ op@@ ted between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in the US - and there were many other teams that sent out to its impressive open training day at the end of the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some coach would have lost Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , when he lost a bar@@ angel as he did as the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by league conver@@ ge on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return , and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued his true face in the reverse box after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team led by the mill . he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who was ri@@ fied to forget his pat@@ rons and to take care of the next game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented with a Pun@@ t that was restored in the first playing district of the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian geography for his N@@ FL debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field , and told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine any bad start to his N@@ FL career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that comes now , you will take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne gave the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in @-@ debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year old .

actually all other main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free voters .
&quot; of course the topic of asylum will over@@ lay the cla@@ d . &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger requested the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave them during the Yugoslavia war in the nin@@ ete@@ enth years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we don &apos;t go further to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
joint asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative dishes , which are responsible for asylum systems : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; we have to be hand@@ crafted . &quot;
but the state policy is not to fall under the table .
a years of permanent tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : educational policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , cult Minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has been tested to 47 Gym@@ n@@ ies on the pilot stage of three to four years - in the result , it takes nine years to the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that &apos;s not far enough to Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss .
we call for election freedom for all Gym@@ n@@ ies that want to want .

4 People were killed after the polic@@ eman Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ os@@ se on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy were killed in the southern Nepal after the police were demonstrated in a crowd against the proposed new constitution , said a officials on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence broke out on the service evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bish@@ n@@ al Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , conduc@@ tive District officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside of a police station , whereby some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before they returned to Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ os@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber cord , of which it is known that they can kill , but traditionally produced as less fatal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meditation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ ese , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ow@@ i say that new provinces that would reduce their political influence on the proposed new constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August , when the four major political parties have signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial theme in Nepal , which has been a very controversial issue in Nepal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had killed in April of thousands of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legisl@@ ature received this week via certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this point was originally on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , Ralf Behr@@ man went to the offensive , &quot; we didn &apos;t have any answer to all questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project employs around ten to twelve million euros , since months in discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , the pictures and new details were come , called the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ ers and Member of the Executive Board at Inter@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , said : &quot; that is a giant cl@@ ut@@ z , who over@@ looks all other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he feared how many other project critic , that the traffic was greatly increased by the intended size of the facility : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens exactly on the well one hectare of the former guest house , however , is still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this is still missing , the building plans are still variable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s still too early to say whether easy to say , whether easy to live with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data is a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery that wrote a Editorial to the new study at J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to take food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years of obes@@ ity operations were proven to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies were performed in humans , the disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ der Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates , which have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BMI among those who undergo this operation , fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the BMI remained with those that non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments received approximately equal to 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , at 36 % of diabetes disease totally and at 28 % partly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , in comparison with diabetes and partly only about two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results were with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers over@@ took the patients blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent by researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by approximately 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in medical therapy , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as it reflects in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , the conduc@@ tive researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also uses average results at the two types of surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached more weight in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 5.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study shows no survival in the surgery after five years , there are references from a study of severe people in Sweden , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , the Swedish study was subjected to obes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it be so@@ othing for people with a BMI under 35 that are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because they say that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that we have to wait for long , until we take people to take it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as they have collected this genetic changes , which have made their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story playing in Hun@@ s@@ rück
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a subject that is currently in Bell@@ et@@ rist@@ ik , a young woman , too school times un@@ popular and un@@ predic@@ table , meets the warm of their youth , and this was in love with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so in the recently discovered novel &quot; we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for Hun@@ s@@ mu@@ cker readers , because he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the full @-@ professional author grew up in Lang@@ we@@ iler and is pleased that they could set up a literary monument . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not record all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called to finish violence in the home countries of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of continuous refugee crisis in his speech at the beginning of his speech in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which dedicated to ethics studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he requested , that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity before the interests of the individual nations or even continents should be placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries can be ad@@ mir@@ able to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible to come to Europe , he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria efforts to strengthen the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing in their countries will be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence never solved these problems . &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented George Bus@@ hs after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and presented that the violent reaction of the USA moved a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my side in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solving this problem lies in violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase from slopes of slopes by children in the last 4 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gi@@ ft@@ controlled centers in the US report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low the alcoholic gloves , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , at 16.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 , 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are always more common to these products , and sad@@ ly a percentage of them go in the emergency call , &quot; Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some children disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or to im@@ press their friends with the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
show videos on YouTube as you@@ ths disinf@@ ect@@ ant only because of a cheap experience .
yo@@ ung@@ sters supp@@ os@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic mouth water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be drawn from attractive nozzle of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think that this is bad for it is &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ables .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berries , wine sad and orange du@@ ft that are very appealing for children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
slopes contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children can lead a few sprit@@ zer for alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you would leave no can@@ ck whis@@ ky in reach of children , and if children come from it , then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which had been taken in front of stra@@ w@@ berry wall @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was brought into a notebook for treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your blood @-@ alcoholic con@@ centric was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which applies in an adult law , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , which she was treated at the G@@ ame@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te their words and was not able to go down when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spread over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girls had fallen by the alcohol , and the head said , R@@ itch@@ ey said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was very fri@@ gh@@ tening , &quot; Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could be fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use soft @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were also associated with deaths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the gor@@ ges of slopes of slopes , which had a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees of health authorities conce@@ aled that the product meth@@ anol contained , a fatal solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; Teacher , &quot; by taking anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , thus reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teacher is highly allergic against slopes and verb@@ al them from their room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police entered the negoti@@ ated plan as &quot; skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the consequence , he entered into the stern of a audio and whether this vehicle on one before the Ford Fie@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

rum@@ ors : no com@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the just a bad place at Celtic Glasgow , De@@ ila gives you that the test@@ ers are on a bad place , but that he will turn it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA for the debt of Ne@@ il@@ son and War@@ bur@@ ton to be careful with January @-@ new@@ com@@ ings , which could destroy the unity of the Ka@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ ons increase leadership over Celtic on five points
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey@@ s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time , Aberdeen gave a cr@@ isp@@ y victory over Hamilton in P@@ it@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays just about the cam@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ors of the Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneous by Griff@@ i@@ ths , which he and his teams are not under higher control , as they prepare for confron@@ tation with the Dutch table guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football @-@ bo@@ red defe@@ ats - de Bo@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Rang@@ ers @-@ Mittel@@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of tension in the old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ar de@@ ila .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RON@@ NY De@@ ila accepts that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to handle things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exp@@ ulsion from the Champions League followed the defeat of 10 @-@ man from Aberdeen , which now stand out with five points advantage clearly at the top of the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ila said , &quot; Celtic had already bad times , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very angry or sad about what happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we feel the just so - but we have to go on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need , really the support of Celtic , because that makes players better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful with January transfer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , a few weeks ago , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful with the signing of re@@ adily accessible and har@@ med that he does not want the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players who come in summer , have seen this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crew is really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes more damage will be executed by using un@@ necessary players to add , which you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; there are no crew that won everything won , in Pok@@ al@@ play or Li@@ gen , who won &apos;t won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland , unemployment remains unchanged during the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the period of May to July , unemployment remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period by 10.000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5,@@ 9 percent over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , such as the numbers of the offices for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the employment fell in Scotland around 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number over the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland met the historic decision , part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labor market with an increase of employment and a decline of unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ disturbed the exp@@ iry of the process
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the security personnel was not satisfactory , the staff called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only with the use of Pfe@@ ffer@@ spray the officials could take the stor@@ ks in awareness .
a breathing @-@ alcoholic test was at a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
Her@@ an@@ growing was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and remained in awareness .
why I will be a execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a viewers gallery at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ex@@ iled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation was already mentioned for the first time in January , and even though I was sho@@ cked , I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the day closer , I began to fear me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I voted , because I thought , it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists may see in the United States , and there are often more applications than places to choose to decide who is chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media pitches from 12 to five .
who is selected who is going to watch it .
I cannot do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship with telephone and a two and a half hours visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a note that I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me to give me on Twitter to my un@@ part@@ isan .
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the story of the prisoners , as he wants to receive and receive access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I agree with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they formed that she could have better form@@ ulate it , but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of things that I said and wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says to me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public@@ ity work of movement will help the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ e of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts which I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go here again on all details .
I cannot say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to him , a fun@@ eral of fact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I think sure that there is no enough evidence to just@@ ify a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die him .
I cannot say , really objective to be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be other re@@ porter , to which you can apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you get from me , is what it is called to see a man an un@@ necessary death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man to mo@@ ist police @-@ tor@@ ch@@ ases to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt of a man from Perth , the police was successful , when he was in the sil@@ ky and sum@@ p@@ ages of water , only a few meters from a police officers , who tried to return him to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday at a home peace incident in pel@@ ham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not too much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I am not out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ fi@@ ve@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about it , therefore he turned a reliable tac@@ tics - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
master@@ ing soccer player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , Cou@@ sins drove his car into the tom@@ bs to go to a alcohol control , then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his efforts were successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins Bi@@ athlon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to finish him and threat@@ ens to finish the racing sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he aims at the ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria , and said that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai due to a racing day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing sports and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive Kob@@ old T@@ up@@ ing sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not take over 18 months because of the s@@ ion@@ age accus@@ ations , and did not want to see it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say nothing to say , and I have seen long , but sometimes they are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it is far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you re@@ acts , and you must live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will go at home today and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to go to the main head , and I want to think that my owner think that I try to try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they start to think , I do not do that I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I need to think what I do with my license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integration department had tried to minim@@ ize his barn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will be asked for information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe that I am an aton@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is the case , they should certainly take care of her n@@ oses , because they have failed to deal with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , Chairman of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of its time and are still alive today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should I bring it to the view that it will personally be personally ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has the RV@@ L celebrated behaviour , making people responsible outside of train@@ ers , which is in the industry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think that I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take me my license , and I have no doubt that what I say , they now think about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am now at the point , which is no matter of me , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise the pressure on them , and to meet them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the train@@ ers @-@ levels of the train@@ ers were built with the long cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to him that he can cast his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for the preparation of the un@@ imagin@@ able master of Black C@@ avi@@ ar , signed the rac@@ ite treatment rule , after a pack of mud or sound on the horse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to assume responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my staff has ir@@ cl@@ ed mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been such a day yesterday , what was so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three im@@ on@@ ati@@ fication dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack of the race day . a study of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who make these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man was arrested by driver
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a mer@@ ging with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver is arrested in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cyclists was delivered with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital , after having met by car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , the drivers continued to stop , without stop to help the last driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year old man made from Nath@@ alia to the police in She@@ pp@@ art@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is expected to be charged for driver and signed Hil@@ fel@@ ong power and due to other traffic del@@ etes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cyclists , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram remains in the hospital . it is in a stable condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes to fight ri@@ vals for ri@@ vals to Ring@@ ier
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League Favor@@ ites of N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator will have the Storm players &apos; ring competitions with his team during the high Storm @-@ victory in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett had a hardly link to the Storm Team , after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called the game , &quot; the Rug@@ by League and said that the two out of Que@@ ens@@ land did not be too good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ending the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said that she only focuses on her &quot; contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team will be confident , as it became worried that they are worried about the Storm Team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that always appears again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson about Ring@@ ier spoke , when she said to us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we have changed in our defective system or techniques in the last six weeks , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . it is probably not used to lose it , so it was a little shock for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is already strange as this is always up again for this season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds of his ment@@ or , that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening , and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team that can play and see it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play when one has this kind of players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as these . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build trust , because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it went around the Big Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ ingham also showed that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster showed a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or are breaks and do not have any points out ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they mention us , it means that we will continue to meet in one phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Storm team has freely received this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night at the next Saturday night . ticket sales starts from next service tomorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Serbia with 200.000 $ deposit to drug law
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man , which may cause a life sentence due to his test , in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were shot to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and put in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ accused in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police took 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a possibly life sentence for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that he tried to possess the whole lot , and that he could have been a harmless reason in the café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flanders , was worried about the floods at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Trial , he took the police on his residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had a damage deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together , to reach his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the detailed explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollar represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this alone will not be sufficient to stop him , not to appear , war@@ ned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against security , under the conditions that he reports his Australian and his Serbian passport , and at a starting point of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accident at A5 near Karlsruhe : driving cottage apart

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to attract p@@ est oph@@ ile to attract pictures
a p@@ est op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to call pictures of child abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept with an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him from another user . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ ar@@ ed her mother immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police k@@ iss@@ ed therefore , and saw the five pictures , analy@@ zes the five images that were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research , the terms of search for in@@ constant images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g said to the officials , that he would have done it to &quot; p@@ est oph@@ ile in the Internet , and then he gave him to be a polic@@ eman to be troubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Duma in E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , It would be a Su@@ cht , that he would be addic@@ tive , people too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave him that the search for the computer of him were done , but he said , unless he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his discussions with the unknown person who sent him , and asked him to send more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that he did it to attract them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , He is sick in the head when he drinks , and said , he will see images of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the phone , MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the lemon and the wines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , stated on 25 January of this year on 25 January this year , pleaded not guilty to a hearing on March 24th of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ en@@ ary attorney Gregor S@@ im bat therefore , that H@@ og@@ g doesn &apos;t appear in the register of sexual crimes , as you could be able to find no considerable sexual element in his way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael won the judgment of judgment until October to get background reports about social work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was still taken before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual criminal off@@ ences .
Schle@@ user soft on small border crossing to Germany
more refugees will be taken away from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many towing were made from fear of discovery and arrest , people increased to smaller bor@@ der@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Austrian side there was a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police Police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along the border of the border Inn , in the land of Passau and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn have been taken over 1000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were walking on foot over bridges and dust , to the German side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there they will be taken by Bundes@@ po@@ liz@@ ists in reception and transferred to registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Munich Central Station , following the German police data on Wednesday , again more refugees arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 8.00 alone , around 700 people have arrived at the capital capital , a speaker said in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stuttgart : er@@ unner of Trop@@ en@@ tower &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west
mete@@ or@@ ologists war@@ ns against storm in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a deep print over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful depth of the &quot; Henry &quot; , who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands in the past days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hot storms and storm are expected above all in Baden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to D@@ WD , it is still up to Thursday , even in the Black Forest , on the weak@@ ening Al@@ b and in the soil seek@@ ers with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday there is no longer the sun again .
&quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s : every two years show the car at the IAA at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , especially movement can be found in the compact car , which currently sell especially well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked : about 28,@@ 1 percent of the re@@ plac@@ ements fell according to the automotive Office ( KBA ) alone on this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence days 17th to 27 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept and new high @-@ quality cars and luxury cars will be presented primarily many new compact models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the largest pre@@ m@@ ists for the German car is the Opel Astra , which is in autumn with the dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; says Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the volume model is well sold well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel represents a entry below the largest passenger VW Golf in the view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only one @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the second variant will follow the combi , which is already visible at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what &apos;s next to the Astra at the IAA in front of the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra &apos;s competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively regarded as fifth in a conventional and a emphas@@ izes sporty GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the next year , he will also come as a combi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment by Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new model , the new model will be able to find its position in the strong growing segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the compact Infin@@ iti adapts to its curved lines fully integrated into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,0 liter turbo @-@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the maximum torque of torque is 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renovated is the compact model DS 4 , which is at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ ol@@ ers , especially hand on the front part : the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lamp with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the compact class , the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I were added to the IAA in the compact class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human un@@ worthy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court , the Federal Constitutional Court has given an Ex @-@ prisoners of Just@@ iz@@ ational Life Te@@ gel , which was placed in a small cell in a small cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of violation of its human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation when they are in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court in one of the order published on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the judges , they can even hope for money when they were only a few days in the narrow rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , a ex @-@ prisoners with his constitutional complaints in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in a single cell with around five square metres of ground floor ; the toilet was not separate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man , who is now on the right foot of his An@@ wal@@ ts , has been moved back into a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his counter@@ act liability due to the un@@ worthy conditions of liability against the land of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the constitutional judges took the judgment of the chamber Court Berlin , and rejected the case to rene@@ w the exam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they see the human dignity of man .
chamber Court now decides about the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if from legal reasons , there was only a few days of arrest for compensation for compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the legal protection of the personality would be afraid . &quot;
the chamber Court must now clari@@ fy the amount of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the constitutional complaints are often strengthened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they said only in April a prisoner , because he was imprisoned in a cell in a cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the majority of a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had a prisoner in a parallel fall in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former K@@ lä@@ ger was over three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karlsruhe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last weeks , the Berlin pr@@ isons were also come to the head@@ lines because of missing staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prisoners will therefore always be included 23 hours , which increases the aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to pun@@ ctu@@ ation , should be able to be pun@@ ished because of the respected situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to information of the Just@@ iz@@ pres@@ se@@ wer , 21 places are not occupied in Te@@ gel due to young people , 19 shall be removed from 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Justice in Germany , according to the statement of Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create this . &quot;
what comes to Germany in the following overview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to various forecasts between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Justice ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the pest@@ le @-@ Institute ) dwell@@ ings annually - and the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatic is the lack of living room , but especially with affordable rental objects : from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments are made from the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is the point of view of the pest@@ le Institute : 80 000 social apartments , and the covenant would have to invest a funding amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , scientists and Federal Minister , scientists have to give more control parts for investments in the housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates of the Institute for Labor Market and Professional Research , 55 percent of poul@@ try can be employed in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , refugees in Germany are not systematically asked to help them to help them by Claudia Walter , project management for integration and education in Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation in the recording industry , but also for self @-@ value of conc@@ essions , says Mig@@ r@@ oring Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , a political turn was given : from the work offered for refugees to recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the previous year , it was reduced to asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months as well as the Resi@@ den@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers is limited to a residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the journals - a majority of visibility , that refugees should be faster than access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
so far there is no longer available for general and commercial language courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , jobs will also show jobs by personal contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction of networks is therefore according to view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the Royal trail to work integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few loos@@ ely parents can give up their children into the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to convince the family , the advantages of the K@@ ita is distributed in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the demand should rise to refugees by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would increase to increase training capacity - by taking more professional schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students are prepared for students without German knowledge in the countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no need for them , says Be@@ ate St@@ und@@ ation of the Berlin School Management .
the German student work is estimated that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , no state asylum seek@@ ers or patient - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
study of refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce do not receive services after asylum seek@@ ers , if they begin studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter is basically not a BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , as they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ged@@ ul@@ able refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible to be eligible for BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G to be shortened from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this financing is also to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German student works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play an important role in future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should continue to develop the same rights , as they have the churches , and the existing state of churches to become a new state of religions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would also be important to the establishment of a Islamic welfare Association , who is professionally taking care of the curiosity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights belong to the right hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representative of Islam must work on clear contact person and be ready to work with the state in many fields and certain control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also belongs to will@@ ing@@ ness to go against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be worn in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to have such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately her right to stay here in Germany , he said in the Bavarian Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he struck the Basic Law to Arabic .
integration will be much more than today a theme of the whole society today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the majority company will have to change the majority of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany - as a result of European decisions - as a result of a decade , an anti @-@ discrimination office and a General Gender Equality Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is very slow to ignore the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ series , in the police and authorities systematically ignore the rac@@ ist motif . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ ran@@ ten@@ ders and stak@@ eholders non @-@ white German states have to remain in the next few years , if the land shall remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use - for the welfare of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , Germany in general , Germany is able to supply the expected refugees of medi@@ cally , with Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and Capac@@ ities are concerned , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the daily mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however they can flow out additional money into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks to avoid Mont@@ gom@@ ery in all occasions of registration health cards .
the services could be completed later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it was highly question@@ able to see many people with the limited performance catalog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the doctors make the doctors to create . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been detected , migrants are worse than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting interpre@@ ting expenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to many refugees , many refugees have been helped with more general medical assistance in the emergency patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugees , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people go to HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the partial other disease pictures , German doctors from their apprentic@@ eship as well , Mont@@ gom@@ ery Village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite diarr@@ ho@@ ea or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recognize . and what the doctors is concerned by refugees even relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed image system , some refugees be even doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to practice this , however , they would have to change their quali@@ fications and consider again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany , after estimates of the psych@@ otherap@@ eutic psychology ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ic sick : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially viol@@ ently , refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently published study of the TU Munich , that every fifth Syrian refugee was trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress , suffering from among others in so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respiratory , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further symptoms are sleeping and concentration disorders , strong shr@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent the symptoms of chronic , be an early treatment necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically sick refugees have received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although psychological sick asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for a psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they would not be trained in social workers or doctors that are not trained for psychological disorders , whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this often lead to mal@@ in@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; passion &quot; attacks the Circus Pro@@ bst to the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to draw every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal welfare and its unique entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the Man@@ ege on the bricks are to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine , without my cir@@ cus family , says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Animal teacher and Junior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ tra @-@ ins@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the gift to insp@@ ire the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take the people from their everyday str@@ ott and take them in a completely different world , emphas@@ izes the 27 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old junior locations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city fla@@ ir &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst of his concept .
50 towns on the barely 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this fla@@ ir .
the program of cir@@ cus convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family the audience with joke and charm in their spell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of St@@ um@@ m@@ films it wants to accommodate the Cuban duo .
lightness and flexibility - identify them with these words .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women in the storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascinated with finger@@ tips and joints . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to balance with the wheel on a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sna@@ ke people fascin@@ ate and troubled at the same time .
Wang L@@ in China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little other and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 articles from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family &quot; emphas@@ ises Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
abuse in the attitude of zir@@ cons are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst will also take the position : &quot; if it is not good , it &apos;s not good to us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four leg@@ ged arti@@ sts , as they are lovingly called , will be read after any wish of the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into Man@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the top Command@@ ment : good for the animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on your zeb@@ ra Jumbo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family is proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two animals lived in a skir@@ mish with eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little JUMBO is , &quot; tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the zeb@@ ra is still not ready for Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one is safe , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst invites to his performances from 17 to 20 , daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is family day for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the animal view is open daily from 10 am to 18 o &apos;clock .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , African leaders in the beginning of the year of a podium fell down the stairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ locked , but the video of the Falls spread rapidly beyond the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening of the Parliament also received anonymous death , that they were anonymous death and war@@ ned them to accompany the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , they had taken him out and interrupted him during his speech at the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions polit@@ ician sends SMS messages on their cell phones that they war@@ ned them to distur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she said the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that ends immun@@ ity in parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts with the services of the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this year , HP will split into two listed companies as well as the computer and printer business of its faster growing company hardware and service activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the restructuring measures will allow a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ president and Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ est portfolio of shops that support companies to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an independent company , we are better installed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US dollars and will be concentrated on the provision so far , integrated technology solutions for companies will be concentrated , as an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shares a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , and their Palo Alto garage one has called the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP has a massive restructuring , to overcome the return of traditional PCs to handle mobile devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field which is closely focused on a better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger fought against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it runs only September and if his rehabilitation will be in plan , no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and given its participation in the next summer at the European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had completed the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le injury , and then turned back to his old tail during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is threatened not the career . &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a larger matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in conjunction with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or injuries , which he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be true from pure medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognised , there is the associated risk of further injuries , always if a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study of Prime Minister In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five game times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wid@@ est picture for arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League Clubs , which have shown most vulner@@ able days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ etch , but Arsenal believe that an improvement in vulner@@ ability during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have to strengthen an an@@ tigen period , time , in which you have to strengthen your body and combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he is going through the way he earns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track at the upcoming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance , and need to keep the players who need a small break @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Arsenal are clear favourites , through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest en@@ rol@@ ment effect in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year it was 10 in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal moved the doctrine from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , with its management in his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it never worked at arsen@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stayed in 2006 very close to it , but on the other side I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are ambitious , but we are not iner@@ um@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy Show that grants us serious lessons about defects of defects
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in regard to the need for men , even more doub@@ ted than ever before the young men had become more than young men at a 15 @-@ year @-@ h@@ och . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the effort to start the problem announced the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ r ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a pe@@ p@@ oo@@ rest life ) 2015 as the year of man , the men who need to seek to search the culture when they need them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friendship is the heart of the heart to handle this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a current study conducted at more than 2,000 high @-@ school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms , that if the LEICA had a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who are non @-@ depres@@ sive , half a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course you have to have to have friends to work for friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the age of social media , communication with its focus on substance is often more important than a significant contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , lifetime and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by the domin@@ ating what psych@@ ologists , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently , money cannot buy happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which is called by interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hum@@ id of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents at the football gu@@ sts in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging from Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to any case , even if they are often back to explore completely their feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of the phone call it explained to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my list@@ ener for people who are depres@@ sive and self @-@ end@@ anger@@ ed , has really shown me clearly as the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the men who contact us , are often not able to speak with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old re@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a huge effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weak@@ nesses if you speak about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind if I try to offer long @-@ term control mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it clearly presents the little moments of defects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much my objective outer se@@ iter status on the phone can also help people in the eye , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely newly created setting , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even better if you can see in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to extract Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to go to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain des Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the prince park on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who finally brought a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead to Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes Paris a strong start against the Swedish Master , since it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the fourth quarter in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he started his career career in 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause our opponents and rela@@ xes , even if there are certain things we need to be perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regre@@ t it , that we did not have another or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold on its own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was cast out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last month of Manchester United States , the PS@@ G was taken over the next month of Manchester United States , when he moved to Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , who was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off came to reach this level with nine national players on the field and was excited by a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but except a shot of Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , the far to Kevin Tra@@ des P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they were little in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G itself gave himself sometimes on , with some mis@@ sil@@ ly and bad breath , not least in the first half alone , after Cav@@ ani had abandoned him after the rest@@ art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he had much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which was buried in the 5@@ 2nd minute by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second gate finally fell shortly after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the bast@@ ay@@ er achieved his six@@ teenth season , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic was raised a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this finished all thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent input of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could stop the end of the E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave to that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then we played only in the Swedish league that did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications are not sufficient . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola retired 2008 change to the FC Bayern
world and European Championship X@@ avi plays in Qatar since summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played in the FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times of Spanish Master , three times poker winner , three times Cup champion , two times a champion World Champion , two times European champion World Champion , two times a world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona and changed the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca ver@@ t X@@ avi , that he had already stood before the beginning of EM in 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won all that we didn &apos;t tell . &quot;
and that is also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took the FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi not changed
but the change did not come .
and the decisive man is working today for the German record champion : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract , and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP told me that I would not change , that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has touched me . &quot;
who knows how to run the 2008 / 2009 season with X@@ avi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the fourth quarter of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the grass , switch@@ able the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the triumph at the end of the Royal Palace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said , they are not needed behind the scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a result of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when this is the necessity of alternative perspectives and in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of show , &quot; secured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ lied , with bel@@ low un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , when the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian was paved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to think people to think about it - who is always the director of Harmony , &quot; said Brown initially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and it is a sp@@ ouse that is beaten by their white sugar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the Fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film , that their direction might give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion was broadcast@@ ed , the soci@@ etal media explo@@ des Miss@@ ons comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his rage on the clip , by he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can tell her diversity - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Twe@@ et has served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 L@@ ikes since its publication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ons comments come to a time , at the exact r@@ ass@@ ical representation in the media at the top of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement has been killed by a white polic@@ emen and authorities , dis@@ criminal practices against colour content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince of Prince made an attack on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ ums still matte &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums still have their importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in re@@ juven@@ ating time , the movement of the movement Black &amp; Mat@@ ter has published a declaration on the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a H@@ ass group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Black Sea Mat@@ ter is a love group . &quot; said the leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Dam@@ on was found on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , which are invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope , is un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ning first champion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition show , which just stopped their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants , which could close all levels of his obst@@ acle par@@ cours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the season fin@@ ales , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cameroon &apos;s Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last purpose , climbing a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ritten completed the task within the period , which he finished the first ath@@ lete , which ended the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it is amazing that I have never deser@@ ve more than 10,000 $ deserves or to life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his p@@ ile money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so suddenly .. how I can &apos;t imagine , how it is ... the future is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the producer K@@ ent WE@@ ED sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , although he finished the par@@ cours , not any prize money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alists , it receives the fastest time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said WE@@ ED . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like very the money is a wonderful price and life , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t believe that he is a g@@ roll .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of fans .
he is such a great guy and family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think that Isaac would have felt as well , when they would like the roles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an A@@ verage season that will start working in spring 2016 .
Detroit tiger grinding at Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , they were one of the best teams at Bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfect against the Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ wins won a chance to climb up in a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was difficult to touch over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger @-@ P@@ it@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support as Detroit , three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck for 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior and made three rings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year &quot; said Simon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to throw out every game every game , and therefore I want to enter into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the des@@ ig@@ ated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the first three hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6 July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he made the impact wood well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked good for ( percussion training ) , it looked much better in the bul@@ lock , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the in@@ ning with a double at the left field line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out , before he was replaced by the left @-@ left Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard@@ y over@@ ran wall , the only man , with whom he was confron@@ ted before the des@@ ig@@ ated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ impact man Miguel S@@ ano , which was a two @-@ run @-@ run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of lungs and the conclusion of the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the major league @-@ leading 27th time in this season , pl@@ ou@@ ffe a double Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth bottom , a R@@ BI double against the C@@ less of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , S@@ ano has three p@@ it@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit benef@@ ited to the start of the game from a not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three rings in the first two inside against the ro@@ g@@ ist veter@@ an , which was painted before the game of the injury list , after having made a back more than a month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning , whom I wished , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt I felt and felt that I would create some good P@@ it@@ ches because in the third in@@ ning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game when he tried to get the third threat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers laid in the second , a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has not tried particularly well , but he has caught the right spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think that not think about military options may not take place without Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he cast the European states &quot; collective directions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , you have been happy that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends before our front door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Washington , the former German Ambassador in Washington also called a massive increase of international assistance to refugees for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls south and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has introduced its controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on the service evening on the Austrian television station ORF , according to Hungary also no one is sent back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Germany did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is as agreed , &quot; explained it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to question a certain number of refugees from Austria , a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , I have given these discussions between the General Director of Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures she didn &apos;t called them , and looked forward to convers@@ ations on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) , and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU state and government officials have a special summit for next week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany started on Sunday with a temporary border control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the EU states have not been able to go on a joint advance in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new application for binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the covenant will support countries with the first recording and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the covenant will come together with the countries of man@@ agen , announced Merkel at the late service evening after almost four hours of consultation with the Prime Minister in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people , protecting the protection against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but who does not have any lead in Germany could not remain in Germany .
this view was divided into the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor stressed , the state as a whole , now a huge force of force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees have been stuck in the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia in the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours on it announced the government in Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this neighbour land is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wool who sought to have different routes over Romania said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new Grenz@@ z@@ au@@ n .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were first verses of people who had crossed the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , a real estate of further migrants will report on the way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the moon , the moon is easily reached on its rail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this diving movement is only small , but nonetheless too big for a continuous body body , it is called in a message of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers put their analyses at the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; in front of the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cream of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , Cass@@ ini had discovered ice cream at the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ moon , the water vap@@ or and ice particles , so that the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of the Saturn can feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole there will be a underground sea at least the astronom@@ ers back then .
but the expansion of the hidden ocean was not yet clari@@ fied .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but who wants to respect his slim line , which is often not recommended by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ osis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. mainly contain Mang@@ os but much vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta @-@ car@@ otene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports visual strength , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or to be firm and pleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sh@@ en@@ color alone does not say about how ripe the fruit is - so , green man@@ os can taste delicious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should store at room temperature and should be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure pure or sweet dishes .
a M@@ ango also gives warm dishes a special touch .
they made the slightly bitter taste of man@@ holes like Chic@@ ore@@ e and radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poul@@ try , lamb and wild .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and night in the night to Thursday , the hair falls partly with storm strength . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on Thursday morning , a distinctive cold front , the strong rainf@@ alls , wind ar@@ ches and a temperature backwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like mete@@ or@@ news in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British islands in a strong southern West flow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the night@@ stand , the night breaks through the valleys through the valleys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the consequence , the hair dryer up to Thursday morning in the fro@@ gs with goats of 60 to 100 km / h , compatible and especially in the jungle land also with more than 100 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hair dryer can be set up until the adjacent middle and v@@ ord@@ ship , and on the mountains are even Or@@ kan@@ ar@@ ches of over 120 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the north on Wednesday , my hair dryer in the north on Wednesday , temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is rain one that holds up to Thursday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , south of the Alps to the next 48 hours with partly over 100 litres of rain per square meters , this must be fallen in the last few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning , the hair falls off the air , in the succession a cold front with strong , partly covered rain from West to East over Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the cold front f@@ ris@@ eth the wind heavily up to stor@@ my , and the temperatures are far back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin Luther square in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of the city President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino was baptised to the name of the German reform@@ ators on Wednesday , on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now called &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Colos@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Protestant Churches of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , parish of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remembered that the Protest@@ ants were often able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the place will be visible in symbolic way , that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome be welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held in Rome as young August@@ ine of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt and the city then commented on sin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his negative impressions thirst him after view of histor@@ ians in his later fight against Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Luther , Luther had led his thes@@ es against Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del the split of the Even@@ ing Church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with magnificent images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and f@@ anci@@ ful shapes , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective topics can be adjusted in the opposite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project , for which he made an subjective artistic selection from the many topics of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cycles are cycles , which are subject to topics such as crosses , commandments , commandments or pat@@ ernity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he has fascinated spont@@ ane@@ ously several partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , which has based on painting with the respective Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible , and so in today , in recent meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror from Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nestled between Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his personal thoughts on the respective situation here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emotions were ultimately born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who heard the strict Protestant mist@@ ress Order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education came with the pipe , &quot; reminds Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work to work for me , maybe even with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help art in faster , art in faster time to help : &quot; the perception of images is influenced today and is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sym@@ bo@@ lik is going to be ur@@ ged .
artists have a different desire and W@@ onne to show things .
pictures always have a little secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to leave the viewer to look at the pictures , they feel , discover and feel that power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost and on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art , &quot; I like it , how he can live with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old did not consider it to capture the Bible , but also selected for him important , mysterious themes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it goes to the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ il from the Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to find his life in deep and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for mixing both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screens - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn na@@ p
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans made , place , had been commissioned to set up companies for a round course : one year later , almost everything was finished - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ dens@@ ities in politics and administration , especially with the residents who did not want to know the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so hills down up , new place sought - now with a formal planning and application for building permit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will go down in October , the first council in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to communicate in the child and youth committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when working with the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help with the help of increasing problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no man to say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to do , I have nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every single , this topic in the handle , &quot; says DF@@ B boss Wolfgang kidney s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday at the Chancellor and meet the State Minister of Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the subject will play a central role , he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soccer can help and wool .
but the decisive woman must represent the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German football Federation therefore has expanded its refugees &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome to four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we managed that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; explained kidney s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some federal states support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already at this weekend , the 36 pro@@ filed a significant sign if they are on the left tri@@ cot@@ t@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) will help the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure that all help , where and how they can only help , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama is definitely going away . nobody can see away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football federal states , no , we have to use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees , who already have so amazing , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ im@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the EM @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women 100 refugees invites for Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
kidney s@@ bach was the support of refugees as &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that all 36 licens@@ ing has been launched in their places , be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so great is that small and smallest verses are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome , which we spent , is lived in the football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and the next year , the association represents 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the whole sum for 2015 is already called , he reported kidney s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Chairman loses an eye for accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports by a fall of July the left eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen after midnight on a water glass , which he carried on the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blo@@ od@@ d , he was born on the road - which he has told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so plate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager be at the meeting , and &quot; fully unemployed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will return to Germany again and continue to guide software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m fully for SAP because full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I stood the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman Has@@ so plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to go to the public , with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; anyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again if you like . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he therefore comes in Singapore on weekends as well as a Reser@@ ves for the two pedi@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of Europe league are final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national player is missing the table leader of the football Bundesliga with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o &apos;clock / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can not return on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga Top@@ game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ B Coach is open again : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the high load of his professionals Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem eleven only on the Re@@ us position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus he announced a change at the Tor@@ hil@@ ter@@ position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place the place of stem keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at a absolute top level &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher training the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europe league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will also take the second game with high probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ warding statement of Mit@@ player Re@@ us , that the final report for the Bv@@ B in the Europa League , holds middle field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l , so that Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think that we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
rob@@ otic cars : government wants to re@@ iter@@ ate role in Germany
Germany is supposed to be the government of the government of the car technological pioneer after the will of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Office decided on Wednesday a strategy paper out of the house of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in expanding digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automated and networked driving will increase the traffic safety and ensure less st@@ ems , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the topic with his ministers from the G7 states , who also come together with representatives of industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strategy paper of the traffic Ministry emphas@@ izes among others , the importance of the mobile broad@@ band out@@ building and an excellent change on digital audio radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the testing of new technology currently generates a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to check the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; will check the Federal Government of the legal framework and to adjust where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , Germany will develop around internationally , that the permissible top speed is raised for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to use the Federal Government for a change of the Vienna Convention , so far only the people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automated driving takes over the car the car , the driver will more and more to the passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process the data in seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to one of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving is possible to be technically possible by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles on public roads are expected to expect only far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors estimate the study by 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic sp@@ ol@@ iti@@ ker S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question of liability for accidents and safety of personal data from the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one on Wednesday at the AA survey of the For@@ sa @-@ Institute in order to continue that only eight percent of the Germans believe that there are only eight percent of the Germans in the coming ten years , 31 percent do not believe that 31 percent do not believe it at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 with aut@@ on@@ om driving cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave , completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of the digital verb@@ ands B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would vote for control throughout the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the highway , we could present 15 percent in flowing traffic , at the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well every v@@ owed would leave the control under any circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the final decision shall fall at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ head Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the draw@@ back , we are no longer a clear favorite , &quot; stated single @-@ European Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the network list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but remember the EM 2013 in Schwe@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo , Timo has also been found , and we became the European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate us , stated the world @-@ tran@@ scri@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels at old for a en@@ f@@ ant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a mixture of large fashion show and a juni@@ per @-@ gr@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins which look great thanks to video projec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French design , which was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he was able to mount men in skirts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say that I am the f@@ im@@ ant of Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , it was very light , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the citizens of the hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung ) , it is a luck that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pfer has changed his start to a show about his person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he had been in contrast , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a bit after death , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you dies to the museum you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had already been made in Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it go to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibits give an insight into that &apos;s unlikely work , the fashion history has been written without ever a training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographer for which much effort was operated : for example a Styl@@ ist was engaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 tons of material , the makers according to the &quot; Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot according to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the start of the October , it was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather outfit with cor@@ s@@ ett . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are weak as men , ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old te@@ ddy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ious mo@@ m away from the design .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child ( he was not a good student , and bad in the football ) he attracted his te@@ ddy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was able to throw out fashion later , later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designer , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later I bought the then of course .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the models .
they got nothing but could not keep the clothes .
jewellery instead Gard@@ ins - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , it went to the long embro@@ idery machines in and around Pl@@ auen , to make a meter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips were produced in great amount for customers that they worked for example , ceilings and curtains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ wers Pl@@ auen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning of the pl@@ au@@ ener tip , fashion played a larger role , then it was re@@ discovered by the home textile industry and is now re@@ discovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : tip in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and for regional traction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which re@@ jects itself to the past stil@@ ts , an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who is not served in the textile industry in Germany no more on the market .
with us they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ ck sitting Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embro@@ idery .
only they may bear the protected label .
around 80 percent of the turnover be broken down in the last 15 years .
private shops and wholesale there are almost no longer .
our products can hardly achieve our customers in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass ware is cheaper nowadays in the Asian region , and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the export of export , currently in Russia and the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we introduce a quality of quality that we are ecological and soci@@ ally toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the used materials . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the University of Z@@ wick@@ au University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es on stick@@ ers and tips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to determine the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a voltage range between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies which must think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , an existing design is often slightly varied to hold a customer base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some years ago animated Text@@ ildes@@ ign Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic snow tip .
the machine embro@@ i@@ dered the machine at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ se , the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith was inspired by them : &quot; before I was able to start with traditional pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the s@@ nail tip for their jewelry .
they marked the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of pl@@ au@@ ener - young and old . &quot; says Re@@ uter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supplies in the US , to Australia and Finland - mainly to customers , whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and its surroundings , and that would like a reminder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I see my jewelry as modern ambassador of Pl@@ au@@ ener .
Disney planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; Film
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; le@@ gends should not stir in le@@ gends , but Disney feels like a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , according to the &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; however , it is not a kind of continuation , but in order to play a kind of continuation which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement a negative list is created , sectors and companies identified , which do not occur in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system will be tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance , as it has a major role in the access of resources , which guarantees an illegal business field and the market said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also make controls over the companies over@@ bearing the companies and ensure that the company will decide how they lead their shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners , a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; to apply by the requirements and the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and professional judges and state lawyers , was also engaged in a session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double the mercury limit in space @-@ fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large cat@@ fish and consum@@ es a significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is critical in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side effects failed with full of Wu@@ er@@ ers and infants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the bound@@ ary values of the nerve chain is supposed to be raised by one of two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , big noise @-@ fish are already so strong with mercury , that on the basis of the current limit values about 50 percent of the length may not be sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be inde@@ xed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to cross the limit values in other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch did this but as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , such as car@@ p is usually loaded so low to hold the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the ab@@ dic@@ ation at Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore a per@@ fi@@ ance of the pul@@ leys , that helps the economy alone , declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is one for the people of highly toxic heavy metal that is strongly influenced by the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Federal Government war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low amounts especially when un@@ born harm of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment explained on his homepage on his homepage , but that a &quot; health end@@ an@@ gering of the general population is not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury occurs mainly through the coal burning in the environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of Environmental Affairs , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck spent more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish around in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube be more permanent and nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mirror &quot; was cited in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , European war@@ nings before mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
