Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of international agreement and Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in peace process .
&quot; through the deal of Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two further deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election of the election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , who shot his girlfriend shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he shot his girlfriend and had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b was very important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officers found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that was set on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled over 300 miles to the school grounds where he was shot and killed by the police . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tk@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lam@@ b had made the deser@@ ted emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took the life when the police took him . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting in the university , students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motivated . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators on both ends of the State published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were fre@@ eing on his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said , he has no history of violence or a criminal background . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in one of his written book , in which he told the &quot; wonderful people &quot; to whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both sub@@ stituted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching bodies are 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some n@@ eig@@ ns for problematic behaviour . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lam@@ b , said , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
Lam@@ b previously asked the Delta State University to provide evidence for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; in this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the employment policy of the University , meant that the promotion for the Lam@@ b had worked hard for him , for him no guarantee for an automatic way to an adjustment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that can &apos;t answer the Lam@@ b .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , police later found Lam@@ bs track when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he was arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents house at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said they believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; Lam@@ b began his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 when she met her friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was at the time of women &apos;s black men .
&quot; all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on lived . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lam@@ b said , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that borders to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had been divor@@ ced for 15 years , but friends stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he came and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago , both on a summer market . &quot;
later they played together one or another gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes Entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time , after Lam@@ b had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica . &quot;
there was no evidence that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and sh@@ aken each other together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of joke . &quot;

&quot; this story has been corrected to resist that the police now says that Lam@@ b had shot the emergency call after he was shot , and that Lam@@ b had been shot in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there was no indication that the two were ever married . &quot;

8 changes that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in two @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the electoral period . &quot;
no claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , one of which was not only a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but external groups like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ umps penetration and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current trends that suggest that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Any@@ thing values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump noted his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
* Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noticed that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in a survey of CNN / the last week 67 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say , they would be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 per cent , which say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the establishment , the candidate would be . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bomb@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Republican voters believe that the real temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent that he did not have the personality to effectively manage his office , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not pass into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters get acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they put their money back , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CNN / the last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July their money on J@@ eb Bush put their money on J@@ eb Bush .

&quot; at that time , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost every one . &quot;
some experts suggest that the sp@@ lit@@ tered field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ umps leadership during the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ us .
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University beginning September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a kn@@ ack majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say that they have formed their mind .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T shows that only something more than half the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have for@@ given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course it can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps &apos;s strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump was in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; was the immigration revol@@ t and fishing point in public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bomb@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial Hez@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be remote from the Republican Party and damage the new @-@ orient@@ ated efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post poll , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump with questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration is remaining in the ra@@ mp light , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s on new high@@ s .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially by their external leader status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they want to prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot; &quot;

&quot; a happy reading of Thomas Müller , the FC Bayern , the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ akos Pir@@ äus - then ran it . &quot;
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have received a dream start in the &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of train@@ ers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their launch game in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ akos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth star@@ ters in series should be the first step towards final final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; Müller received the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership , Roberto , who left one as a f@@ lange of the world champion . &quot;

they showed a concentrated and committed idea to shine .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the King class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ous , but with their obvious efforts , however , they often go to work on work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by playing on left @-@ outside Douglas Costa , who rarely came through the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck than his flan@@ ks out of the right half @-@ field in the left corner of the corner .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as Olympi@@ akos @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown proposed the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ed with the knee ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;

&quot; after the final training , the World Cup hero was given green light after the final training , said &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; who wants something else to do this is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the first shift , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the proposed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; it was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made 13 minutes later everything clear . &quot;

&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; the competent EU commission@@ er Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström explained . &quot;
the Swedish government decided to introduce the proposal as a European negotiation position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone of the world will be created with 800 million people . &quot;

&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is expected to be the debut of the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the question@@ naire of the Prime Minister , and to create himself for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise in order to place the first of its six pre@@ ached questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because it comes after his appointment to the member of the shadow cabin and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony at the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several Tit@@ els@@ grund Stories . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has attracted attention to himself &quot;
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six@@ ths of the parliam@@ entar@@ ist party originally supported him as a guide . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within the Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements to the position of the European Union and the limitation . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are set to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister , that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another political approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the leader of the prime minister is to conc@@ ede , and that he has under@@ lined both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ cken with resistance and to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality , and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the sub @-@ house , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was born in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was able to remove himself from the politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theater &quot; . &quot; but some years later he became one that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since she has been broadcast on television first in 1990 , the question@@ naire was considered to be the most important Bar@@ ometer of the Ur@@ part of a leader and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus and his position among his parliam@@ ents , although critics argue that she has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms . &quot;

this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens its 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA and revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost roughly 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ amor@@ pho@@ sis loses market shares in the East states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent poll of Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and food business around 3,@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2015 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 % by 2020 . &quot;

&quot; it is a matter of which I rather spend on myself , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost it in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has to behave in the US Open extremely well , even under the pretty provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves it to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not on all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;

&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declar@@ es not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ dden the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all the parties trying to stop illegal in the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence fled to an unknown time in a landing strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose up .
&quot; as a police helicopter over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian deploy@@ ments . &quot;
some meadows from protest food and water are back .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister said it was unacceptable that migrants from Hungary would come back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; it must take place in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block in Brussels no common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the corrupt Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be possible that the EU countries would have more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a balanced action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation in two southern regions , authorities reported more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a barb@@ ed dra@@ h@@ tz@@ el along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East have become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and to the input point in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insisted that most of the coming business refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , who left the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected to be expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;

&quot; the former US Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to continue a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her towards the ground . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who still won &apos;t announce whether he is can@@ di@@ ted for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are available in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News poll , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big advantage for women and the rest , but these origins have dimin@@ ished . &quot;

about half of the democratic voters of the local elections say that they would support Clinton if it would be nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some advance and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .

forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters in an open question will be asked why they want the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman President will be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is mentioned . &quot;
consent to the handling of the problems and the ability to be cited are also quoted .
&quot; since the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see it in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons followers say more than half , that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ di@@ fy the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead is far ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race at 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this number of 78 per cent in the last month fell . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elect@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , there is no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters in the elections as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results in some important features in choosing the election of their party .
&quot; multi@@ tudes consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;

&quot; in general , democratic voters see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an external minister , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions are not affected altogether . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died when a student has died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which has contributed to his death . &quot;

&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ ache , then he fell in mind . &quot;

&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s clothes to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the members of U@@ ten@@ sils began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in general above that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Wagner . &quot;

this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; a interest rate is coming , and the house will get into the w@@ rest@@ ling , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know .
&quot; what we do not know is how long it will take , and how long it will be . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor of how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank strongly emphas@@ ise that investors should not concentrate on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low level to lead to sei@@ sm@@ ic shock , to cause many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there is no effect . &quot;
here is one of the historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , interest rate increases things for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase comes , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets income 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might be reflected again the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what has happened after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle cycle , and the return will begin to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not be able to accelerate the recession . &quot;
&quot; it is extremely remarkable , that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in an interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; market participants have taken the whole year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;

&quot; in our study , all ero@@ sion cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing swing in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ ouses very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; so the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in case of bonds , the ren@@ di@@ tes seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering in the cycle is carried out . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the cycle cycle , the bond came immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer and shorter bond between longer and shorter bonds .

&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income curve is flat , banks have wi@@ dened and the vol@@ atility has risen - all characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed increased its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the big and whole , companies that make the larger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt are worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive and the financing of their debt . &quot;

Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the Kra@@ n accident - Bin Laden family is anch@@ ored
the bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Sau@@ dis bin Laden group to load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered together , when 29 of the victims were carried out by the streets to bury those who were killed when a cra@@ dle of Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; the first of the dead , the first of the dead , came to the Al @-@ Mo@@ vi@@ ve cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went on to the Holy Site , where only days before a building crane came through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king passed over the construction company of Bin Laden because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane was stor@@ med by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca , with thousands who continue to come to the city will continue . &quot;
&quot; today König Sal@@ man said , the bin Laden group would not steal the arm of the crane than he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arab version of the decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was banned abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man fell to reveal what was caused by the fall of the crane that collap@@ sed into a courtyard of the Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place in this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group has no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ad@@ eth the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of forces surround Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project which is led by the Bin Laden group .
&quot; since decades , the Bin Laden family has been associated with the mist@@ ress family of Saudi Arabia and takes over major construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a young son who was kidn@@ apped by the family in 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for pilgrimage , which is at least once in life of any healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .

the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them was indic@@ ted because of the ministers of the ministry .
&quot; in May , he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May . &quot;
the current process was negoti@@ ated .
&quot; according to the Attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel , Robert Ri@@ ffel had discovered that the def@@ endants were allowed in 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , used for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On February 17 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted due to financial failures .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; for the creation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence was that the association was not a part of an asset . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , Pas@@ si@@ va had invested some 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( R@@ d . 44@@ 0,000 ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : do we lead the club further or lock it ? &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the bread @-@ based large @-@ level audi@@ tor of the financial officer . &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ workers .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have proposed money to put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money , it may not be made any debts . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the financial success , the down@@ payment of the allow@@ ance damage has been decided until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the conversion is not paid for years later , namely the year 2003 when a plus was paid on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Pau@@ l@@ - and not detail bookings seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings books managed by the two accused , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association had not been exposed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial geb@@ ar@@ ation , it is important to be the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;

&quot; this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; &quot; damages &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; with whom you are all from the tailor . &quot;
&quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the function@@ ary , he never had a cent of salary , he spent only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , he added to the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years were unable to advance the def@@ endants .
&quot; these are according to a operating test , in which everything was considered correctly , they declared them . &quot;
the second def@@ endant was also accused of the second accused .
&quot; according to his statement , he stated in his statement . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world is observed when the US staff on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , comes together to meet the important decision whether the first time has been raised up for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will have a little longer , and interest rates on the current status of 0 - 0.25 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest was on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Chief of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook of global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances are good against such a step . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday .
death of Death at the Delta State University
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning , and before he was killed by his colleagues , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that it was &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted to make it &quot; &quot; he could not make it &quot; , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lam@@ b , lect@@ urer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot someone and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the police officer said that the police officers had to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m shocked at my wife yesterday evening , and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; but is likely to be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the An@@ ru@@ fer to his name , but he didn &apos;t have him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police took the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State University where he took E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced for 15 years ago , but were friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , which is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed in the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lam@@ b gave relatives at a certain time on Monday to say , &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lam@@ b drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , and killed himself with a shot . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play monthly
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
&quot; during this , Louis van Ga@@ al is hoping to play at least six months of playing games , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a backward attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was embedded into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought into the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; &quot; He has a double leg and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
&quot; in the locker cabin , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape from a red card and the hanging of a penalty meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al pres@@ sured that the Italian arbit@@ rator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;

&quot; if a player with this type of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it is not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad violation , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so that it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .

surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it &apos;s a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book decided to be the prime minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead of adding an contents of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel lau@@ ded and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if the text is not susp@@ icious enough : the story of Cameron &apos;s text is partly reads as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is being presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is there to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron &apos;s action is so little familiar . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row of a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text would probably have come from Camer@@ ons &apos;s electoral office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan , the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res , the England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in Batt@@ ing installation , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test plane , is an option for attack . &quot;
&quot; in this message , Adam Ly@@ th will fail from the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ players are based on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark when Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - players have their own best choice . &quot;
&quot; long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out further gaps for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not have such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time is a test stroke to set his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to go home and down@@ ward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that you can raise , was that England initially sat at Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in the top form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; he is an X factor cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; it must be at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of making Mo@@ een next to Cook what an extra @-@ spin bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ cks would receive , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ player of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een has perhaps not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
&quot; he has managed three hundred races , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has very impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders that lift their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful application to setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with the previously thought . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used in the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you have to think that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions will not be taken lightly in heart .

France François Hollande looks on his re @-@ election or its release in 2017 .
he is also a burned force .
&quot; in Poland there may soon be a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will be able to tear a leg to help the sel@@ fie British to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar tendencies have different tendencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even be clearly not helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s lecture campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the re@@ trial . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ cally the Fle@@ et Street can be on their cost , and which EU scep@@ tics the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one is , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 years . &quot;
&quot; in all his los@@ ers , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone chi@@ ckens , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ domestic countries , which most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Tony Blair thought about her , but realized that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he was opposed to Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle of the un@@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which then opened a back@@ door . &quot;
&quot; the press has never left him , too . &quot;
&quot; but the cute Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a kind of cl@@ aps on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he had no time for me to hurt me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ he years , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position in Europe is - I pres@@ ume it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ arb@@ ases and the wil@@ dest plu@@ mage of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father himself tried to lay il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet , without losing too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , even what J@@ C told his fellow journalists and MPs after all reports on the Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touched bot@@ tom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n , remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and in front of all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the presentation campaign for a matter of matter how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in accordance with its Benn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left @-@ left dis@@ sident , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to NATO , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C has no campaign to exit the exit - will try to find foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin need political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something that British Influ@@ ence Security Forum was called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report by Public Health England via E @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
PH@@ E published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily w@@ indi@@ ge basis &quot; was founded on the PH@@ E . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write about BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; are based on a detailed review of the follow @-@ up and the modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to introduce their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained how to obtain funds from an E @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received according to the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champions , from which some also indicate a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of PH@@ E also took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; stri@@ ves &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; said McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
&quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes serve as a way for smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that the claims of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted beforehand . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smokers die in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that the health risks of e cigarettes in comparison are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to information about the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ .000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear demonstration of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage that is caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for providing publicly @-@ legal programs that likely be seen from a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not have a good idea for a good idea , you should at least give up its production at least on programs that do not make or be commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , given both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I am tired to see how this is public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC blame on hunting for reviews &quot; because the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC show that the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they meet their tasks , and they can argue if they have created their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we created all these tools that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one wanted to see them ever .
&quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all of us think that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that is true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it was supposed to change the public @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of TV shows are shown , and with the commercial Senate Alliances to make everything online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ ire change the direction of the moment in which they can be radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by frac@@ tures of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ ds change the direction of the moment , in which they have high frequencies for the human ear to have high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
impul@@ ses work by switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , which can be used in ultrasound , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impul@@ ses into the brain of humans to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; F@@ aden@@ worms are usually not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bladder , found out , rein@@ force the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ onic channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these I@@ onic channels , and activate the cells they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ ds , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ onic channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when he uses ultr@@ asonic to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied through the micro@@ b@@ ushes and transferred into the worms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent into the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin production cells , added . &quot;

&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , delicate company advertising , but &quot; through the flowers with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ pen the awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Amnesty . &quot;
what we need now is a move of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illegal in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for life in student residence homes
&quot; 11 years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ sed smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
&quot; if you have any questions , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell you where you come , whether and where you have sab@@ bath year , where you are standing in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it len@@ ders the conversation and helps you to figure out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you don &apos;t speak , even when your lashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks recipes , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract themselves and their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , do not think about the university with a relationship . &quot;
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a Refu@@ gi@@ um , but many student residence homes form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ bo@@ mel culture that can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you have to go away so that I have consumed the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a coma is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ p : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
for friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you begin to start the university on the cli@@ max of back man@@ ia , the clo@@ ves of the doors of people in order to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to do with you . so , and now please smile if I have a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats offer a good way to close friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ate feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; bad mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you arrive . &quot;
&quot; to steal food , there is a common crime in student residence . &quot;
&quot; of course , the cla@@ p of chi@@ ckens is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of lac@@ tic for your tea ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to themselves themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your things , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added their milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; they should not make any noise , the people of sleep or from work . &quot;
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my Fl@@ ur asked her neighbours , if there was something to make a drum &amp; bass , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she had to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut up her door and got up to her three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future partner would move into the same student residence ?
&quot; in the other way , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage , and to see them every day and maybe to experience how they move all the common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your under@@ garment a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his keys in his non @-@ resol@@ ute room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good shot is funny , but it takes only moments until he gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
do you share a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but don &apos;t miss the room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and put your keys into a glass of water , which you will then place in the freezer - but you don &apos;t want to put their pos@@ sessions on the blanket no more than twice . &quot;

&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass transportation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .

&quot; in view of the refugee power , we need enough space for the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ raced house needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different when people bring people into homes .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each living unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are lifted up at our south border , &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to ask for asylum could also be &quot; of course &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; it is clear whether it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , also not about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; - Slovenia &quot;
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel abroad in the direction of Austria and Germany , and also to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; as the border with Croatia , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to defend its borders for refugees but not to be abra@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried to leave the first refugees in the night hours to Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to so@@ ak the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik always hits police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country deals with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses made from Pres@@ evo to the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade refuses to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d were expected , in the course of the day more buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were the whole night of around 500 kilometres away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has done , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could actually be expected to come from observers already scheduled displac@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .

&quot; in order to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ en@@ gen@@ platz , it will lead to severe checks to qualify for membership in the space area . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners face a good testimony , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Greek side behind the Hungarian border fence , there continues to be about 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm the debate about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be difficult to deal with very high refugee figures .
&quot; one cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers urge migrants to - dangerous - Alternative items
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute stamps on which alternative routes are recorded through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are 20 years after the end of the Croatian border , there are still no more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent in the border region . &quot;

&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ parall@@ eled third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentives due to the unprecedented rate of short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;

&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus about what the F@@ ed will do what is contaminated by the financial market itself .

&quot; this indicates a decline of the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate , unless the strateg@@ ists promise the beat by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average value of 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or at 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift up the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get in panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a interest increase would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; even before one month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set of 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow slow@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that would require more economic progress , an increase in the pro@@ position . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improving the labour market in this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the Lev@@ els , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation is constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world sent to the end of last month after China had its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % under its maximum level , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would increase global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , whereby the Dow is now about 10 % below the Ho@@ ch of May . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would not have occurred in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
now he tells us that she will be waiting at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; in 2013 , Ben S. Bern@@ anke said that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly connected with each other , they can not only monitor the developments in other places , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , unanim@@ ously Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , intended for a interest in interest in the years 1998 / 1999 , as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its Leit@@ z@@ ins around 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions despite limited recogni@@ zable impact on growth in the US , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability on the first place during a serious crisis like the market crisis in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come to the proximity of this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; they will certainly not want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of an interest rate , because the markets continued , &quot; P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be fores@@ een . &quot;

Brazilian Bag@@ di@@ at@@ rical Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian Bag@@ di@@ at@@ rical Organisation Spr@@ S tries to clarify how important good nutrition during pregnancy is important . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to mothers . &quot;
&quot; a current study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ors . &quot;
unfortunately an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system .

and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar panels .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ looking mill building on the Bern@@ ri@@ eder sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent community meeting , the completed construction contract was carried out without big discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the committee had adopted a proposal on a structural &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; of the valid plan plan . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; should be erected with non @-@ mit@@ able first and roof @-@ roof@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; liberation &quot; in turn , in turn , went to the roof pitch , which is prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the building plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan for the roof is no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ ri@@ eder Joint Council generally tend to restri@@ ct restri@@ ctive contracts . &quot;
&quot; it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sport@@ zentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and bread@@ th sports .
&quot; in the next step , the building contract for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the property office . &quot;

&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come on Monday to Austria was without great work , &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad was charged with a need of 85@@ .000 quart@@ ets in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , the next few weeks have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries , 15,000 of the co@@ ven@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already led talks with the provincial governor .
these would have secured him to create Qu@@ arti@@ ere for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it is good , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; in the morning , a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;

&quot; on the platform , private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for lodging as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in emergency times , it may not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers must hold a certain height of the towel holder or size of the upper light . &quot;

Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic no cost as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; so far , its own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ Search was not yet successful . &quot;

Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; for now , no opening of urban sports hall and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning to plan the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is not necessary to be able to supp@@ ress the people without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their pi@@ ety . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the number of refugees in the United States and the United States will not be able to take part in this country . &quot;

the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; new Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; is officially concluded in the Lin@@ zer industry line . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in the IT are the smart heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T Chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; as a result , there are profiles of leading retailers , with analysis of their performance and the challenges they face . &quot;
&quot; from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the building is desp@@ ised by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of space in the building are already rented , for more than 40 per cent . &quot;

&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which they are sold under bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , all around the ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , Money Stock are from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger bags and accessories costs up to € 500 .
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot;
&quot; previously , several weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; I have been thinking about whether I want to open a shop , &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; it is crucial for the decision , among other things that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home are at home , from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only one in the big hall of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot;

&quot; why so , some woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ ental equipment , can also answer the specialist woman with last safety . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because there is a beautiful bag every outfit .

the Pf@@ äl@@ zer &apos;s ancestors from Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called an@@ en@@ ician .
this property links some also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether it is alien@@ ated from foreign , journalists , or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office h@@ ates the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts well .
&quot; this will also be registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ an K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate market have come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the com@@ promis@@ cu@@ le is a term for many in the win@@ zer@@ dorf at the Wein@@ straße .
some of the 1200 inhabitants of the 1200 inhabitants have been related to him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned out a film about Tr@@ ump .
&quot; and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man of the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think that is somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has turned an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ ints , along with Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure where you &apos;re getting your info , but I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re looking for , but I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re looking for . &quot;
&quot; for the king of the heart , he has not brought it there . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;

&quot; so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of An@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a local restaurant for gold gra@@ ves . &quot;

&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of logic : their desire to return to the homeland , failed to return to the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not have Tr@@ ump , because he once believed without permission , the director of the Institute for Pot@@ tery History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of follow @-@ up .
&quot; this was repeated repeatedly by Mexican immigrants in the United States , and demanded the construction of a border wall to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; it is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relationship tr@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans more dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; he is always so angry . &quot;
do you believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; this can &apos;t imagine me , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never dre@@ amed of K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the Pen@@ sions@@ wir@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t imagine myself from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; it has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the time of his grandfather in the US would have been so as he , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;

&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;

&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain bike village &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;

&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators . &quot;
&quot; critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; the result of yesterday evening , this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and suggested slightly The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; the first half of the hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe in average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half an hour ( 17 : 30@@ am to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will agree to Nine @-@ confident that hot @-@ seat will ultimately succeed at 17 : 30 .

&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was finally covered in the greatest secret life . &quot;
&quot; and no of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up , whether they are the one who received the last rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we with Sarah Mack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two are checked , you may have acci@@ dentally put a note on who will be the winner . &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; all three women have left themselves in ly@@ rical ways , why Wood is the perfect man and knew his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; you could destroy their answers to the game , who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki were both quickly - except himself - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house , and I noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that they were quite compatible , and I have thought that it was the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on the earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; from her perspective , Mack@@ ay said that the house@@ visit last week was clear that the &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I was clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am now pre@@ aching about it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was enig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s an un@@ decided between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police rub@@ bed into a crowd which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;

review by Yas@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; processing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
&quot; for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easy over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people can live longer after weight loss surgery longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a guide to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery using different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have been proven to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been conducted with people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which has been collected in a study since 2007 , and comparing two types of obesity surgery - mag@@ b@@ ypass and stomach tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who undergo surgery , decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the BM@@ I remained at those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those involved in a surgical procedure , at 36 % of the diabetes disease triggered the diabetes disease completely and 28 % partly . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar values over time . &quot;
&quot; Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is held at the best under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; according to the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflect on the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns in the BM@@ I ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that operation is leading to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was subjected to obes@@ e people suffering from obesity , about 29 percent less likely over 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , without increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient with his BM@@ I was between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait for long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not absorb all refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader called upon to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries would be admi@@ red in the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented George B@@ ush@@ s &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack from September 11 , and revealed that the violent reaction of the US was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my appl@@ ause in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know , his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lowed heavily alcoholic hand@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , reported poison control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming increasingly common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some of them do to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ ing with social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing oral water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be swal@@ lowed by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ked .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the University of Kansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not leave a si@@ gh whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after earthquake dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was brought into an emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold used in adults , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors supervised them overnight in a separate child hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by alcohol and had fallen to her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
&quot; in addition to alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of ham@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol contained a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ ylene alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher to po@@ ke their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher , as they put anti @-@ bacterial products around the ped@@ agog@@ ical room , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to ham@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and burned them out of her room .
&quot; the police were considered as &quot; &quot; par@@ ental &quot; , &quot; and instruc@@ ted discipl@@ ined measures to the school authority . &quot;

man after hum@@ id police chase hunt out of the C@@ anning River

&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in sei@@ zing and sum@@ p@@ ous water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to go back to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peac@@ ef@@ ield incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , they tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;

Peter Moody claims that Ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race sport
&quot; Peter Moody claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he zi@@ pped on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she was a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ fer@@ sample near Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had returned 18 months due to the es@@ pion@@ age allegations , and didn &apos;t want it to be seen as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have a long time to eat , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once again , &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go down , and I want my owners to think that I try to try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody had tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy his stable . &quot;
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will be asked if I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they believe that I am a che@@ er .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put on their n@@ oses because they are trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there is no need to make a difference . &quot;
should I bring this to the view that it is personal ?
&quot; the R@@ V@@ L has co@@ iled , and perhaps people who are responsible outside train@@ ers , is responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
I &apos;m bad for the industry ?
I &apos;m so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me sad .
I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ strations of the train@@ ers were built with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the late sc@@ rat@@ ching led to that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known by his preparation of the un@@ finished Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ acle , which was against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take the full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff was able to take care of mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it would have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot;

Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee judges the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ fight &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a very difficult note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land did not have &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew , and said that she was only concentrated on her &quot; &quot; contact &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers at his crew were confident , as it was worried that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring events when she spoke to us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and this has provided us the trend of the trend . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not getting used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s already funny how this time goes up again to this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divorce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so that they can play . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher score than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and no points are a cl@@ amping ? &quot;
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the game plans . &quot;
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , cars from the compact class are particularly important : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals dropped by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August to this segment . &quot;
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( audience days 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented in this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest pre@@ m@@ ations for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which is in the fall of the dealers . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; this means that the volume model also sells well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competitors VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen further diesel and gasoline engines offer 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel &apos;s Astra and Ford Focus gives the Opel Astra only a fifth belt . &quot;

&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce do not receive any services after the asylum application law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , there is no B@@ af@@ ö@@ g as it does not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ar persons . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must be closed , request Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; in the future , Islam will play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the State should succ@@ um@@ b the same rights as they have the same rights as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important to be the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the new ank@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , duties are also duties . &quot;
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam have to be clear contact to some and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas , and to allow certain control of control . &quot;
this also belongs to the willingness to spread against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the president of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to take such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot;
he suggested to translate the basic law on Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; this will also change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is urgent . &quot;
&quot; Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been a anti @-@ discrimination centre and a general gender equality law . &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NSU @-@ murder series showed that the police and authorities had systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what mig@@ ran@@ te organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been demanding for long and why international agreements , such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention , must become reality when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are supposed to use their possibilities - to benefit all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to supply the expected refugees medi@@ cally , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities are concerned , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , there must be additional money into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for all candidates at the registration of health cards . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , services could be reck@@ oned with the federal states . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , as many people are able to travel with limited power catalogue , which the asylum seek@@ ers act . &quot;
&quot; in other words , the doctors worry about the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical pra@@ ises would have to be taken over by interpre@@ ting costs . &quot;
&quot; for many refugees , many of the refugees have been helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; under refugee camps , there are much more uncomfortable disabilities , and the young people go to HIV @-@ education . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors from their education are clear , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite diarr@@ ho@@ ea or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even physicians . &quot;
&quot; in order to practice cultivation , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly turn out examinations again . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in particular , refugee children are vulnerable to refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study of the TU München published that every fifth Syrian refugee child was traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; anyone who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respiratory , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart disease and death . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms include sleep and concentration distur@@ ban@@ ces , strong sen@@ sibility and emotional de@@ bili@@ ty@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; however , psych@@ ic sick asylum seek@@ ers can provide a request for a psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , experts in the social offices often would not be trained in the social offices or doctors who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ understand@@ ings , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 up to 30,000 work@@ places within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ s and Chief Executive , who should guide the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent enterprise , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be concentrated on the provision of far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for companies . &quot; &quot;
it shares a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage one is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;

&quot; FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and , in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big shame in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to his old momentum during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his buttons , or with the injuries he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognised , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ amat@@ eurs in the last five playing times .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in injury rate during the last season is ongoing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from a violation , you have a time when you strengthen your body and gain martial force , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team . &quot;
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia what means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ reale and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to treat a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing places with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and continues to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al .

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open , now even more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ate among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ ho@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and there remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of finding the culture in question , to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study in more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressive symptoms revealed that if the suffering has a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery are double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends are the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media guided communication , with its emphasis on style , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to be strong , lively and successful , dou@@ bles , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by the domin@@ ating what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ inity values ; money , image , social status , all on cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality which is shining through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football look into cosy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of knowledge that men can relate to each case , even though they are often reluct@@ ant to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the telephone conversation it explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; my audi@@ ble roll for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ ordered , has really been shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old word &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status on the phone may also help people in moments of desper@@ ation , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you look at Starbucks someone alone , give him a smile and tell you Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Mal@@ m@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Mal@@ m@@ ö .
&quot; di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , and helps PS@@ G to pass on Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French Master on the way , but afterwards they took a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball@@ tor at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , because it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or exit in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things that we need to be perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it is not yet another or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on its own place against Bor@@ deaux in the first league , but he was exposed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing stor@@ mer was designated as the man who was taken to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he was in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense before he finished in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off in order to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field , and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead there were PS@@ G themselves sometimes on , with some mis@@ p@@ auses and bad distra@@ ctions , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic not least in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ start . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic to pass the Di Maria into a shooting , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole . &quot;
&quot; the second goal was finally shortly after the hours of the mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the former ay@@ er scored his sixth season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had found a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , was later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough .
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; brown re@@ acted , with ins@@ ane un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . &quot; okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the pro@@ du@@ ly group Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - who is always the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers over Minnesota Tw@@ ins

it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .

hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost updated the introduction and Bible texts .
&quot; at the beginning , the word was ? &quot;
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his personal interpretations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is not the same with &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to each subject , this can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; some three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles based on topics such as cross @-@ away , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or fa@@ ther@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has put on the basis of painting with the respective bi@@ bel@@ s . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible of Ot@@ mar Alt , and translated into current inter@@ relationships . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bi@@ bel@@ z@@ itat of Martin Luther , and each one of the artist who form@@ ulates his personal thought to the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden Let@@ tern .
&quot; so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order . &quot;
&quot; since the education has been done with the Rohr@@ stock , Ot@@ mar Alt is remembered . &quot;
I tried to be able to work in order to make me laugh again with the Lord &apos;s father .
&quot; his second concern was to help the art in a fast @-@ lived time again to be more important : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterised by rec@@ l@@ ame , and that &apos;s loud . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is pushed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wishes to let the viewer look into the images &quot; &quot; hin@@ der them , discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he is with his images . &quot;
&quot; old did not pay attention to capture the Bible , but also selected for him important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text is explained . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas wall paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .

&quot; for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure that the driver has no additional liability risks , the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework and where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany will be able to use internationally for example , that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h will be raised . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to use an amend@@ ment to the Vienna Convention , which has only seen the people as a driver . &quot;

&quot; the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and so that he put men into skirts . &quot;
I can &apos;t say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the Bürger@@ stei@@ g to the Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , which is seen from September 18th to the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a lucky fact that the fashion designer has changed its beginning to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he had been on the contrary , for : &quot; for me , an exhibition was a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come into the museum . &quot;
&quot; the impressive collection had already been made in Canada , Canada and Paris . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the scar@@ city of the man who has written fashion history , without ever having completed apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total art work , for which much effort is done : to make dolls , for example , a sty@@ list has been engaged for example . &quot;

jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Plau@@ ener tip as fashion niche

&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ ver@@ it@@ ze Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the initial times of the Plau@@ ener peak , fashion was a bigger role , then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : tip in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional tra@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which rests on past sticks , an increasing amount of order . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
our products reach customers on this way .
&quot; today in the Asian space , the mass production is much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , current to Russia and the US . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the ST@@ ICK@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used on the materials used . &quot;
&quot; diplom@@ a designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger exterior of the West@@ Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts , and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and tips . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a stress area between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly variable to keep a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ alizes the historic snow @-@ top tip .
&quot; at the same time , the machine is sti@@ cking at some places small kitchens . &quot;
&quot; the Plau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ed@@ master in Bi@@ anca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Krau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional plau@@ sible lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , they are awarded the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the subject of plau@@ sible lace - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plau@@ en and surroundings and would like to have a reminder of a reminder . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plau@@ ener peak . &quot;
