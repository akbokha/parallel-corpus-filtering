Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution will be discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for many years .
Washington critici@@ zes the continuing sett@@ ling of Israel and casts Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by Barack Obama &apos;s deal for the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two further deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as aff@@ ront of Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the immediate election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor conf@@ esses to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon lam@@ b told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officers found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note written on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who had been detained in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tk@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lam@@ b made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took the life when the police interven@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , the students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what lam@@ bs motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy with their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprised 17 members , and many students visited both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lam@@ b lob@@ ed , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lam@@ b previously asked the Delta State University to study for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for the Lam@@ b worked so hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic route to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt but , of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that the Lam@@ b cannot answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police finally found Lam@@ bs track when he came back in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house like a mile south of his parent &apos;s home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lam@@ b began his work at the University that has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y , he completed his doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when she met with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the flock of women . &quot;
&quot; all the girls were mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lam@@ b said &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , which borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lam@@ b hit Pre@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer @-@ fair market three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time , after Lam@@ b finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica aspi@@ ration . &quot;
there was no evidence that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lam@@ b made the call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lam@@ b referred to Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;

and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national poll@@ s showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at that time Rick Per@@ rine &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , of which no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but recei@@ v@@ ables such as J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump &apos;s stam@@ ina and start to run their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current estimates indicating that the estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :

&quot; in a survey by CNN / ORC last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would either be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate .

&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ ump &apos;s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bomb@@ astic and ins@@ ulting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week , the same number is considered in the first country state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively manage his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not fit into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters get acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they put their money back , republi@@ can voters appro@@ ve Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CNN / ORC from the last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July spent their money on J@@ eb Bush .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ ump &apos;s leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a poll of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have for@@ given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; however , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump called in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bomb@@ astic ex@@ clam@@ ation of Tr@@ ump &apos;s decisive Hez@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republican party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post poll of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; as long as immigration is left in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration about the government climb@@ s up to new heights .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son are now losing half of the support of Republican voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience . &quot;

a lucky hit by Thomas Müller p@@ aved the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ akos Pir@@ äus - then it ran .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze received a dream start in the &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; &quot; in the Wit@@ k@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of Train@@ ers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her appearance in the Champions League in the Champions League in the Greek record master Olympi@@ akos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starts in the series will be the first step towards finals on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ ote to Munich . &quot;
&quot; Müller won the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership at the Champions League for the Bavaria @-@ Tour of the Olympi@@ akos @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a commem@@ orative shot of the world champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , &quot; &quot; had promised Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm before the game in the Kar@@ aj@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich stopped word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without glit@@ tering .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the King class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 stum@@ bled here too Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ ups with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too monot@@ on@@ ous in their obvious efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by le@@ ft@@ wing on the left side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck of right than his flan@@ ks from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ so .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as Olympi@@ akos @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown suggested the Pole of Poland by the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct order , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked by the knee ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians were acc@@ ustom@@ ed to their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could bet on needle sti@@ ff@@ ness . &quot;

&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
the good news : in case of aband@@ on@@ ment the risk is reduced .

&quot; this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothetical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015 &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ der . &quot;
the scientists have observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; the main causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore back to frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ val infections in smokers . &quot;
it is not clear whether smoking may also increase the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who quit smoking may reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment is back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ ne@@ au Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , explained Master of study H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels , and also leads to good dental health up to high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure .

EU Commission proposes new judgment in dispute over TTIP
&quot; the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the resolution of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which is clearly more traditional in its functioning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström , the competent EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed the proposal as European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone of the world will be created with 800 million people . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ grant
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s profile has been eag@@ erly a@@ waited for his election since his election .
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will announce his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ grant and David Cameron &apos;s first time .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six issues shortly after noon , with his performance of the media probably and the Labour MPs from the vicinity . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commem@@ orative ceremony for the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several tracks stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful silence &quot; , &quot; and he accepted the &quot; &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a guide . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour &quot; , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limiting in profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are prefer@@ able to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30.000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will have both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ cken with ad@@ vers@@ aries and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of the economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the Lower House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question . &quot;
&quot; since it was broadcast on television first in 1990 , the question was viewed with the prime minister as the most important barometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ents , although critics argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a critic for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise as a critic for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; became ramp@@ ant through the in@@ famous dispute of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ f turned out a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ used by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am rather more mature is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi has been moved into the fight , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he really beha@@ ved very well in the US Open , even among the fairly provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he is working very hard , and he has never had a problem with other players , he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision of Kyr@@ gi@@ os not to take into account the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right to all but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; however , Hungary continued its hopes for a balanced action from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the emergency situation in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country was also planning to build a barb@@ ed wire fence along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed in the race , to create barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most incoming economies are seeking a better life and non @-@ war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ Meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us , who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convicted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency state , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters from associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 men trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are allowed to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia , after a draw wagon with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and expressed a crowd to press down there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .

&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit gap in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at a national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against her . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced that he is can@@ di@@ ted for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant in their election than those of the other candidates .

&quot; Clinton holds a great lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these origins have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has been whis@@ pered , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; but Clinton , however , has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead over this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters in the local elections say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;

perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons supporters in an open question are asked why they want the candidate is , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president will be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; to deal with problems and sel@@ ectivity , it is also quoted . &quot;
&quot; as the vice president thro@@ ws a potential for the president &apos;s office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;

&quot; five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elect@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in choosing the elections of their party .
&quot; we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best at hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions regarding Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and server during the term as Secretary of State , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions are not affected overall . &quot;

&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot;

five members of Brotherhood with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ st@@ ous ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , the murder charges against five people are submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed its transportation to hospital , which has contributed to his death , told the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target on a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to bring advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , uten@@ sils to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning in his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy , Den@@ g repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;

&quot; there is a rise in interest , and the house will be moved into vol@@ atility , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;

what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .

a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the US Central Bank stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal high places , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things a while vol@@ atile . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets can be seas@@ oned between 12 and 24 months after the first increase , which may be reflected in the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study to what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the under@@ growth cycle and the return of returns begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not have been before and which could speed up a recession . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rates since 1950 amounted to only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; interest rates in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question whether it is otherwise , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have prepared all the year on a net interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all under@@ mining cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and on @-@ rec@@ essions sh@@ aving very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months .

the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is carried out . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s strateg@@ ists believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer tie between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the earnings curve is flat , bor@@ rowing has expanded and the vol@@ atility has risen - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed shar@@ pens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and full , companies will benefit from the larger part of their business activities in the United States , of which interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will be worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Goldman Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ atility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot;

BBC @-@ General Director denied the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial rivals when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn more about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and making music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I really consider it important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controllers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports under fire , to step up the commercial rivals on the feet . &quot;

Saudi Arabia op@@ poses the collapse in part of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane collap@@ sed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane reached Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ eans .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession passed on the Holy See , where only days before a building crane came through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the beds . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 , who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Museum of Mek@@ ka , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to under@@ line . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents before the beginning of the annual meeting .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the add@@ res to Mec@@ ca , with thousands , who continue to go to the city will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group , said , would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad was prohibited abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man laugh@@ ed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ eans , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were in front of the ha@@ vo@@ c that took place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group has no statements about the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ad@@ ult@@ ed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka Gros@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .

the current process was adj@@ our@@ ned .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endant had cryst@@ alli@@ sed out in the preliminary investigation , that the def@@ endants were allowed to disp@@ ose of accounts from 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;

the sports workers are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; the defence of the non @-@ fi@@ del@@ ity , however , did not allow the association to be part of an asset at any time . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) had been invested in the sports club for which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club , &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ making profession of the financial officer . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have proposed money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said when he arrived . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of the financial success , the down@@ payment of insur@@ rec@@ tional damage has been retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one part of the insur@@ rection was only years later , namely the year 2003 , when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Pau@@ schal@@ - and not detail reviews appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the events . &quot;

this transfer has been form@@ ulated as &quot; claim repar@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; why damage compensation ? , judges and prosec@@ utors wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; on this point , the first def@@ endant ple@@ aded that he would not agree with this form@@ ulation , because the association has never created a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot;

&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; he could not make it , &quot; &quot; admitted authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lam@@ b , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he shot someone shot and someone killed . &quot;
&quot; according to the staff of the emergency center , Lam@@ b told the police officers to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but nobody will distur@@ b anyone , but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers according to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police seized the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt but , of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; killed on the ground . &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online at home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot;
&quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; I called Lam@@ b relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to jail . &quot;
&quot; when police handed him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lam@@ b drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , killing himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lam@@ b received a doctor@@ ate in the spring of 2015 , like his lifel@@ i@@ ke on the university &apos;s website . &quot;

&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this produced the left outer defending champion and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was burned in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .

he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .

&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;

&quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot;
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;

&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
&quot; unless , you are perhaps David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or message we have missed . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead added an abstra@@ ction of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &quot; &quot; she reads . &quot;
&quot; a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is admitted to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Camer@@ ons Elect@@ oral Office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there was no immediate immediate comment . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not shown on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali has developed as Spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , Adam Ly@@ th divor@@ ces from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their best sel@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ te , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully strikes further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot;
&quot; the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test schl@@ ager receives to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and reverse .
the only accus@@ ation that you can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - but this lost chance lies now in the past .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he has to get at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of letting Mo@@ een next to Cook , what an extra spin bow@@ ler can bring and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I did nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s throw from cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests first before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred of us immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he has very impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stats on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inn@@ akers who raise their hands and the train@@ ers decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart supplements for the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing rooms , even if the messages are in line with the previously announced . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ ectives te@@ amm@@ ates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
&quot; and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results . &quot;
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out of Britain from the EU ) could gain an allow@@ ance if the economy up to the year 2017 into a no@@ isy machine
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced re @-@ action strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C which viol@@ ated heavily on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ acy fre@@ und said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own debt , Britain itself created the agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contrac@@ tual changes that they usually do not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual general meeting that it would not be able to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say that they will gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it is for the exagger@@ ated long out@@ ings such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its release in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are going to take a leg to help the British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scottish leaving from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , perhaps some such ministers are even inten@@ tionally un@@ inten@@ tionally un@@ helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ trial was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the re@@ trial . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it did during the refer@@ end@@ ums of Tony Ben@@ n , which did not support our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak@@ ened to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ king , phone h@@ acking out@@ lands and the pseu@@ do non @-@ countries who have most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Tony Blair also thought about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better distributed ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ y@@ aner than Blair himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Blair had the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never left him .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time anymore for me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 years , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blue @-@ carbon trend and the wil@@ der Gef@@ il@@ der of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ and@@ â can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs in him did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provoc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without losing too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C said to his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , allowing him to give Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to exit - will foreign diplom@@ ats be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have no susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can all be meaning@@ less ?

Marktanalyse - Personal Accident and Health Insurance Claims and Exp@@ enses in Germany to 2018 : market Databook Timetric Ltd
&quot; asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health UK ( PH@@ E ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; Basic Code &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily w@@ indi@@ ge basis , &quot; based on PH@@ E its most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects the claim of PH@@ E that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to introduce their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not financing , which he should have received according to reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champions , some of which also indicate an industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .

&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that the allegations of BM@@ J were already re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smoking dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of E @-@ cigarettes are low compared to this , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what proof proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking is cost the National Health System of two billion euros a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear evidence of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcast fees should only be used to make the type of programs sent , which are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time window against the most popular shows of their rivals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the BBC Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio fee , what I don &apos;t think medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least give up its production at least on programs that others do not do or be commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ produced productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am acc@@ ustom@@ ed to seeing how this should be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows show that the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programmes should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they meet their tasks and they can argue if they have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broad@@ caster , Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , think all , think all that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be an example of the public @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and engage with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances in order to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes are changing the direction of the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction of the moment in which they have sound impul@@ ses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot;
impul@@ ses work by switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impul@@ ses to the brain of humans for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms are generally not responding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani showed that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves that penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves appear on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
&quot; sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when ultrasound is applied to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmit them into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch off neur@@ ons with impulse of light on and off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to a visual fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus is able to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic company advertisement , but &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ rint with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Amnesty International . &quot;
what we need now is a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally from our door@@ step .

&quot; eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have offen@@ ded - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;

this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship going on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;

would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would move into the same student residence ?

&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums does not have a sustainability .
for the people remain in a big part here .
&quot; in view of the flood of refugees , we also need sufficient housing for the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;
heroes of the Storm ( Hot@@ S ) - S@@ GT . hammer
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different when you put people in housing blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , there is peace again , I go back . &quot;
the house is heated by electricity . 1 bathroom with shower . 1 toilet . at least one bathroom with heated floor . freezer . microwave oven . dish washer . wood@@ burning stove . stereo set . CD . digital satellite dish . DVD . high chair . washing machine
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is about 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; for six months , the construction took place . &quot;
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?

&quot; in particular , it is always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ ul Special Construction and the Sub@@ ordin@@ ate Ord@@ in@@ ance . &quot;
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house needs at least three plots . &quot;
&quot; only in the cities , the square is lacking . &quot;
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .

&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were , those who have accused me of creating luxury constructions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but do not ti@@ ghten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ bert : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford to be able to afford . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space . &quot;

&quot; some are encountered after installation , because they receive an error message that tells you that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to be continued , because the phone may switch on half way and this could lead to a shut@@ down of the updates . &quot;

&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade denied it , however , that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the early morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day other buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;

&quot; on its most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen spending two days a week round a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ og@@ any table to decide whether it is time to lift the Leit@@ z@@ ins for the first time . &quot;
&quot; im@@ pending over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story seat sa@@ ver is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold commission from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ ri@@ ghtful third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be spo@@ iled by the unprecedented incentives by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data in the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives fear@@ ful to rein@@ force this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter of percentage point . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to do not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what is causing itself to the financial market itself .
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists interviewed recently by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted an increase in interest rates this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average Revenue rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would calm the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be required , an increase in the pro@@ position . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constant under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but financial markets all over the world sent together in the end of the month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial Average Revenue fell by more than 16 % as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would reduce global growth . &quot;

&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy were not occ@@ ured in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liners , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liners . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world &apos;s currency . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; in 2013 , the mere suggestion of the former Lei@@ ters Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; close &quot; its monetary expansion , resolved confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ connected , F@@ ed representatives can be expected that they will not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that are not linked to the economic foundation dates . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , intended to raise interest rates , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its leading z@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions despite limited identi@@ fiable effects on growth in the United States , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market break in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of an increase in interest because markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be ahead of time . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during bre@@ ast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are painted on breasts , painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours . &quot;

mayor rode &quot; edge &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge fest last Sunday , when there were suddenly ten people standing on the tent at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au by train . &quot;
&quot; because Germany was surprisingly dis@@ continued on Sunday because of the refugee flow , the railway traffic with Austria was surprisingly dis@@ appo@@ inting for them , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and the designers along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we opened the un@@ hoped guests once again , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N chat . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man was not allowed to commit a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels , the str@@ anded train passengers went to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening in order to make it to Germany after the short notice that the railway traffic was shut down to Germany , but still to try the border . &quot;
but the regional train was put off at the Inn at W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge firmly linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , Sunday preceding a brid@@ ging race - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends another Z@@ ig@@ h to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to help establish structures that ensure human@@ eness , our Federal Chancellor has officially opened up the position of the Hungarian government in the dun@@ geons of National Socialism . &quot;
this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee flow and the approaching winter , to make decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening was answered with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make nine confident that Hot @-@ Seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 p.m .

&quot; the woman , who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we started with Sarah Mack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before starting three two , you might acci@@ dentally be given a hint of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game destroyed , who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ s called both fast - except himself - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house , and ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt that they were fairly compatible , and I have thought it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is on the ground with both feet on the ground , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood was &quot; &quot; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now pres@@ um@@ ably adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose if not she , she was mysterious . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a tie between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests for their impressive open work@@ day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some train@@ ers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a triangle , as it did the Aus@@ sie rug@@ by League conversion at his first pun@@ t @-@ return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was re@@ produced in the first quarter of Minnesota Vi@@ kings &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian favour for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start to his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that is now common , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; free voters are demanding the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of the collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Sunday fra@@ ction of the Free voters was postpon@@ ed until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in fact , all other main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by free voters .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the cl@@ ut@@ ches , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we need to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
&quot; for asylum seek@@ ers , the free voters want to push the free voters as fast as possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ chief critici@@ zed that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen wearing rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police were shot into a crowd , demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , leading district officials said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , and some of you threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before res@@ orting to rubber bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ bs , of which it is known that they can kill , but they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently a so high death rate produced . &quot;
&quot; the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ acc@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
&quot; there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to own a state . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who don &apos;t get surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that wrote a guide to the new study in J@@ AMA surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity interventions have been proven effective for treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in regards to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data collected in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was among those who did not have surgical diabetes treatments equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us disease was completely free and at 28 % partly . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood glucose levels that reflect the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level dropped by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher levels in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and saw a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ gone an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think that we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama , adding that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader encouraged the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech during the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how killing is less@@ ened in their countries . &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the issue of violence and also commented George B@@ ush@@ s &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 , saying that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four times increase of inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low strong alcoholic dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants reported in children under 12 years to report the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children deliberately drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ ing with the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how youth dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing especially in small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Kansas State University Hospital , the broad@@ caster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of small hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah taught her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had stum@@ bled across the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; it was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; in addition to alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students planned to poison the fourth class in New York State , to poison her &quot; painted &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; said a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and burned it out of her room .
&quot; the police regarded the dist@@ orted plan as &quot; &quot; squ@@ ir@@ rel &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show cli@@ ma@@ xes of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here not only talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
you are talking about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will twist the things , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chief sw@@ am to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Mal@@ m@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 men from Aber@@ deen , who now stand clearly at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before , and we will come back again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .

&quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said , &quot; January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; players who come in the summer have this high season time to integrate , what you have seen with our own group in this season . &quot;
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation came first for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be selected will be able to observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with tel@@ eph@@ ones and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you get access . &quot;
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; they said that &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulated , &quot; but still thinks that it is false what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the fact .
but I believe that a strong likelihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think its execution is incorrect .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can turn to .
&quot; what you will get from me is what it means , to see a man dying to die . &quot;
man after hum@@ id police chase persu@@ aded to get out of the p@@ anning river
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in sei@@ s@@ mic and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a c@@ ensu@@ s incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ez was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned out a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master &apos;s football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the tren@@ ches to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River . &quot;
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot;
Peter Moody claimed that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to finish racing .
Peter Moody claimed that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he entered the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that she had conducted a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had taken back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age allegations , and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have enjoyed a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; Moody said . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go around the main street , and I want my owners to think that I try to try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody held the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months I saw Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; Moody writes on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put on their n@@ oses because they have failed to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is important to note that there is still a lot of interest in the online gaming industry . &quot;
should I bring this to the view that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L act as co@@ war@@ dly and makes people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
is I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I &apos;m .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say that they are thinking about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation near Li@@ dar@@ i , and the late sc@@ rat@@ ching led to the fact that he could throw his license through the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known by his preparation for the un@@ proposed Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horses debate , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against rivals due to claims on ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has been critic@@ ised by the Tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
&quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer , Tr@@ ent Robinson , said that the arbit@@ rator made the Storm tournament &quot; &quot; ring fights &quot; &quot; with his team during the high storm champion in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot;
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Train@@ ee Wayne Benn@@ ett made a barely covered mark to the Storm Team , after his team achieved Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she was only concent@@ rating on her &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at the Tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team is confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; this appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about the combined events when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and this has resulted in the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this time this season is coming up again .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons , the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he would take care of a divorce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play how they can play . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and no points anything exciting ? &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the game plans . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm Team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin starting next morning . &quot;

&quot; a man who could possibly end@@ ure a lifetime sentence because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ caine , smug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the dro@@ ge on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ accused in the marina during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ long punishment for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ caine , the lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café had been a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;

&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when he was asleep , entered into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children , sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping chicken .
&quot; she saw it through , found the bew@@ il@@ dered messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother immediately . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he had done it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten p@@ est . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
&quot; she also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone , and confronted the def@@ endants with it . &quot;
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation took advantage of speaking with girls , who saw much younger than he was . &quot;

the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
&quot; in 2015 , the compact cars are mainly moving to the compact cars , which are currently being sold very well . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of the new appro@@ vals fell to this segment alone in August . &quot;
this is reflected on the IAA ( public days 17th to 27th of September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest pre@@ m@@ ations for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available in autumn at the dealers . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra does not have to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents a step @-@ by @-@ step below the biggest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen will offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which will also be seen at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot;
and what will be up next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?

the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; however , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer data , the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) . &quot;

&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;

&quot; it is important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare union , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers , is also important . &quot;

&quot; FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates have to stand before the match against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and provided rehabilitation according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ ist scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in combination with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there are the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different po@@ inters from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league matches in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from a breach , you have a prone period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns to a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to get a little break @-@ off , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourite is to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale of 3.2 . &quot;
&quot; this year , it was the 10th in Zagreb . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains of the distant hope of bringing the club to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al .

&quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about men friend@@ ships &quot;
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more dou@@ b@@ ted than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 in Great Britain , and three times more often in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of putting the culture into question that hin@@ ders men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , alive and successful , even if in reality isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently , money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , shining through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the soccer game in cozy chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case , even if they are often reluct@@ ant to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a member of the telephone pastoral care it explained to me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ confident , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of men friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone may help people in moments of desper@@ ation also may help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the re@@ designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting in Starbucks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .

&quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria arrives at Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game review and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main played its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ on in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ stream in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t even have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided at its own place against Bor@@ deaux during the First League , but he was pushed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was designated as the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense before he finished in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , who suggested the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this stage , entered the field with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes admitted , with some mis@@ car@@ riages and bad agreements , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who did not have less than five attempts only in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ launch . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who turned the Di Maria into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth win after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended up all the thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which didn &apos;t have the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hats off from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago in front of the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for the FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion league champion , two times European champion , twice champion , a time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi is now pointing out that he was ahead of Barcelona before the European champ@@ ionships in 2008 . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; at that time Madrid won everything , we didn &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;

and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change the team without being able to imagine the team without me .
&quot; so he made me get me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Lad@@ y@@ boy@@ Alexandra is on @-@ line . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film@@ making
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; he was shocked , with ins@@ ane un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . &quot; okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian felt . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , which is beaten by her white plu@@ mage . &quot;
the producer of Dear White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the direction rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media exploded in front of the dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 views since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Matter movement achieved a nationwide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against fer@@ vor . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince gave an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album quiet matter , &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , the Black Li@@ ves Matter movement has published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elizabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who were invited to visit the Pope , to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; if he accepted the invitation or met the Pope , it is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; Crow@@ ns First Champion
&quot; professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first Ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prize of $ 1 Million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who could shut down all levels of its obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time that he was the first Ath@@ lete who completed the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior , but Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock over the winning of the Grand Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had a life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will be the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , it receives the great gra@@ tification . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gro@@ ll over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I am glad that Isaac is . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers past Minnesota Tw@@ ins past
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
IPTC : caption Parkway Drive live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken ( Switzerland ) on June 13th 2009 . IPTC : Copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic .
Tw@@ ins spent a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Qu@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit had scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) sm@@ ote 6 times on 1 / 3 inside and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has w@@ ro@@ ught the pl@@ ywood , &quot; &quot; said Bal@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( strokes training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh season , Tw@@ ins had their best chance to get back to the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon released his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ schl@@ ager Miguel S@@ ano , who shot a two @-@ run the right @-@ hand Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run , Ver@@ hagen presented the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was that in the Major League for 27 times in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings added a Insurance Run , the wall secured a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed bass , however , set S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game by an even non @-@ mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ ans , who had been cancelled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having lost more than one month due to a back@@ lash . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted to do , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt better than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in Third In@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runner in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers set up in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t hit particularly well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the re@@ lics of the right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .

&quot; he is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 . &quot;

here is the rain that lasts until Thursday night .
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be expected to be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after the last few days have already fallen large . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the f@@ öh@@ n goes out , as a result is a cold front with strong , partially we@@ ather@@ ed rain from West to East via Switzerland . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin Luther square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , the name of the German Re@@ former was ch@@ ri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome , next to the Kol@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot;
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Chur@@ ches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the city of the pop@@ es over centuries could only live in secret their faith . &quot;
the place will become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) beha@@ ved as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; he received the city at that time , as a ver@@ itable scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; his negative impressions , however , should be encouraged by historians in his later struggle against Rome . &quot;
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ ur .
hammer artist invested three years into personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his personal interpretations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this may seem quite dark . &quot;
&quot; some three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has taken a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are Cy@@ cles which dedic@@ ate themselves to themes such as cross @-@ way , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or fa@@ ther@@ ours . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hogan Lov@@ ells
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has placed himself on the basis of painting with the respective bi@@ blical places . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quot@@ ation by Martin Luther , and each one of the artist who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ ost Order . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing has happened with the pi@@ stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to get up this , in order to bring me back with the Lord Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern was to help Art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of worlds is characterised by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wishes to let the viewer go into the pictures &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures , &quot; &quot; discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I am not sure where you &apos;re getting your info , but great topic . I will certainly be back . &#124; &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which opens on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequ@@ in that will look amazing thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became the big star of the fashion scene , among other things , with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I cannot say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was easy , in the meantime it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he had been on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one comes into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving work of the man , who wrote fashion story without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total art work , for which a lot of effort was carried out : for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated for example . &quot;
14 tons of material have car@@ ed the makers according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
&quot; shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , there was still a special delic@@ acy : a le@@ der@@ hosen outfit with cor@@ set . &quot;
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot;
also G@@ aul@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , grac@@ eful fashion attempt of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and badly in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy BH@@ s and clothes , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he then taught the dra@@ ining of fashion at the same time .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
&quot; but later , I bought it naturally . &quot;
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he didn &apos;t have to pay the models . &quot;

jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Plau@@ ener Spitze as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Plau@@ en &apos;s about making meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example , for blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; today , this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ ver@@ it@@ ze Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of Plau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major part , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewellery , accessories such as bags and for regional trades . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past stem po@@ stures , is an increasing job potential . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
&quot; today in the Asian region , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold over chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports to Russia and the USA are also weak@@ ening . &quot;
there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to focus on environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the ST@@ ICK@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; diplom@@ a designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the &quot; &quot; Schne@@ eber@@ ger &quot; &quot; of the West Saxony University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the machine is sti@@ cking small kitchens at some places . &quot;

&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plau@@ en and surroundings and would like to be a reminder . &quot;

XI urges the economy to open wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned by the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote innovation and promote reforms , new momentum and vitality will bring about new opportunities for economic growth , Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , funding of the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not in question for investment . &quot;
the system will be tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ sures the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legally binding business environment and designed the market more open , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen checks on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure businesses decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China &apos;s border areas will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of a bid to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments , and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and bring better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by making the requirements optimized and the application process is facilit@@ ated . &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury level in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the marginal values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to increase the consumption of a significantly higher dose of nerve fibres .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force in pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sh@@ midt , the marginal values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily loaded with mer@@ cury that may not be sold on the basis of the current limit values about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches . &quot;

&quot; according to Food@@ watch , the EU according to Food@@ watch aims to ti@@ ghten the marginal values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; however , food@@ watch described this as a &quot; plo@@ y &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low that they already hold the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly poison@@ ous for humans .
&quot; in this way , the Federal Government warns against &quot; already small amounts of especially in un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declar@@ es on its homepage with regard to the current limits , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury enters the environment primarily through coal combustion .

&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish about in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and sur@@ passed over , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been quoted from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish already counted among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RAS@@ FF . &quot;
