Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just a friendly one .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution is to go . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by Barack Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two . &quot;
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu , at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , had held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , professor tries to have his girlfriend shot dead . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he shot his girlfriend , and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officers found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cut down on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , has already travelled 300 miles to the school site , where he was killed and killed by police according to the police . &quot;
Delta State University Political Advisor Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lam@@ b had made the fatal emergency call some@@ time later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ b took the life when the police bo@@ arded him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , the students and lect@@ urers needed to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details provided by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to their teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lam@@ b praised , said , he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lam@@ b had asked Delta State University for reasons for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion , for which Lam@@ b had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic route to an employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that can &apos;t answer the Lam@@ b anymore .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs trail when he entered the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his par@@ ental home near Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lam@@ b started his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he received a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the flock of women . &quot;
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lam@@ b said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no document from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; after three years , Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail arrived at a summer fair three years ago . &quot;
later they played one or another gig together .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;

&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September last time after Lam@@ b finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica aspi@@ ration . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of joke . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and speci@@ alis@@ es in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening , around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;

&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lam@@ b had the emergency call after he had shot , and that Lam@@ b called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever got married . &quot;
toys R Us plans to hire less workers for Christmas time
&quot; toys R Us say that there are not so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealers say that he will give a chance to work for more hours with him and seasonal workers . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; the company said it will start with job interviews this month , and the number of employees from October to December is rising . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business comes closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to supply stores with employees who sell , send and distribute products . &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ tt@@ ed that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable .

some have tried to brand him as flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in poll@@ s down@@ wards , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate market . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republican nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain where none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps &apos;s stam@@ ina and start to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate che@@ que is not just a temporary phase :

&quot; in a survey of CNN / ORC last week 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is only 21 per cent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bomb@@ astic and ins@@ ulting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters think that the real estate market Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament to a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament is not pas@@ se in the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their rifle hats , republi@@ can voters tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say a poll of CNN / ORC previous week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten ended their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everybody . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University early September shows that in a hypothetical header @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .

a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have fixed their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot of things can happen to change this , and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; however , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competitor in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago , immig@@ rant from Mexico &quot; R@@ ape , &quot; was the immigration boom and fishing point in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bomb@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration is left in the ra@@ mp , Donald Tr@@ ump will appear to do well . &quot;

double Tor@@ ch in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
&quot; a lucky hit by Thomas Müller , the FC Bayern decided to make the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ akos Pir@@ äus - then it ran . &quot;
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have described the FC Bayern as a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of Train@@ P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ up in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ akos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9. ) earned 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth star &apos;s success in the series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 , where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; Müller received his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of gü@@ st Mi@@ xing of Olympi@@ akos @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the world champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm had promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept words . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shine .
&quot; Pir@@ äus had won his youngest six home games in the King class , among them against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously ran , but often too imagin@@ ative to work in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks have often been initiated by game transfer to the left @-@ side Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; on the right , Müller had more luck than his flan@@ ks from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ akos @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Poland &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct acceptance , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with his knee @-@ par@@ ted ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians played their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set the needle . &quot;
at Tor@@ hil@@ ter Manuel Neuer was leaving .
&quot; for example , when he had a shot of ide@@ ye on the l@@ aces ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; before new , Guardi@@ ola decided to defend a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the ca@@ vern , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given green light after the final training , said C@@ FO Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something else out of it is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said the Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström in the presentation . &quot;
the Swe@@ de presented the proposal as a European negotiating position in the US free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world will be created with 800 million people . &quot;

&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tribun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel justice to force the company to face damages in tax@@ pay@@ ers , stock@@ pil@@ ing national laws or en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ us@@ o presented the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it has not been critic@@ ised for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;

Irish Folk by Su@@ fj@@ an Stev@@ ens in Hamburg

&quot; in addition to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the inti@@ mid@@ ating folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places he always recorded on the map , describing his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arrangements . &quot;
&quot; where they were born and how it looks like , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , Stev@@ ens proves to be wonderfully creative ir@@ ony . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ g of the Prime Minister is expected to be eag@@ erly a@@ waited &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question , and set up for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up to put the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision , on Tuesday during the s@@ ine of the national an@@ them , prov@@ oked a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several Tit@@ anic stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ bo@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and it is called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliam@@ ent@@ arian party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within the Labour &quot; , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has proposed to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith said , the shadow working and pensions minister , that the party &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; is that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the fra@@ g of the prime minister is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he has both &quot; &quot; pun@@ ish@@ ness &quot; &quot; and that he has made a focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the House of Commons , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was first broadcast in 1990 on television , the question was considered as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

&quot; while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; gr@@ ated by the in@@ famous dispute of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters into the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rators . Har@@ rison said , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f war@@ med a potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I &apos;m quite a ri@@ cher is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little bit into the conflict , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost a sei@@ z@@ ure in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he did very well in the US Open , even among the fairly provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision of not to take into account Kyr@@ gi@@ os during the important preliminary decision taken on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight where he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;

Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and ri@@ ded the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and stopped all those trying to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the limit when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Ser@@ b officials with ou@@ trage .
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose up .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; op@@ enings &quot; op@@ ted the border ! &quot; and sm@@ ashed ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some referred to protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc in a disputed meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed . &quot;
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crow@@ ned Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged on Tuesday a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; but Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a bal@@ lot campaign of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stand in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum proceedings . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a thorn @-@ dra@@ h@@ tz@@ a@@ uns along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison cells were used in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck in the Middle East for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the incoming business refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government left along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es state emergency , &quot; said spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected to be expected next week , but journalists from Associated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on tag@@ el@@ ang on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by damage the fence , they are now in police custody , and are accused of being accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials opened two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders was arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd to push there . &quot;
&quot; approximately 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
elections in Israel : Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s victory over the Labor Party coalition

&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he has can@@ di@@ fied for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .

&quot; Clinton holds a great advantage in women and women , but these origins have reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support in men has sunk significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and it and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; for example , half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ election would say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party . &quot;

&quot; since the vice @-@ president thro@@ ws up a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ mire , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the pre @-@ election are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
Clin@@ tons followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ di@@ ate for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , points out of 20 points with Bi@@ den in race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second part of this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the choice . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elect@@ orate is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics to voters in the elections of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den regard the majority as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds are best suited to the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in general , democratic voters of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elect@@ ors have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as a foreign minister , most Democratic voters of the pre @-@ election are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .

&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinions were still worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of ten who say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a sham@@ eful ritual as a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people were filed . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ schaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which resulted in his death , the police informed . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 @-@ pound pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches and then he fell un@@ conscious .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ ing and waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members to hide uten@@ sils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tik@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a car screening , Den@@ g was added repeatedly with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the fri@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen every year , &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family since 1970 . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a charge for murder of the third count for the first five members .
&quot; thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of lethal attacks and formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also go to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed raises interest
&quot; a zinc increase comes , and the house will be moved into fu@@ elling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long that will last and how long it will be stopped .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the economy . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a view based on historical trends that could react to some areas of the economy :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , interest increases can make things more vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency for net assets to be de@@ ferred from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happened to the F@@ ed interest rates . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ den@@ ced later in the er@@ ection cycle , and returns the return to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and could speed up a recession . &quot;
&quot; it is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point , at a interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants rose to a interest rate of the F@@ ed year , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ended on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade gives only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all er@@ ection cycles of 1950 to present in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights were very fast after the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months so far .
&quot; the firm income was vol@@ atile , as the market takes a interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is done .
&quot; at the end of the cycle cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s strateg@@ ists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit cl@@ amping has increased , and the vol@@ atility has risen - all features of the market if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies will benefit from the major part of their business activity in the US , benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts become worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .

&quot; the BBC Music Awards , starting last year , seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously called examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC general director rejected allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rivals when it comes to public music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I really consider important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British did not know less about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport to kick off the commercial rivals . &quot;

Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that , in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered more than 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones killed when a crane crashed into Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the mour@@ ning proc@@ ession went over to the Holy Place , where only days had a crane building through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released to the funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company of bin Laden family because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 victims , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 bet@@ ters who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to bury the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ les will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to go to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the bin Laden group would not be able to steal the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree has been published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was banned abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was obliged to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month , gathered together . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group has no statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also took the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project conducted by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an ab@@ omin@@ able son who was kidn@@ apped by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are paid to the members of the Get@@ ou@@ tes , and the same amount of permanent injured . &quot;

&quot; according to the Attorney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the preliminary investigation that the accused were able to disp@@ oni@@ ze money from association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes . &quot;

&quot; the sports facilities had only paid expenses and the sports club , which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , led out of debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va continued around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue to continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the accused , in the bread@@ making of the profession of large @-@ firm account@@ ants of the financial system . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have proposed money to put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debt . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the down@@ payment of the expenses of expenses declined in 1991 to 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the deduc@@ tions was only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Pau@@ schal@@ - and not detailed illustrations appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ par@@ tures administ@@ ered the two def@@ endants together , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; why cash payments were not disclosed in detail in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in detail for financial support , but it was important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;

&quot; the def@@ endants were denied , and the def@@ endants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant , and was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; then he finally meant , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything about that money , the prosec@@ utor turned into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary was right . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; &quot; compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this form@@ ulation because the association never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; With whom are you all of the tailor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never paid a cent salary , he paid only o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; on di@@ ets he charged 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the accused were not able to demonstrate accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; according to an operating audi@@ ting , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
the second def@@ endant was also referred to as o@@ dom@@ eter money .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
&quot; the world is observed when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest was raised or not . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed Interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , secretary of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to set up an increase , but the indications suggest that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday

&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague and killed his colleagues , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it unbe@@ ar@@ able , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lam@@ b , lect@@ urer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he had shot on someone and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; according to the staff of the emergency centre , Lam@@ b told the police polic@@ emen to send police to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shocked my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but nobody will bother &quot; nobody , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 , who said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing him before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when the polic@@ emen were killed . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; Drei@@ eck@@ ties affair . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss processed online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , has been with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said Lam@@ b had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; as police officers took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lam@@ b drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lam@@ b received a doctoral degree from Delta State University , as his life lau on the university &apos;s website . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United cannot play for months because of double fra@@ ctions
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this brought the left outer def@@ ender to we@@ ep and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was hospit@@ alized .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later , and then be operated in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;

&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;

Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot;
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked out as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry .

certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax knows better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it almost . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to use Dr. Se@@ uss &apos;s environmental label in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a news on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead of giving an abstra@@ ction of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ un @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , is hoping to gain a real tree . &quot;
&quot; a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though he agrees to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is a little familiar with the act of the book . here an un@@ named boy sounds like the local environment by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , Th@@ ought stri@@ cken Once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , sn@@ ur@@ ry creature , &quot; which is called in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron &apos;s constitu@@ ency office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but gave no further comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly under threat from the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der , England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward win .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry a sc@@ ar of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this - players are their own best choices . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully beat further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his post@@ ure , even though he did not deliver such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is mainly a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test hammer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean , but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot;
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which was very successful . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those in front of him , but this depends on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s head of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een has perhaps not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has managed three hundred R@@ us immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may possibly see their stats - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who rise up their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor to the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all circumstances and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket Challenge , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the dressing cabin , even if the messages are consistent with the previously ch@@ ased . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used by the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players don &apos;t determine the schedule . &quot;
&quot; and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results . &quot;
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ going Britain from the EU ) could win on Zul@@ auf when the economy was hit by 2017 in a loud no@@ isy
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced re@@ mix strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who was strongly dis@@ appo@@ inting for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplomat friend told me that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of own guilt , Britain itself created an agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they usually don &apos;t want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection . &quot;
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie @-@ agenda too .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants a great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials in some capit@@ als have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened at the exagger@@ ated long exp@@ end@@ ents such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a burning force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left wing . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are going to rip a leg to help the Sel@@ fie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scottish exit from the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately do not inten@@ tionally not provide helpful comments , completely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 in order to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a &quot; &quot; P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain did not win anything from the new trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost , and which EU scep@@ tics the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they cannot remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists , who have made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight Ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 @-@ years . &quot;
&quot; with all of his in@@ genu@@ ity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Med@@ ley was part of the tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone hack@@ ers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners , most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair thought similar about her , but determined that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you have better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he resi@@ sted Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Blair had rejected the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back@@ door to him . &quot;

&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 years , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I am very friendly - in the development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ arb@@ ase tendency and the wil@@ ds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism may well say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs in him did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provoc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , even what J@@ C told his fellow comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties on their exam day on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - messages discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and in front of all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe , which allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin become political capital - they have also susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?

&quot; according to a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking , from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) decided to critic@@ ise the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily strong foundation , &quot; based on PH@@ E its most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champions , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;

&quot; he said , &quot; E cigarettes are substantially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion € a year . &quot;
&quot; the clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows in their rivals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to contact the BBC for six years in Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee during his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to hold the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t consider medi@@ um@@ - or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not make or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to this . &quot;
I have to see how this public television should be public .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , conducted by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ cence was due to the ambition of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 , but they carry out their tasks , and they can argue when they &apos;re going to vote on their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion pounds of radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ scen@@ ities programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broadcast charge Johnson said the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think we all think that you get a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should take an example of the public @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television can be shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes will change direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems which can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes alter the direction of the moment in which they have high frequencies for human hearing , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impul@@ ses work by switching on mot@@ ion@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves . &quot;
read more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that det@@ ects electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread ul@@ c@@ ers usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves appear on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ on@@ enk@@ ins , and in the membran@@ es of some of the worms . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these I@@ onic channels and activ@@ ates the cells they are associated with , such as a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ones are TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ onic channels . &quot;
&quot; when ultrasound is applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmit to the worms where they turn on the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be revealed in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass tissue un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly adv@@ anta@@ geous housing can be created : he builds in a project ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a big part here .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need enough living space for the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ raced house needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
&quot; this is different , if you teach people in blocks of blocks . &quot;
&quot; each of the six houses built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters per house amounts to EUR 184 000 , without grounds . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; for six months , the construction took place . &quot;
that is appropriate .
do the building rules complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : building legally , I have gone through my project correctly . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still under@@ going , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; only in the cities , the place is missing . &quot;
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ raced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a boom in Germany over the last five years , but built in luxury apartments that hardly can afford to afford . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the ger@@ mans . &quot;
I will show you how to build a good and well @-@ built environment today .
that &apos;s why it goes .

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , tap on &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , since they receive an error message that tells the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more prob@@ able by adding the updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete apps , and then rein@@ stall it once the process is finished . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is close to a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to be continued , as the telephone may be switched on half way and could lead to a down@@ turn of the updates . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex earnings mixed , financial prospects reduced for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its profit view over a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and € 10@@ ,90 in the financial year , ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the company said it is still expected that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid earnings , considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday @-@ employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to employ 90@@ .000 to 95@@ .000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which asked twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research analysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority ship@@ ments , which resulted in sales in its unit express ship@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in the last quarter , sales of ground transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for bigger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was falling due to higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;

&quot; on their most expected conference in the years , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ agon@@ i table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story seating sa@@ ver , there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ even third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X Factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ to @-@ zero interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets might be anxious to rein@@ force this vol@@ atility by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and whether it is just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is in@@ sured by itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently interviewed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a interest increase this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets are expected to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate , unless the strateg@@ ists will alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow , as they promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintained the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; she must go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm down the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would be the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the pro@@ position . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world reached the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial Average estimated more than 16 % below its highest level , as investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would reduce global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , and the Dow falls by almost 10 % below the court of May . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would pull the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
&quot; now he says ahead , that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will affect the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
&quot; in recent years , the influence of the Central Bank was enormous . &quot;

&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , right @-@ right member of the Federal Open Market Committee , decided to raise interest rates , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its guidelines by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis as early as 2008 , &quot; &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a interest increase because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should rush ahead . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition during bre@@ ast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet is actually affecting women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;

&quot; in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; by doing so , we get a wonderful large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; in turn led to the roof of the roof , which is intended for energy reasons - different than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was necessary because the building plan was not permitted in terms of the roof to the roof , whereby the Bern@@ ri@@ eder Municipal Council was rather restri@@ ctive on liber@@ alisation orders . &quot;

&quot; this policy is not only the Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now in the border areas . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to find out that the &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ cket Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening came with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and beat The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood , finally landed in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up , whether she is the one who has received the last rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah Mack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you might have acci@@ dentally given a hint of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood holds his lips until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have settled in ly@@ rical ways , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; their answers to the game are to be destroyed , who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ o called both quick - except himself - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house , I noticed that they were quite compatible and I thought it was quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet on the ground , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ o added . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously was not just a game - I &apos;m now pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ous to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;

&quot; the 49@@ ers sports reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specification teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his lost f@@ ang and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota Vi@@ kings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian favour for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;

&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd of people protest@@ ing against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening at Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , District official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , while some of you threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police have used tear gas , and then poured into the air before putting back on rubber boots . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rub@@ bers used , which are known to kill them , which are traditionally used as less lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ achi@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would decrease their political influence . &quot;
&quot; there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to own one &apos;s own state . &quot;
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal that has been centrally ruled out for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those that receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out by people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data used in a study have been used in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ it @-@ pass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ bs - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained in those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes @-@ disease dissolved completely and partially at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the conduc@@ tive researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger returns in BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs. 2.1 % ) and rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people suffering from obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have combined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; Europe could not take all of the refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; despite the Dal@@ ai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a real peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the issue of violence and also commenting on George B@@ ush@@ s &apos;s actions following the terrorist attack on September 11 , and revealed that the violent response of the US with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;

&quot; poison control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants reported in children under 12 years , reported tox@@ in control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them walk in the emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink due to a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very attractive to children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sy@@ ring@@ es from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to an emergency . &quot;
&quot; their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold required by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah heard her words and was not able to go when she arrived at the emergency .

it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ins and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; staff of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students planned to poison the fourth class in the state of New York to poison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom increases . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May until July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased to € 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the corn@@ erst@@ one for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; some later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death Chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison gas . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January through his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the U.S. , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen will see it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m going to sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you get access . &quot;
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulating &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I think there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters who can turn to this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police persecution persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt of a man from Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a house peaceful incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when she discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ have@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the tren@@ ches to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River . &quot;
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot;
Peter Moody &apos;s claim that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing .
&quot; Peter Moody is claiming that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing , and he even found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he could not explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held himself 18 months for es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I spent a long time on it , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go up with the head , and I want my owners to think that I try to do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; prior to that , Moody introduced the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out its stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to grasp . &quot;
&quot; Robert Beck@@ ham , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ s , Chairman of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I bring it to the opinion that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in co@@ war@@ dly and makes people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
are I bad for the industry ?
are I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ strations of the train@@ ers have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the late sc@@ rat@@ ching led to that he said he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which was viol@@ ated against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it would have been the whole day yesterday , what was so . &quot;
but it had also been on the race day too .
Moody could face a triple @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; &quot; Moody said . &quot;

Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the judges have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm winning in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Coach Wayne Benn@@ ett made a barely covered note to the Storm team after his team had scored the Final win against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample sample &quot; &quot; of rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ad of his team and said they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; in the tac@@ kling .
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading train@@ ers on his team is confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this happens repeatedly - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when she had beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real point of focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team . he is probably not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;

&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit concerned to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game storm against Roo@@ sters scored a higher score than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and do not make any points something exciting ? &quot;
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;

&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , the terms used for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; p@@ ests in the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Stuttgart : out@@ runners of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest &quot;
met@@ eor@@ ologists warn against storm clouds in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm ocean air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful force is the pi@@ er of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic Ocean over the last few days . &quot;
violent storms and storms are expected particularly in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , even until Thursday , also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground sea circuit with goats from 60 to 90 hours kilometers . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the mass makes it : every two years the Autob@@ ots show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of the new regi@@ strations fell to this segment , according to the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) . &quot;
this is reflected in the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is Opel Astra , which will be held in autumn at the dealers . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; so that the volume model is sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents a start @-@ up below the largest competitor VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
date : 06 / 14 / 2009 Size : 10@@ 24x@@ 6@@ 83
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the main competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door Corsa . &quot;
&quot; a second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also available at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Astra at the IAA , what will be introduced to new compact cars next to the Astra ? &quot;
Rall@@ y@@ cross 2015 : Peugeot Hansen tri@@ on@@ f@@ ano in Canada
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five @-@ door in a conventional and a stressed spor@@ tive GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he also comes as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ publisher wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in the offer , however , a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is calculated according to manufacturer data at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 that is visible at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n exhaust went to the front part of the front : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;

the Chamber of App@@ eal must now clarify the amount of money .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; so they only spoke in April to a prisoner of damage , because he was locked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , un@@ worthy is the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had a decent lodging at a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; over three months , the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated resolution in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create this .
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;

this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 d@@ well@@ ings ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of housing , but above all in paid rental properties : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing is out of rent , and these particularly favorable flats will also apply to refugees . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; a lot too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to be created every year , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; as a result , scientists and federal farmers agree that there will also be more tax advantages for investing in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; both assumptions seem unrealistic : for example , the impact of a global shock is likely to vary from one region to another . in this issue on regional labour markets , Norbert Schanne employs novel methods in spatial econometrics to describe and forecast their development . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification to help them start their entry , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Migration Scienti@@ sts Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;

&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;

&quot; in the countries , students are being prepared without knowledge of knowledge in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by highly educated teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;

&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually remove the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who is professionally responsible for the new arri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , duties are also duties . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and be willing to work with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the read@@ iness to act against religious fundament@@ alism is also included . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to run such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the degradation of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law . &quot;

&quot; in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to track so many people with the limited output catalogue , which the asylum seek@@ ers act . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors usually do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are worse about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ters need to be taken over , she demands . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would be helped with more general medical points in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; under refugee camps , there are much more un@@ concerned disabilities , and the young people go about HIV @-@ education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other disease pictures German doctors of their training are clear , but Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; it is not so difficult to detect paras@@ ite infections or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis . &quot; &quot; and what concerns the medical check , it may even be alle@@ vi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even physicians . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and take examinations again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill , according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psych@@ otherap@@ ist Council ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;

&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , however , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , doctors or doctors who are not trained for psychological illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;

Macedonia : democracy in crisis or &quot; democracy in blo@@ om &quot; ? !
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ injured , but the video of the case quickly spread about social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also cor@@ rupted by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats , and warned them to accompany the speech of Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had rep@@ uted him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones , who warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; she warns the Parliament members that the Parliament &apos;s immun@@ ity ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;

&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and services business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and diversi@@ fied portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with his knu@@ ck@@ les or with injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the corresponding danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 league games in the last five playing times .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepted the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you strengthen your body and gain battle power , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body is stabili@@ sed , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career out of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League Season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow players who need a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al has clear favour@@ ites to continue through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; this year , it was the 10th in Zagreb . &quot;
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and continues to lead the association with his management to his first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to this in 2006 , but on the other hand , I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dreaming . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever has become more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year courtyard . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the issue , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 is the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle to cope with this challenge .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments while watching football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can relate to everyone , even though they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of phone chap@@ la@@ ins explained to me : &quot; &quot; my listening experience for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ confident , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often unable to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone can also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest at this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with celebration of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you &apos;re sitting around in Starbucks someone alone , give him a smile and say Hello . &quot;
you never know what &apos;s the difference between your friendship .

&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the A group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since they are not only aiming for the K.@@ O. rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs &apos;s missed opportunities in front of the gate . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold 2 : 2 oun@@ ces on their own place against Bor@@ deaux in the first league , but he was pushed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing door was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö @-@ defense before he joined Johan Wil@@ den in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off in order to achieve this level , joined An@@ glo@@ ff with nine national players in the field and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle of the middle . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ carriage and bad connections , not least of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; however , he pointed out a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who turned Di Maria into a shooting shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the fo@@ oth@@ ills ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored its sixth win after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thought that Mal@@ m@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent attack from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low , before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was able to finish a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film@@ making
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ american film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she won &apos;t be needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then you do it with the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with ins@@ ulting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian became captiv@@ ated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;

professional sports climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could close all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last part , climbing at a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first ath@@ lete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds , which made him a winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved or had more than 10,000 $ deserved or had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the executive producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the course at all , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;

&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , it receives the great degree of gra@@ tification . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he is upset about this .
he is just as happy to have what he did .
he was awarded the masses of awards .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aking at Minnesota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;

the Tw@@ ins w@@ asted a chance to climb up within one half of Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League wild@@ card place .
&quot; for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , as Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I will concentrate fully into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first race since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the wood well , &quot; &quot; said Cut@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , clearly looked better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double at the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks finished a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who broke a Two @-@ Run from the right @-@ wing shoot of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;

it was the first time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ les proposed a double play
&quot; after Detroit joined an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , is S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit has benefited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veteran , who had been kn@@ itted before the game from the injury list after having been missing more than a month because of a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I was getting rid of and felt that I would create some fairly good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they got the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 success with the runners in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers laid down in the second , achieved a One Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he did not have a very good beat , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third In@@ ning , before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came three races at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : Tiger &apos;s R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z expi@@ red due to injury of the litter .
&quot; he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of shoulder @-@ breaking , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;

&quot; but if he wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender line , it is often advised by them . &quot;
&quot; because man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar , especially su@@ cro@@ se . &quot;
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , Man@@ gos contain lots of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or firm and smell pleasant . &quot;
&quot; the color alone says nothing about how ripe fruit is - so , green man@@ gos can taste delicious . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives heart@@ y dishes a special note . &quot;
it reduces the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ y salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney is good for fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of City President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless pla@@ que in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ zed on the name of the German reform@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; on Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the working group of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the town of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in the secret of their faith . &quot;
the place will be visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was regarded as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; he received the city back then , as a desc@@ endant of sinn@@ ers . &quot;
his negative impressions should have rein@@ vigor@@ ated him in his later battle against Rome .
&quot; at the same time , Luther had initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment of the Western Church . &quot;
hammer Artists invested three years into personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpretations of bibli@@ ographical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motives . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equal to &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar has worked on his Bible project for which he has taken a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subjects of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; created are cycles that de@@ vote themes such as cross@@ ways , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments , or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; with this , he has fascinated many partners spont@@ ane@@ ously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible points on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible points by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus transl@@ ates into &quot; &quot; present contex@@ ts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original bi@@ ble of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Order . &quot;
&quot; then the up@@ bringing happened with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar &apos;s old re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work that , in order to be able to forgive me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterised by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have a bit of secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewer fall into the pictures , let them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art . &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I am not sure where you are getting your info , but great topic . I needs to spend some time learning more or understanding more . &quot;
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , opened on November 15 at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;

&quot; the decisive turn@@ out must , however , place the policy . &quot;
&quot; the German football federation has therefore expanded its refugee &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; stated Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UE@@ FA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal lists support this program .
&quot; already at this weekend , the 36 professionals start a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Leverk@@ usen &apos;s sports chief Rudi Völ@@ ler , the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every one , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to use football federal lists , no , we have to use our radiation force , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have been so incredibly successful , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequ@@ in that will look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was easy , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a lucky fact that the designer has changed his attitude to a show of his person at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he had been on the contrary , for : &quot; for me an exhibition was a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who wrote history , without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was carried out : to eat the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example . &quot;

&quot; he stands for the first , delicate , fashionable side@@ kick of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he used his ted@@ dy BH@@ s and clothes , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; with a doll to play , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;

&quot; he ste@@ ered fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich . &quot;

&quot; for his first own fashion show , he couldn &apos;t pay the models . &quot;

jewellery instead of curtain - Plau@@ ener lace as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dering machines in and around Plau@@ en therefore to make a meter . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a great deal for customers , for example , for blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone works no longer today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ kom@@ it@@ ze Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Plau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a larger role , was then pushed out by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now being re @-@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewellery , with accessories such as bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ sti@@ cs , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
&quot; if you do not use any niche in the textile industry in Germany , it is no longer on the market . &quot;
