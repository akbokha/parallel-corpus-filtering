Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friends .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of international agreement and Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , it should also go to the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal of the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ orate . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacted the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officers found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was written on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , has already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lam@@ b had made the wounded emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took the life when the police took him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities always try to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motivated . &quot;
&quot; the authors on both ends of the state have published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , said , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teacher . &quot;
students said that they enjoyed their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in one of him written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers are 17 members , and many students visited the courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some n@@ eig@@ ns to problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lam@@ b praised , said , he seemed too little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lam@@ b told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lam@@ b had asked the Delta State University to provide evidence for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; in this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the employment policy of the university found that the promotion , for the Lam@@ b had worked so hard , for him no guarantee for an automatic way to an adjustment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that the Lam@@ b cannot answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police took later Lam@@ bs track when he entered the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car still ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lam@@ b began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and signed geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 when they met with friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
he was at the time of the wom@@ b .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lam@@ b said , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; after three years , Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had two years ago , both on a summer @-@ year market . &quot;
later they played one or another gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss night at night 5 September last time after Lam@@ b had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic voice . &quot;
there was no evidence that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were on the rooms and sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ ed together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of sh@@ ear . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a German professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and took about 900 people , including lect@@ urers , employees , students and members of the community on a cand@@ l@@ esti@@ ck memorial celebration . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake part , while the Univers@@ iti &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be recorded on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; Amy and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lam@@ b had shot the emergency call after he had shot , and that Lam@@ b had been shot in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two were ever married . &quot;

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for Roy@@ als , and I think that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually be clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;

&quot; UN chief says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot;
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will cause violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support the fin@@ ders of a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , United Kingdom and France - at the edge of the ministers meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ tt@@ ed that the meetings in the Council , and within the Syrian people , and the regional powers , would make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; Ban urged the five permanent members to cope with the same solidarity and unity , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 responses that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at surveys , it has not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , from which none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth recognise Tr@@ umps through@@ put assets and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current demand values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps Any@@ time values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump sent his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in early August , it was 52 per cent . &quot;
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .

&quot; in a survey of CNN &apos;s last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they would be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 per cent , which tell the same about tr@@ ump . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be candidate . &quot;
a majority of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bomb@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Iranian voters believe that the real temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first pre @-@ country state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a job , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; however , 44 percent that he does not have the personality to effectively run his office , and almost six of 10 independent say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; if they put their money back , Republican voters keep Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say according to a survey by CNN / The last week , four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four of ten ended their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;

&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everyone . &quot;
some experts suggest that the split field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University beginning September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ ested . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ zu and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a fla@@ w@@ less majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say that they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course it can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said , that they leave the door open to change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign against two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rape &quot; , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse was held in the public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bomb@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s decisive Hez@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and damage the new @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do . &quot;

a lucky hits from Thomas Müller took the way to a comp@@ iler 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ akos Pir@@ äus - then ran out .
a sovereign win of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have captured a dream start in the &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won the winner in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ akos in hot atmosphere thanks to g@@ arbage ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth track success in series is to be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; Müller received his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guided tours of Olympi@@ akos @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who was able to pass a f@@ lange of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria captain Philipp L@@ earned in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich thought . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shine .
&quot; Pir@@ äus has won his youngest six home games in the Royal Age , among them against renowned clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , with their open efforts , but often too plain to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks have often been initiated by acting on the left side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely penet@@ rated against the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Müller had more luck than his f@@ lange from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as Olympi@@ akos Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with the knee was par@@ ked ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria used their usual domin@@ ance game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to put needle sti@@ ff@@ ness . &quot;

&quot; so for example , when he was a kiss of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te distra@@ ction ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before that , Guardi@@ ola left a Vier@@ erk@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; after the final training of the World Cup , Matthias Sam@@ mer said , &quot; &quot; Who wants to make something different from it , this is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the first exchange , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the alleged Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; it was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) , and 13 minutes later everything was clear , by Elf@@ ess Müller still set up one another . &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it came to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a small group of partly war@@ med Bavaria fans in her audience block , the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus had prov@@ oked the security forces , and went with strokes against the Munich supporters . &quot;

&quot; if you don &apos;t smoke , it doesn &apos;t hurt only the lungs , but also the teeth - that lays a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;

&quot; for eleven years , Su@@ fj@@ an Stev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to him , a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells of various places that he always records on the map , showing his min@@ u@@ zi@@ lian and tender songs . &quot;
&quot; where they arose , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative Ir@@ rer . &quot;

the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will lift up the first of his six questions shortly after noon , with his performance from the media and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity . &quot;
&quot; he called &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot;
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , for it comes to his appointment as a member of the shadow cable and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour president , on Tuesday , during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the center of several titles stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ns has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have &quot; in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he accepted the &quot; hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two news@@ night program , he asked the Labour leader to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ns , &quot; regardless of his faith that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ party of the parliam@@ ent@@ arian party supported him as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour , &quot; &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , that Labour will make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether . &quot;
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow and R@@ ent Minister , that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch Box in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions of Mr. Cameron has given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the fra@@ grant of the Prime Minister is the front , and that he is going to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality , and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers will be represented , if he does not participate - for example if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he asked John Ber@@ man , the speaker of the sub @-@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; since they had been broadcast in television in 1990 , the question@@ naire was regarded as the most important barrier of a driver and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position under his parliamentary counter@@ part , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; by the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to strike twice by the arbit@@ rator , with Har@@ rison : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen as he sm@@ iled a tennis ra@@ cket after a crane hit a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing , about which I &apos;m pretty , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he did extremely well in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term commitment to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team concentrated on the competition , and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of the public , he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . some time outside of the ramp@@ ant that he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and ri@@ dden the south border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all the parties trying to stop illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants moved in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and the Serbian officials re@@ acted with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose up .
&quot; as a police helicopter over them , the migrants &quot; opening the border ! &quot; and sm@@ ashed ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some pointed out of protest food and water .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister stated , &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would be sent back to Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; it must take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the Tur@@ bul@@ ations at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the transferred Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not set up his hopes on a bal@@ lot campaign of Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities announced more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a barb@@ ed dra@@ h@@ tz@@ a@@ us along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees who are looking for a better life , and not war @-@ fle@@ eing , who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ tern in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , which is expected to be expected for next week , but reporter from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come through by corrupt the fence , they are now in police custody , and are accused of crimes against the new laws . &quot;

&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced that he has been appointed for the Presi@@ dency , receives 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months prior to the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supports supporters in their choice than those of the other candidates .

&quot; Clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has whis@@ pered , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit growth in Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; for example , half of the democratic voters of the local elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support them with some precau@@ tions , and other 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons are up @-@ to @-@ date supporters especially of you .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say this about their nickname &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons supports supporters in an open question , why they want the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is mentioned . &quot;

&quot; since the Vice @-@ President has a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ mire , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see it in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons , more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Bi@@ den does not decide to can@@ di@@ ate the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head raised ahead of S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this number of 78 per cent last month has fallen . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ fish@@ est . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , the Democratic voters call questions about the voters . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results with some important features in the elections of their party .
&quot; multi@@ fac@@ tions consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in general , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; for questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as foreign Minister , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it does not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 , that say that their views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than in May . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder deposits were filed against five persons . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital that has helped to death .
&quot; officials said he was charged with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go on a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g told him about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g had been power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes to make his symptoms too goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , said police sign Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ sils began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in general over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a car copy , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , hull and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;

&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of a criminal attacks and education of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to be responsible for the involved persons , but if there is an organization that has been officially or in@@ officially - this is anch@@ ored , we will also draw these to the account@@ ability , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;

this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; a interest rate is coming , and the house will fall into dis@@ regard , ren@@ ders for bonds , and the economy will gli@@ de into a recession . &quot;
we know .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will be .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only low guidance for the economy . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve , when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the time that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated due to a interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in an announcement to customers . &quot;
&quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights but still at low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that seem to be many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there is no effect . &quot;
here is a list of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the adoption of interest increases can be vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may perhaps reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study , which happened to interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ded later in the cycle cycle , and the return begins to decrease . &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not accelerate and accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in a interest rate of the F@@ ed .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in a so fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different &quot; , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all proceeds from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is done . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the cycle cycle , the bond returns immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to ren@@ di@@ ties between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a down@@ fall of the curve . &quot;
&quot; highly @-@ consuming bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income curve is flat , lending , and the vol@@ atility has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and entire industry , companies , which take advantage of the bigger part of their business activity in the USA , will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debt will become worse because a rising dollar makes its products more expensive in the global market and the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond very positive for three months after an initial interest in interest , &quot; &quot; said Goldman Sach@@ s analysts in a report for customers . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder it must be worked to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British did less about classical music . &quot;

the accused is not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted because of the ministry .
&quot; in May , he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation . &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel was cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants were allowed in the years 2006 to 2011 , which were used in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , he was a member of the branch of Georg Heinrich II Kochersperger , USA . he was a member of the branch of Georg Heinrich II Kochersperger , USA . &quot;
the sports facilities are also indic@@ ted because of financial transactions .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; the defence of the un@@ faithful , the defence of the association , was not a part of an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports facilities would have been charged only allow@@ ance and the sports club , which led them from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va bet@@ ru@@ bles around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ illing ( R@@ d . 44@@ .000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; we will continue the club further or block us ? &quot; , &quot; one of the accused , in the bread @-@ based large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial system . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have proposed money , our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it may only be made no debt . &quot;

&quot; for this reason , package and non @-@ detail prints were also explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the two def@@ endants shared the accounts and spar@@ es , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not detailed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial support , but it is important to have been only the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;

&quot; that was the case , the def@@ endants said . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant , and was not known according to the association . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; then he thought , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened , nobody would have had something of this money , the prosec@@ utor was in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused was informed , right @-@ handed to the function@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; you are all out of the tailor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the function@@ ary , he never received a c@@ ents salary , he only calculated mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; in Di@@ ets , he added to the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ notes on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade has been raised interest rates or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey under 80 econom@@ ists that were questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will be able to do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 per cent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank might leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ b , executive staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is a relatively good performance , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to raise itself on an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday

&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I am afraid of my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house , but no one will distur@@ b it , but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the An@@ ru@@ fer to his name , but he did not have him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as a police , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 , saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;

&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was married by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married to seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;

&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who was 19 , and they were destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , had been with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said , &quot;

&quot; during this , Louis van Ga@@ al will not be able to play it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope not that Sha@@ w can play in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a backward attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was built in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought into the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later , and then in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then really plays fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
&quot; in the changing cabin , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;

you can judge for yourself when I say that a Elf@@ ess and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; a post on Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; &quot; thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back again . &quot;

&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very serious injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very serious injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so that it looked out when he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry .

certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that will soon learn to all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
it is because you are maybe David Cameron .
&quot; as he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , who was published in 1971 , was approved by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to have a picture or message that we have missed . &quot;
&quot; all beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposedly describing the story of the book , instead of presenting an contents of the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the re@@ formed city of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , who was a real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel died and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet susp@@ icious enough , the text reads as the summary of the Lor@@ ax Films that will be presented on the Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he doesn &apos;t seem to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the act of the book so little familiar . here is a un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the rich @-@ gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ sely , Th@@ ought stri@@ pped Once @-@ ler in spite of the protests of the nam@@ ens@@ hr@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , schn@@ ur@@ r@@ b@@ ous being , &quot; which is in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most probably , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times a child . &quot;
a down@@ ing @-@ street spokes@@ woman said that the text was likely to come from Camer@@ ons voting office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons , but there were no other immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der , England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I told this - players are their own best players . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have leng@@ th@@ ened the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully beat further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even though he did not have such good performances , and this surprised me not ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test stroke gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to return home and down@@ ward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that you can rise , England was first Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of making mo@@ een to cook in addition to Cook , which would bring an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , and I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ player of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests during the first drop before he joined the Op@@ ener .
he has done three hundred races immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the train@@ ers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the train@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have any problems . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and Team@@ actors do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you have to think that as with players their jobs depend on their results .
such decisions are not made easy .

foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ a friend told me that some member states , so deeply rooted in various crises , like the EU it is now and not always from its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disturbing changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of itself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants an outside of the UK - &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t want us alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it is no matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an allies , but it has been in power and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , as it is for the exagger@@ ated long @-@ term exp@@ ul@@ sion like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande looks at its re @-@ election or its release in 2017 .
he is also a verb@@ ati@@ m force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are going to tear a leg to help the Sel@@ fie @-@ British should be used to prevent Scotland from the UK - something that they do not want , because most of the similar tendencies have tendencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may not be inten@@ sely helpful comments , completely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend . &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the new trial . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 @-@ years . &quot;
&quot; in all his rever@@ ence , Ed Mili@@ band , who had his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ chi@@ ef@@ ly foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ domestic countries , who possess most of our great newspapers . &quot;
&quot; in fact Tony Blair thought about it , but set out that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you have a better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he rejected Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ anger because Blair had rejected the principle of the European Constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never been temp@@ ted to him .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he would no longer need time for me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 years to repeat , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can last but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position to Europe is - I think it is friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ arb@@ stoff @-@ tendency and the wil@@ ful plu@@ mage of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can possibly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week , said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year old , when his old father himself tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet without too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow comrades and members after all the reports on the evening evening . &quot;
&quot; in the age of TV around the clock is important and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the presentation campaign for a self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks safe .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on the EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not start the campaign for the exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin have lost political capital - they have also susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British unless this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I would like to be reminded by something of British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that E cigarettes less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; Report Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have asked the power handling of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a leading articles in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month handle the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily strong foundation , &quot; based on the PH@@ E its most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the asser@@ tions are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the efficacy of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expected that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ c@@ rit@@ eria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) to conduct their opinions about the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products . the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from a E @-@ cigarette manufacturers , but not the financing that he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champions , of which some also offer a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management took part in PH@@ E . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen@@ ing &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; he wrote McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
&quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that there is no evidence that there is no evidence that e cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director for Health and Well @-@ Being at PH@@ E , said that the claims of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smokers die in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to this are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to the public about what is proof and what does not , especially if there is much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking the National Health System costs two billion USD per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear prec@@ lin@@ ation of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;

&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ issions .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial contemporary window against the most popular shows of their rivals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to contact Channel 4 for six years , with the BBC in contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I do not think of a good idea for a good idea , you should at least give up their production at least on programs that do not make or order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach a wide range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , given both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm to this . &quot;
I would like to see how this public television should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame on the hunt for reviews , because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture took place in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they are not able to measure their tasks , and they can argue if they have created their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ liter@@ ated programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where nobody ever wanted to see .
&quot; to the broadcast charge Johnson said to the committee , &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all that you receive a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for people who have a lot of money for 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should take a look at the public television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; for the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances to make everything online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes can change the direction at the moment when they are exposed to sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by compens@@ ators of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes are changing the direction in the moment , in which they have high frequencies for the human hearing too high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
impul@@ ses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
read more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said , the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that causes electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of humans to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; F@@ aden@@ worms react normally not to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ on@@ enk@@ ins , and in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these I@@ onic channels and activate the cells they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ ds , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ on@@ enk@@ ins wear . &quot;
&quot; when ultrasound is applied to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by micro@@ bli@@ sters and transmit into the worms where they switch to the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and turn off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be revealed in the brain &apos;s desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen enorm@@ ously , and can be sent back to the brain from above . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added . &quot;

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install Inst@@ all . &quot;
&quot; some are encountered after installing problems , since they receive an error message that is missing that the &quot; &quot; software upgrade failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users are recommended to wait until the exit is back or try to update on iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do so when you use a special tool , to delete apps and then rest@@ art it as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update , or is in the proximity of a charging device , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t make sure that the update will be continued because the phone may turn off on half @-@ way and can lead to a break of the updates . &quot;

at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
&quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot;
&quot; one of these men cried out to the young people , and struck this with the fist into the face . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the border controls on our south border , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to establish an asylum application can also be &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration streams , even not about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously communic@@ ated to Slovenia , including Slovenia , to travel to Austria and Germany , and in other circumstances , cor@@ rid@@ ors will also build up cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already highly controlled as an external border . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to avoid its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , in east cro@@ ati@@ a at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles meet with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also rescue services and the Red Cross were already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country has about 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses made from Pres@@ evo to the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , there is a first bus with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses are expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were the whole night from around 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could now be expected to come from observers already in the previous Balkans route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a bit further west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stated that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; details Ludwig , Udo ; Brautzsch , Hans @-@ Ulrich Has the International Frag@@ mentation of German Exports Pass@@ ed its Peak ? Inter@@ economics , Vol . 43 ( 3 ) 2008 3 External Publications X - - &quot;
there are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partners put a good testimony to the country since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Hungarian border , about 300 refugees are still stuck . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high refugee .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
volunteers rates migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are characterized by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not approximate : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian border . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent in the border region . &quot;

the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that it is an un@@ disputed third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentives by the close to zero @-@ current interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they are solid , the recent turbul@@ ences of the global financial markets are afraid to rein@@ force this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification for the global market , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they have to go very far in order to so@@ ften the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argue that an interest increase would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence of 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow disappearance of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August was slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; despite inflation constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it due to the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot;
but the financial markets on the whole world sent to the end of the last month after China had used its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average worth more than 16 % under its maximum level , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would rise to global growth . &quot;
&quot; in this month , the market has recovered slightly in this month , while the Dow is now almost 10 % under the ho@@ ch of May . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would not have occurred in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end of the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly struggling with each other , they can not only monitor the developments at other locations but also advise other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;

&quot; Lack@@ er , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which uses interest for interest in the years 1998 / 1999 , as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower their Leit@@ z@@ ins to lower 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the USA , &quot; Lack@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts back . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only set aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like the market crash in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she has fear of a interest in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act does not contain the double mandate , and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe that they should start the time . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pä@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pap@@ al organisation Spr@@ S tries to clarify how important good nutrition during bre@@ ast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted on breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation to the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system . &quot;

&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;

&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was in turn around the Dach@@ stein , which is prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the building plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan was not permitted &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with Bern@@ ri@@ eder &apos;s common rule in the rule of liberation orders rather restri@@ ctive . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;

they compete with a weak citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .

&quot; in this way , 140@@ .000 apartments are missing . &quot;

&quot; according to Hungary , there is practically no flow more , since then more refugees choose the way about Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in Zagreb , Zagreb announces the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les . &quot;
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister , and when it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;

the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees fled to Croatia in order to get to Europe from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of the Croatian television channel RTL . &quot;
Hungary had sealed his border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which came in force on the same day , make this extraordinary asylum procedure in Hungary practically su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility .
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;

&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at the border of Ser@@ bi@@ ens to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most of the media reports , according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and ta@@ xis in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t viol@@ ate border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , there are other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v Civil War in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance will soon create a secure passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , however , after the closing of the border , there is hardly any more refugees . &quot;

the daily asylum seek@@ ers are supposed to be cut down there .

&quot; these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas . &quot;
&quot; even the poultry will have to realize that the &quot; &quot; yellow &quot; &quot; country , which she invited and welcomed , is nothing more than another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee currents and the near winter , to establish decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

Konrad has to do all his hands with the refugee policy .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to stop quot@@ as for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got the grip .
&quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great work , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; masterpiece . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad calculated with a demand of 85@@ .000 quartz in the he@@ ur@@ ous year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , the next few weeks will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the co@@ ven@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not wet without the ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already been in talks with the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art experts .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees . &quot;

&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of logic : her desire to return to the home , failed in the Bavarian state where the Pal@@ at@@ inate was one . &quot;
&quot; he did not accept tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;

&quot; all three women have om@@ itted in ly@@ ric ways , why Wood is the perfect man and knew his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner . &quot;

I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house visit was clear that Wood will be &quot; &quot; A &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now pre@@ ordered on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not she was , she was hel@@ pless . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; 4 people killed , after police raid on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal shooting &quot;
&quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police rub@@ bed in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief District Attorney , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , while some of you were war@@ med by stones and fire bombs . &quot;

&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber @-@ fin , of which is known that they can kill , but who traditionally used as less lethal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;

&quot; the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for refugees . &quot;

&quot; for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a report on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out in humans that are obes@@ e with a body @-@ mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I about 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers used in Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates , which have been collected in a study since 2007 , and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c and stomach mu@@ gs - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this surgery , decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained at those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also supervised the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; at the same time , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is considered to be the best among 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; according to the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish the mort@@ ality in five years , so the conduc@@ tive researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also contains average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns in the BM@@ I ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.4 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit for surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , there were obes@@ e people who have under@@ gone a obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously , as soon as the patient with his BM@@ I was between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have accumulated their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders called to stop violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is admi@@ rable in the refugee crisis , but the situation is not adequate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; despite the Dal@@ ai Lama Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for those Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented George B@@ ush@@ s &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and presented that the violent reaction of the US was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my appl@@ ause in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he sat down violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of suspension dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the USA report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lowed strongly alcoholic hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , reported the poison control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; Lop@@ ez CNN said . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children may drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some they do to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ iny in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink due to a cheap experience .
young people have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be caught by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ked .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es which are very attractive for children . &quot;
hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison center in the hospital of Kansas , the transm@@ itter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would have no si@@ ck whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children get it , it is a fast way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after earthquake in the school , was brought to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was prescribed by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te their words and was not able to go when they arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowed by hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ ylene alcohol , which was used as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three pupils of the fourth grade in the state of New York , their &quot; &quot; painted &quot; &quot; teacher in the state of New York , submitted their &quot; &quot; teachers &quot; &quot; by anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and burned them out of their room .
&quot; the police looked at the negoti@@ ated plan as &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; and rejected discipl@@ ined measures to the school authority . &quot;

tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you will receive access .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for .
&quot; they understood that they would have better form@@ ulate it , but they still think that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international reporter is present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations work against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
&quot; and from this perspective , I will see him die . &quot;
I cannot claim to be real objective .
it will give other rep@@ orters to which you can turn .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying to die .

&quot; Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he climbed on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive Kob@@ alt test in Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept 18 months due to the spy accus@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want to see it &quot; &quot; I see how to high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have spent a long time to eat but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; Moody said . &quot;

&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I &apos;m going to go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to be raised , and I want my owners to think that I try to try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised criticism of the Tac@@ os of his player as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites .
&quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a very little comment to the Storm team , after his crew had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample sample &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land did not have to be &quot; good &quot; in rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said that she was concent@@ rating on her &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers at his team will be confident in his team , as it seemed to be worried that they were worried about the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about the fight , when she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles on a real focus , and that has provided us the trend towards us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team . he is probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this is getting up again to this season .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminded that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday night , and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George has been critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divorce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like this . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it went to the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher score than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and no points are a little bit of ten@@ sion@@ ing ? &quot;
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the game plans . &quot;
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will be able to meet them in a phase . &quot;
the Storm team has been released on this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park .

&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly important : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations fell according to Kraft@@ fahrt Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment . &quot;
this is also reflected on the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented in this year . &quot;

&quot; Opel presents a start @-@ up of the largest competitors VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra has a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we create this . &quot;
what is coming to Germany is the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all at affordable rental objects : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments from the rental price , and around these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; a lot too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments have to be created , and the co@@ ven@@ ant would have to invest in height of 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; as a result , scientists and federal governments agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualification to assist them during the entry , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find it in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Migration researchers Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn : from the labour ban for refugees for recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while it was formerly a work ban for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months , as well as the resi@@ dency of asylum seek@@ ers on a residence . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies show that jobs are most common by personal contacts .
&quot; the building of networks is therefore , therefore , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the Königs@@ weg to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wat@@ ered parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ennial parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ able , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family to convince the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration hand@@ sheets are distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ating the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate will try to increase the training capacities - for example by enabling more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared without any German knowledge in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ umpf@@ es from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , there is no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or commem@@ or@@ ating the studies - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) , but now abandoned its position . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; refugees could be reli@@ ed on access to the university . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ uth , there will be no services after the asylum seek@@ er law , if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , there is no B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , because it does not fall under the circle of the b@@ anded persons . &quot;
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 3 ( Southern Europe ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 4 ( North European ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 5 ( Cyrillic ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 6 @-@ i ( Arabic )
&quot; however , this funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; in future , Islam will play an important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should take over the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important to be the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , duties are also duties . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must be in clear contact with some and willing to work together with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the willingness to take place against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bavarian Broad@@ casting . &quot;
he proposed to translate the basic law to Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today than today . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the breakdown of discrimination and racism is urgent . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany has been an anti @-@ discrimination system and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow , like the NSU novel series , systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities . &quot;
&quot; the same chances for all : what Mig@@ rant &apos;s organizations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans have been calling for a long time and why international agreements such as the Anti @-@ rac@@ ist Convention , must be in reality when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to supply the previously expected refugees medi@@ cally , the doctor says Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities , we create this , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , there must be additional money into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for all arri@@ vals at the registration of health cards . &quot;
&quot; as a result , services could be calculated later by the German federal states . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to track so many people with the limited power catalogue that fores@@ ees asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors do not have to create the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been demonstrated , migrants are worse than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , they need to be taken over by interpre@@ ting costs . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees could also be helped with more general medical attention in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; among refugee camps , there is much more uncomfortable disabilities , and the young people go to HIV @-@ education . &quot;
&quot; with some other disease pictures , German doctors of their training are clear , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; it is not so difficult to recognize the paras@@ ite , or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even physicians . &quot;
&quot; in order to practice cultivation , however , they would have to prove their qualification as well as possible examinations . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany , according to the estimates of the federal psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically ill : most of them suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; in particular , refugee children are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
&quot; a recently published study conducted by TU Munich , that every fifth Syrian refugee population is traumati@@ zed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; who in a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering , among other things , is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respiratory , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ ps and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration , strong irrit@@ ability and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , the early treatment is necessary , said Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees still receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; however , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can place an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social groups , experts or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ understand@@ ings , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new staging &quot; passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst turns back to the traditions of the cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to attract every age group in the b@@ ann of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Tier@@ teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ i stage .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst . &quot;
the gift to play is the family so in the blood .
&quot; it is important to pick up people from their everyday life and take them for two hours in a completely different world , &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ kind cocktail with world city fla@@ ir , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities at the just 3 000 km long tour , this fla@@ ir can now experience this fla@@ ir . &quot;
the programme of the cir@@ cus convinc@@ es with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm in her b@@ ann . &quot;
the Cas@@ till@@ o Brothers understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the St@@ um@@ m@@ films , it wants to take the Cuban duo . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s bodies in the storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tip and artic@@ ulation . &quot;
to balance with the wheel on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake men fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghtened at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little other and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ uses in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it is not good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ ste &quot; , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly named , is derived from the eyes of every wish of the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the beast does not feel , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the man@@ ege . &quot;
so the top command@@ ment is : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jumbo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
&quot; the two animals have lived eight years , and nothing has happened . &quot;
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jumbo da , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ ra is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , it is likely to be something . &quot;
&quot; one thing is sure , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 p.m. to his performances .
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. . &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5@@ pm , prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal show is open from 10 to 18 : 00 . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down at the beginning of the year by a podium . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ injured , but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also ch@@ ased by the claims of MPs of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech of Mr Mu@@ gabe with b@@ hr@@ s. weiterlesen &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;
&quot; last month , they had stopped him and stopped him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians send SMS messages to their mobile phones they warned , Mr. Mu@@ ch &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; she warns the Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the president said that Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i led the party &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to expand 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will split into two listed companies , and separate the computer and printer business from its quicker @-@ growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job cuts leads to a burden of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chair@@ person and Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and extended portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; will be focusing on providing un@@ approved , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; as an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring plan to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies achieve a better performance . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his ank@@ le , or with the injuries that he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true of purely medical sight , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
&quot; the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut , six years ago . &quot;
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 lig@@ ations in the last five play times .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that she has been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from a violation , you have a certain period of time to strengthen your body and gain combat power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will take a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns up a rotation within the team . &quot;
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to treat a little break break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing places with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season was started .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake , where the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 was measured . &quot;
&quot; this year , it was the 10th in Zagreb . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains from the distant hope to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never been folded at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to the year 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dreaming . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates under young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ Ho@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in the effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of putting the culture into question , to seek help , if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a current study of more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressive symptoms showed that when the body had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery had doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends are the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media led communication , with its focus on style about substance , the response is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently , money cannot really buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality that sh@@ ook through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler , frequent hu@@ gs , moments during soccer look in comfortable chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men can definitely get back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the telephone conversation I explained to me : ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ confident , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
men who contact us are often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old word &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when one speaks about problems . &quot;
friends are one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term handling mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective external guide status can help people in moments of despair also like the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you &apos;re sitting in Starbucks someone alone , give him a smile and tell me Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
&quot; di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , mal@@ m@@ ö &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani after his hits against Mal@@ m@@ ö .
&quot; di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , passing Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players , who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally exceeded their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k in the group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish master , as they are not only the qualification for the K.@@ O. rounds , but an improvement on the path to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he later started in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he started his own career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or to win in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bor@@ deaux in the first league , but he was exposed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing door was called the man who was taken over the next stage in Europe when he was taken over the next stage of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö @-@ Defence , before he closed to Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was raised with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle of the middle . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G was sometimes on , with some mis@@ p@@ tions and bad connections , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts in the first half , and then was abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ launch . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he had much more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who turned Di Maria into a revol@@ t , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . he achieved his sixth season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all thought that Mal@@ m@@ ö was able to return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result was able to keep the final result low before the waiting list of Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league that didn &apos;t have the same level . &quot;
the quali@@ fiers are not sufficient .
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the Chinese State President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in the film
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she will not need behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke out as the necessity of alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it at the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with ins@@ ult un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . &quot; okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian turned out . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Pro@@ du@@ cent@@ ages Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , which is beaten by her white no@@ od@@ les . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; at the end of us could give something , what we do not want . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos;s first champion
&quot; the first Ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could close all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season fin@@ ales , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last part , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time , which he was the first ath@@ lete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of the win of the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I never had more than 10,000 $ deserved or life , &quot; Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the director Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the course at all at all , does not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price , and the life changes , it receives the great gra@@ ti@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t believe that he h@@ ears anything about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he was awarded by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac had just felt as if they would have changed the rolls .

Detroit Tig@@ ers schlei@@ fe to Minnesota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; earlier , they were one of the best teams in Bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spoiler , played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minnesota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins w@@ aved a chance for Ascen@@ sion within a game of the Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so hard to touch over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support as Detroit three times in the first two , then once again in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 internal and enabled three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw every game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to focus on the game . &quot;
&quot; the designer @-@ designed Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first lap since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6 July . &quot;
&quot; he has forged the impact , &quot; &quot; said Com@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
with three races at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game again .
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the In@@ ning with a double at the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man , with whom he was confronted , before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who was the right @-@ wing Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the closing run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe into a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was that in the Major League leading 27 times in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit , at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings a Insurance @-@ Run , wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , S@@ ano has three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit also benefited from the start of the game from a still not mov@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two inner@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ ans who had been kn@@ itted before the game of the vulner@@ ability list after having had fallen more than one month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt comfortable when I went out and felt that I would make some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third in@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes delivered a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , what the threat ended . &quot;
&quot; in the second , a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he is not particularly well beaten , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , had no points in the third In@@ ning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , it came to three races at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;

&quot; the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Kol@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot;
the name of the Church of the Evangel@@ ical Chur@@ ches in Rome has been requested .

hammer artists invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost updated the introduction and updated bi@@ blical texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt , which was form@@ ulated in 150 moti@@ fs , has form@@ ulated his own personal interpretation of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equal to &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : the respective themes are adapted , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; some three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic choice from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that are dedicated to themes such as cross @-@ country , p@@ aces , command@@ ments , or fa@@ ther@@ land . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has focused on painting with the respective bee sites . &quot;
&quot; it is interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible points and thus transl@@ ates into current inter@@ relations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ ally mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are nest@@ led between the original biography of Martin Luther and one of the artist &apos;s original biography , which form@@ ulates his personal thought to the respective situation . &quot;
the jewellery leather@@ cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old per@@ si@@ sts twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Order . &quot;
&quot; since the education has happened with the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work that , in order to carry me back again with the Lord Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help art in fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; &quot; perception of image worlds is em@@ bos@@ sed today by rec@@ l@@ ame , and that is loud . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is disp@@ ens@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to leave the viewer into the images , let them discover , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art , &quot; &quot; I like how to compreh@@ end with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old did not respect the Bible , but also selected for him important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that the biggest challenge of our country has since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interested in any individual interest to get this issue in the grip , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ki@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the law office and meet the Chancellor Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the topic is safe to play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can help and wool .
but the decisive turn@@ out is to put politics .
the German football federation therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; says Ki@@ sbach on the edge of the UE@@ FA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal lists support this program .
&quot; already at this weekend , the 36 professionals put a clear sign when it takes place on the left Tri@@ kot@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) to help the imprint &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Leverk@@ us@@ ens Sports Director Rudi Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every one , no one can walk away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football federal lists , no , we have to use our radi@@ os , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already been so incredibly successful to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;

&quot; for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework , and where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany is about to use an international level that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 km / hour is raised . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government also wants to use a change in the Vienna Convention , which has not only fores@@ een the people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; for automated driving , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to the study , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , vehicles on public roads are still expected to be expected . &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for a duck .
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .

I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past , it was easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;

&quot; in fact , he was on the contrary , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already been made in Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s work , who wrote the fashion story without ever completing a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total art work for which much effort was run : to get up the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated to a sty@@ list . &quot;

that needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage range between the fresh@@ est ideas of designer and the companies , which must be considered economically viable , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;

XI urges the economy to open the world wide for the world

&quot; to promote innovation and reforms , new momentum and vitality will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to control the market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , support of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created to identify sectors and companies that do not come into question . &quot;
the system will be tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance since the market has a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarant@@ e@@ eing a right @-@ state business environment and designed the market open , the statement said . &quot;
&quot; the government will also pun@@ ish control over the powers of the company , and ensure that companies decide how to carry out their business . &quot;

&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment , and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it will be easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by making the requirements optimized and the application process will be facilit@@ ated . &quot;

&quot; according to Wolf sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ tian or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; were raised by one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish . &quot;

&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU according to Food@@ watch wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the reduction in sewage is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ cury is one of the most poison@@ ous heavy metals , which are strongly influenced by the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Federal Government warns that &quot; low quantities of especially in un@@ born damage of the nervous system can cause . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Environment Ministry , the Federal Environment Ministry declar@@ es that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly due to coal burning into the environment .
&quot; the German coal @-@ fired power stations viol@@ ated more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of Germany &apos;s total amount of mer@@ cury in Germany . &quot;
