&quot; the agreement could be closed until the total amount of the cred@@ itor countries to be closed to the mechanism of membership , namely within a total limit of 2,7@@ 25 billion b@@ illing units ; this is equivalent to 50 % of all future read@@ ability for member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions now may be called the BI@@ Z ready for the application . &quot;
&quot; at each Stand@@ by @-@ credit the BI@@ Z would first take an obligation for two years , whereby the possibility of renew@@ als will be pun@@ ished , without having a total of five years exceeded . &quot;
&quot; during the opening of the loans , as well as on their levels , the BI@@ Z would charge a cre@@ d@@ an opening period . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first pulling lines are not made before exp@@ ir@@ ation of a month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; the accordion would be made available at the BI@@ Z in conclusion of the agreement , very likely in U.S. dollar ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the means of the bank expected three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those which refer to the B@@ IS at the appropriate time under similar terms and conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely comply with the market leaders . &quot;
&quot; however , when the BI@@ Z has to proc@@ ure the necessary means itself on the market itself , then it could reach a maximum for the use of interest rates , which is equivalent to an appropriate margin of the Lib@@ or . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would inform me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the BI@@ Z could include Stand@@ by @-@ credit agreements with central banks of the cred@@ itor countries , if the banks provide a relevant request . &quot;

C ) which are not free of blood @-@ trans@@ usions transmitted diseases as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
the blood of blood is as@@ eptic ; the blood is led by a closed @-@ ster@@ ile tube @-@ system into a ster@@ ile bottle which was fil@@ med in an ster@@ ile bottle .
&quot; after completion of the blood pressure , the bottle is immediately shut down and cool to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it may only be opened immediately before the use of blood . &quot;
&quot; men@@ gen@@ ders may not be allowed to exceed 220 ml per l@@ iter ( 220 ml per l@@ iter ) , and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ os@@ concentration may not exceed 97 g per l@@ iter . &quot;
the blood @-@ group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to determine the blood of blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by the investigation of blood cells at a new sample of the disp@@ enser .
as far as the blood @-@ group determination in individual countries are standardized or recommended procedures are applicable .
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use when specific investigations have the default in the default , the Anti@@ gene C , D , Du and E . &quot;
the blood intended after this Convention is intended to be used only to the receiver of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human full power is in ster@@ ile , sle@@ epy bottle of micro@@ organisms and keep up to its use on a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during testing and transport necessary times , which is at least 30 minutes to cool back on 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentration of human red blood cells is a unity of human full power , from which the largest part of plas@@ ma has been removed . &quot;
&quot; it contains all red blood cells of unity , from which it has been won ; other blood @-@ body components can be present or may be partially removed . &quot;
the liquid content of the Con@@ duct consists of either the remaining plas@@ ma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ered solution that was placed after removal of plas@@ ma .
