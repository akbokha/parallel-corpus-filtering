this document is a summary of the European Public App@@ ear@@ ance report ( EP@@ AR ) in which is explained as the Committee for Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to get to recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the contents of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that are in the mouth dis@@ solve ) , as a solution to be taken ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and voc@@ ations , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing , or conc@@ eptions of things that are not present ) , mist@@ rust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods can be normal ) with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe bacteria episodes , and to the prevention of Man@@ ic episodes in patients who addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection @-@ resolution will be applied to rapid control of gest@@ ural un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders when the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be taken at night@@ ly or the mel@@ ting tablets in patients are used to make the swal@@ low of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines simultaneously , which are just as Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably appears especially as a &quot; partial aggression &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in common dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine can play a role in schizophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , wearing Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to normal@@ ise the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent re @-@ emergence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies about up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the injection solution has been carried out in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophr@@ enia or similar diseases that suffered from gest@@ ed un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in a further study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was killed over twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , compared to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ector solution was suffered from a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from gest@@ ed un@@ rest ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo for a period of two hours compared to a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients were based on the basis of a standard therapy for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who talked to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melt @-@ coated tablets and the solution to be taken .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution shown patients who received the Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than patients who received a placebo . &quot;
when applying to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies are more effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented also more effective up to 74 weeks as placebo for the re @-@ occurrence man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms dot@@ ted un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ id@@ ale interference ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , per@@ tin@@ ence ( so@@ aking ) , irrit@@ ation ( const@@ ip@@ ation ) , stimulation and exhaust@@ ion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ summer ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) and anxiety . &quot;
the committee for human resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schizophr@@ enia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episode in patients who were predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes in which the man@@ ic episodes associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
&quot; also , the committee also came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of gest@@ ural un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schizophr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes associated with bi@@ polar disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission shared the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the signing of Abi@@ li@@ fy across the European Union . &quot;
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of Bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a locking dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals .
an increased effectiveness at doses on a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schizophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients with 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initiation group should be considered , if clinical factors this just@@ ify it ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ du@@ ster is set out of combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ icide behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased addiction to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be applied with caution in patients with renowned cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ar@@ ine or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic disease , conditions which apply to hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( deh@@ ydr@@ ation , hyp@@ ovol@@ emia ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which was a year or less digest@@ ed , there was occa@@ sional reports during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol up@@ lift@@ ment Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; when in one with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient evol@@ ves signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or dis@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all Anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be set to be cancelled . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be in relation to patients with con@@ vul@@ sions in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in terms of conditions which are related to cr@@ abs in relation to be applied with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an elevated ster@@ ili@@ iko compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study involving the dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cerem@@ onial events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ acid@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients suffering from atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk ass@@ essm@@ ents for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events involving AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ her , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of gl@@ ucose values . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain will generally be observed in schizophr@@ enia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight gain as a side @-@ effect , and could lead to an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , be careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines such as se@@ per@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , with this effect as clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy subjects increased a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol around 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected to expect other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ oxet@@ ine and par@@ oxet@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be similar dosage reduction . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result in common use with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plas@@ ma concentration by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ si@@ ven met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits of potential risks to patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should have similar dosage reduction . &quot;
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the dosage should be raised from AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y to the dosage height from the beginning of the companion therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administ@@ ered together with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ mat@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol a day do not have significant effect on the metabol@@ ites of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should get out to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
&quot; due to the in@@ sufficient data base for security in humans and due to which in the reproductive studies , this drug should not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otrop@@ ic patients the patients should be warned that dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) from EPS including par@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term lon@@ gl@@ ed over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.5 % in patients suffering from placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53,@@ 3 % in patients suffering from semi @-@ sac@@ ri@@ dol treatment .
in a different study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lith@@ ium @-@ treatment .
during the long @-@ term phase of 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo , with which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratories appeared , no medic@@ ally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( creatine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ omatic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ treated patients compared to 2,0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects which can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and beyond their incidence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , unwanted events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia @-@ patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes Mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials and since the launch have been un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone in adult patients with valued doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
&quot; although there are no information on the effectiveness of a tick @-@ modi@@ fying with the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; it is unlikely that hem@@ orrho@@ sis is used in the treatment of an over@@ dose of utility , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high Plas@@ ma tube . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schizophr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in the combination of a particip@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine d@@ - and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or , as well as an extensive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 rep@@ in@@ duc@@ tors and for the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; on G@@ abe from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in doses from 0,5 to 30 mg once daily , the Pos@@ it@@ ons @-@ E@@ missions @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ sive reduction of the Bind@@ ing of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ recept@@ or lig@@ ently , on the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schizophr@@ en@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to placebo a statist@@ ically significant stronger improvement of mental symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was 52 the share of Respon@@ ding patients , who contributed a response to the study of research institutes , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ sc@@ ales that were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - de@@ press@@ ors scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophr@@ enia showed a significantly higher reduction of the rel@@ apse rate caused by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % under placebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational @-@ blind study involving schizophr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients re@@ com@@ pris@@ ed and in which the primary students rate has been reduced from at least 7 % compared to the starting point ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar disorder . Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an compared to placebo disease symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with patient dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed an over@@ due effectiveness .
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with an animal or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an compared to placebo , which was comparable to that of lith@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also pointed out a similar proportion of patients with sympt@@ omatic re@@ mission of Man@@ ie on how lith@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly reflect on lith@@ ium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy in the therapeutic treatment of therapeutic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lith@@ ium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during an stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol demonstrated a re@@ mission with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar failure , mainly in preventing a rel@@ apse in the Man@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro @-@ studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ging by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
the mean elim@@ ination of elim@@ ination time is nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol with exten@@ si@@ ven met@@ abolic disorders about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and roughly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ological investigation of schizophr@@ en@@ etic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ology has no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic adher@@ ence or the impact of smoking on Pharmac@@ ology of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ological characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; an individual dose study involving subjects with different radi@@ al liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of liver p@@ ine@@ z@@ ol and deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study involved only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for security vulner@@ ability , tox@@ icity at repeated G@@ abe , reproductive @-@ elast@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and become can@@ cer@@ ogenic potential for pre@@ clinical data left no particular dangers for man . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed with dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure at people , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects trans@@ fi@@ red a dos@@ er @-@ rin@@ der @-@ tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) at rats after 104 weeks at least 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ ary of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ x@@ asis has been found as a result of the fail@@ ures of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates from the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3@@ 1st of the medium Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81@@ cm of the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study which participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift and as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ axel drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; total spoke in the major study of 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; one sees only the patient who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , as time until the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival is not a difference between drugs . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , there were patients who had previously received other treatments for its metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that abrasion is more effective than conventional des@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be applied to patients who are breastfeeding , or before the start of the treatment of low new@@ com@@ ers in the blood . &quot;
the committee on human resources ( CH@@ MP ) determined that Abra@@ x@@ ane is not more effective in which the first treatment could not be more effective than conventional Pac@@ man pharmac@@ euticals could not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission divided the company Abra@@ x@@ is Bios@@ cience Limited a permit for the author@@ isation of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union . &quot;
abrasion @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indi@@ ces for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is fail@@ ing and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ ist therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ se ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ic &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the abrasion treatment should be reduced to about 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; with sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 is the treatment to under@@ break , up to degrees 1 or 2 , and with all following cycles , the dosage must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with easier to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies conducted with patients with affected kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to not adequate data for in@@ concei@@ vable and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ ic form@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ axel which could have essentially different pharmac@@ ological features as other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should immediately dis@@ integrate and be initiated a sympt@@ omatic treatment , and the patient may not be treated again with Pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in the patient there should be no re @-@ abrasion treatment cycles , until the Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has risen again to a height of 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with heavy liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abrasion .
&quot; while a clearly has been proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane related to cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , car@@ di@@ als are not un@@ common , especially in patients with former anth@@ racycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if in the patient after the gift of a string , v@@ om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting and diarr@@ hea , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ appetite and contra@@ sting funds . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or women of child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ axel is un@@ avoid@@ able . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable susp@@ ect method .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is stim@@ ulated , during and up to six months after the treatment of no child to witness . &quot;
male patients should be advised prior to treating a sperm flow since therapy with Abra@@ x@@ anes is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machines .
below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side @-@ effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast @-@ phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abrasion .
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most show@@ y important hem@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity ( with 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly re@@ versi@@ bly and dos@@ is@@ sions ; Leu@@ kop@@ enie has been reported in 71 % of patients .

&quot; rest@@ lessness 1 The incidence of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itivity reactions , based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients &quot;
&quot; since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and it was not a caus@@ al connection with these events . &quot;
Pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the mer@@ ging of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tubes and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules stabili@@ zed by inhibit@@ ing their Dep@@ oly@@ mp@@ ated .
&quot; these stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational Inter@@ phase and the exotic nucle@@ us functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ps has been convey@@ ed into the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plas@@ ma components and within the framework of in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies that promotes the presence of night@@ fall in the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ rez@@ ept@@ or and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous prot@@ eine SP@@ ARC ( trac@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in cyst@@ eine ) is a Pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of tum@@ ors .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two in@@ im@@ pover@@ ished un@@ blind@@ ed studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized phase III @-@ comparison study .
in a study 43 patients were treated with metastatic breast cancer with abrasion properties which was given in the form of inf@@ usion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 as inf@@ usion about 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ based Pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre @-@ medi@@ ation for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre @-@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; with the inclusion in the study 64 % of patients had a affected common condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ er@@ als . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of the patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % only a adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adjuv@@ ant treatment . &quot;

the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on Bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and continues to be unknown .
the pharmac@@ ology of the total @-@ Pac@@ man after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of abrasion with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the active ingredients ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .

the average volume of volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high level of distribution points to a far @-@ reaching out@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or turn@@ around from Pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving patients with advanced tum@@ ors the pharmac@@ ological characteristics of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 sol@@ vent with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ vent @-@ based Pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after a sol@@ vent @-@ based Pac@@ man injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue damage is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily associated to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .

&quot; the most common side effect of se@@ ab@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ aging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and per@@ plex@@ ity . &quot;
se@@ ab@@ amed may not be used in patients who may possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ is@@ al@@ fa or any of the ingredients .
&quot; se@@ ab@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;

in clinical studies there have been an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ese stimul@@ ating active ingredients ( ESA ) were given by over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have not shown any significant benefits that is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins , when the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ os@@ con@@ centric concentration on the control of the An@@ a@@ om@@ mpt@@ ome and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ usions required . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ pen accumulation should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 23@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ enter coron@@ ary heart disease or storage in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded by section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target groups .
&quot; after the time of these findings by the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency is not acceler@@ ated . &quot;

the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk factor under the participation of each patient that should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater elek@@ c@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the start of the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go to a greater interest in orthop@@ edic surgery , they should have an increased risk for thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of patients with a starting point of output &gt; 13 g / dl a increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies was not proven for epo@@ et@@ ine , that they can improve overall reduction in tum@@ or patients with sympt@@ omatic ana@@ emia . &quot;

&quot; ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa is applied together with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ an should be controlled and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ osis should be adapted to the rising hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ investigations in tum@@ ours there are no evidence of a interaction between epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF on hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with ep@@ eti@@ ine al@@ fa is a dos@@ y rise in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .

A@@ cl@@ asta is applied to treating the following illnesses : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high fr@@ ill @-@ risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hill . • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with boun@@ cing structure should get a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ections in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflammation ) just after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced in the three days following the inf@@ usion of disease , such as fever , muscle sor@@ eness , gri@@ ps and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it has been investigated the number of spinal fluid and ac@@ etab@@ ulum over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study conducted 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip par@@ ishes ; it has been investigated the number of fr@@ ac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta has been tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
the main course of the effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ine of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone sub@@ stan@@ z ) in the blood back normal@@ ized or at least 75 % compared to the starting point .
in the study with older women the risk of spinal fluid in patients with A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to patients under placebo for 70 % reduced .
compared to all patients with A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cine ) with those under placebo , the risk of ac@@ etab@@ ulum was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with ac@@ etab@@ ulum having 9 % of patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ asta ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients suffering from placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occurs within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repet@@ itive inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may possibly trans@@ itive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ or or any of the ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to patients with A@@ cl@@ asta of the risk of kidney , reactions at the inf@@ usion of inf@@ usion and oste@@ opathy ( with@@ ering of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta presents clear@@ ing material for doctors ready to apply the A@@ cl@@ asta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and noted when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

for the treatment of mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta has been observed a long re@@ use period in patients who addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to make sufficient amounts of calcium , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg ru@@ ar@@ ed calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently , low @-@ trau@@ matic hip , an initiation dose is recommended from 5@@ 0,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;

&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 because data are missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as for this patient population only are limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is at the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta due to adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of the rapid deployment of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary , mit@@ unter sympt@@ omatic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to make sufficient amounts of calcium , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg ru@@ ar@@ ed calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; for patients who require D@@ ent@@ al@@ ein@@ gri@@ ps , there are no data available whether the break of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates is reduced the risk of oste@@ opathy in the j@@ aw area . &quot;
the clinical review by the treatment doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of any patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .

kidney disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions resulting from ren@@ al ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in Ser@@ um @-@ Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in some rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the creation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( annually judged before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years compared to oste@@ opor@@ osis and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after G@@ abe was observed with 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ omatic calcium values , which were under 2,3 % of treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus p@@ ago@@ et studies . &quot;
all patients received an adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to prevent clinical fr@@ ac@@ tures according to a hat@@ ch@@ ate structure and in the mor@@ bus p@@ ago@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study to prevent clinical fr@@ ac@@ tures , after a recent ex@@ pi@@ ed hip , the vitamin D @-@ mirror were not measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown with a bone structure ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone structure for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing cycl@@ ist structure .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ ric verteb@@ ra@@ fts A@@ cl@@ asta lowers significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the incidence of one or more new spinal fluid ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients aged 75 years and older had a reduction of 60 % reduced risk for spinal fluid cells compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
&quot; effects on hip re@@ fr@@ ac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta pointed a equal effect over three years , which results in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for re@@ fr@@ ac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip , and at the dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment significant to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase in the bone density of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ral column around 6,@@ 7 % , the entire thig@@ h around 6.0 % , the narrow radius at 5.4 % , and the dist@@ al radius at 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) a year after the third annual dose of bone bone .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed up with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to placebo a increase of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone structure and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ ker the bones @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ( B@@ 1@@ NP ) in Ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ C@@ T@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 517 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odi@@ cal inter@@ v@@ als during the study .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the starting point and was held at 28 % below the starting value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the starting value to 36 months .
B @-@ C@@ T@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the starting value to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D @-@ mirror were not measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received a initial vitamin D ( 5@@ 0,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
the overall mort@@ ality was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the with A@@ cl@@ asta treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral @-@ density ( BM@@ D ) In the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total and scrap@@ ers to all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment performed over 24 months compared to the placebo treatment for an increase in the BM@@ D around 5.7 % at the total and around 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical effectiveness in men In the HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were reported 5@@ 08 men random@@ ised and with 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fr@@ ac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical fr@@ ac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.9 % in placebo .

11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once every day during 2 months was proven in two six@@ ths studies .
with the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain @-@ strength and pain @-@ influenced compared to the starting point for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients that were classified at the end of the six@@ teenth major study as Respon@@ sibility ( based on therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .

&quot; unique and multi@@ ples 5 and 15 mins lasted inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients made the following pharmac@@ ological data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ous rapidly took off at &lt; 10 % of the peak after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;

&quot; the early stages phases ( α and ß , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) represent the quick res@@ or@@ ption of the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the rich@@ ly dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ re@@ - concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centric ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme met@@ abolic substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ lized or not a direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patients ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was examined at 64 ± 29 ml / min ( area 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
resulting in fact that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive ren@@ al disorder up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
there are only restricted data for serious ren@@ al disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) are only restricted to these populations .

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ class @-@ class , called the bis@@ phosph@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the fem@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; decre@@ asing blood levels of gender hormones , above all o@@ est@@ rogen , which are formed from andro@@ gens , play a role in rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , the bone structure takes place too quickly , and new bone material is un@@ arranged according to the bone material we@@ aker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta seems to normal@@ izes the bone structure , thereby creating a normal bone formation and thus gives the bone again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or under@@ go to a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines please inform your doctor , chem@@ ist or nursing staff , if you have used other medicines / apply or recently used , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine from which it is known to the kidneys . &quot;
when applying A@@ cl@@ asta along with food and drinks you are worried that you have enough fluid in accordance with the instructions of your doctor and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .

&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , is recommended to advance the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hill . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et The usual dose is 5 mg that will provide you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion .
&quot; as A@@ cl@@ asta acts for a long time , you may need to require another dose of only after one year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium mirror in your blood in time after inf@@ usion are not too low . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ asta can last longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta fits , you will get in touch with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta if you are considering the completion of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta considering , please take your next physician to your doctor and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
side effects related to the first inf@@ usion are very common ( for more than 30 % of the patients ) are after subsequent inf@@ usions but less common .

&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin , the current dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants and ins@@ ulin can be kept at the beginning of the ac@@ tos as well as in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ ates or ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be better toler@@ ated and decre@@ ases the blood sugar level , thereby reducing type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the patients received a combination of acet@@ ylene in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ amide fabric , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ mopolit@@ an hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which is dis@@ assembled as well as the blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which suggests that the blood sugar values are reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ dy@@ e in a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values in a reduction of placebo for a reduction of 0.35 % led .
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin were examined for 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who participated in addition to ins@@ ulin , a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 1.9 % after 6 months , compared with 0,@@ 14 % in patients who were additionally placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to ac@@ tos were tend@@ ons , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight increases and hy@@ po@@ ana@@ esth@@ esi@@ ology ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to friction ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos must not be used either in patients who may respond excessive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other ingredients , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ acid@@ osis ( high ket@@ on@@ als - acid@@ sp@@ ar ) - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos as part of a mon@@ otherapy ( during the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients should not be shown in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission divided the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the signing of accounts in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also displayed for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with ins@@ ulin in@@ sufficient and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on for patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier , heart attack or sympt@@ omatic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight increases or o@@ des@@ men , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight increases and oils , if Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study involving pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients suffering from 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disorder has been carried out .
in this study showed an increase in reports about heart failure . however , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased extr@@ acting liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard zone ) , or with other signs of liver disease may not be used in Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror up to 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the standard zone are increased , the liver disease values are as soon as possible again . &quot;
&quot; if there is a patient symptoms that point on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , v@@ om@@ iting , th@@ el@@ essness and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver disease values to check . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient continues with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be initiated by the clinical terms of clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on a dos@@ per @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected and connected in some cases with a liquid .
as a result of a her@@ e@@ el@@ ution stood by the therapy with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on a low reduction of the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ id levels ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ re ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ in um 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower extent in patients suffering from sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ase and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a consequence of increased ins@@ ulin itivity , in patients , the Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one can be used as oral branches or triple therapy with ins@@ ulin gene therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ di@@ cts hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about a appearance or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ed with a dimin@@ ution of the vision@@ aries . &quot;
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men to be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma . a suitable ophthal@@ mic review should be considered .
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events with regard to bone break@@ age from random@@ ized , controlled , dou@@ bl@@ in@@ tra @-@ clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the calculated fre@@ eze @-@ incidence was 1,@@ 9 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with the pioneer women and 1,1 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with women who were treated with a comparison . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , fr@@ ac@@ tures on 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) who were treated with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fr@@ ac@@ tures per 100 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the patient should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or if it occurs , the treatment is degra@@ ded ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ogen@@ etics or pharmac@@ ology of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ id@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines used by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ al contrac@@ eptive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) results in an increase in the AU@@ C by Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ du@@ k ) results in a reduction of AU@@ C by Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under the treatment of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ishes hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant to the wom@@ ens and thereby reduce the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fat growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not ass@@ essed ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the turbin@@ es and the inde@@ er inde@@ er of lens as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic ingredients .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents occurred on the triple of the upper limit of the standard range , but rarely as in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disorder was the frequency of a severe heart failure in Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on to 1.6 % higher than under placebo if Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the launch has been rarely reported about heart failure in Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but it is more common in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; there was a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events related to bone break@@ age from random@@ ized , controlled , dou@@ bl@@ in@@ tra @-@ clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative cancer treatment . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years current pro@@ active study , fr@@ ac@@ tures entered at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) which were treated with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison of comparison . &quot;
&quot; at taking the peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days came no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to effect over a activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator , Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ) , which leads to the animal @-@ model to an increased ins@@ ens@@ itivity of liver , li@@ pos@@ - and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on is reduced to Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and the periph@@ eral gl@@ ucose recovery in the case of ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant increases .
a clinical study with Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ de azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the period until leaving the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the therapy the therapy was able to maintain a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients suffering from Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was adjusted despite three @-@ imp@@ aired optim@@ isation phase with ins@@ ulin in@@ sufficient , to Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Plac@@ ebo random@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the mean h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value around 0,45 % , compared to the patients who continued to provide ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the treatment of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on @-@ treated group has been observed . &quot;
in clinical studies about a year showed themselves under Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on consistently a statist@@ ically significant decline in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ ten compared to the starting point .
the effect of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , based investigation of type @-@ 2 conduc@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly raised L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d the total plas@@ matri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , it was not a statist@@ ically significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks of reduced Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the n@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide levels , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ous levels , both on a effect on the tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ies absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ous synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a car@@ dio Vas@@ cular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups random@@ ised , which received a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti @-@ diab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; after or@@ aler , Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ized , with the top @-@ concentration of un@@ changeable Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plas@@ ma usually 2 hours of application will be achieved . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis corresponds to the effectiveness of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action studies , it could be proven that Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ogen@@ etics or pharmac@@ ology of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ du@@ k ) or lowers the plas@@ ma concentration of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after an active application of radio@@ active mark@@ eted pioneer in humans , the Mar@@ ker was mainly found in the threads ( 55 % ) and a lower dimension in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the average plas@@ ma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ age of un@@ changeable Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active metabol@@ ites lies at 16 - 23 hours .
the plas@@ ma @-@ concentration of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function lower than in healthy volunteers .
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ology studies occurred on mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ding according to repet@@ itive adoption of plas@@ ma volume , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that among the treatment of Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ishes hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant to the wom@@ ens and thereby reduce the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fat growth .

in a further study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d examined .
in clinical studies about 1 year at Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statist@@ ically significant decline in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ ten compared to the starting point .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks of reduced Pi@@ ogl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the n@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide levels , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ous levels , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ ing synthesis . &quot;

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mir@@ rors that emphas@@ ised that the blood sugar levels are similar to a different human@@ ic ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used for patients who may possibly re@@ tender ( allergic ) to Human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses will need to be adapted to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane when it is possible to work together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found on the contents . ) &quot;
the committee for human resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane increases in treating diabetes to risk .

&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in patients a dose is required , this may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions arose after a change of animal on human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early War@@ n@@ avi@@ es of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia was less pronounced or other than in its previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; travelling who go over several times , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals have to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may have to be adapted if it is possible to work together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission divided the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for approval of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union .
&quot; when two types of ins@@ ulin be mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting ins@@ ulin must be raised , then the amount of long acting ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 . if changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient may need a dosage adjustment , this may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; travelling who go over several times , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals have to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total length is about 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and young people The pharmac@@ ological profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was investigated on a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ esc@@ ents ( ages 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data is limited , but the assumption that the pharmac@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adol@@ esc@@ ents are similar to adults . &quot;

in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
&quot; main course of the effectiveness was the number of patients , their ur@@ inary tract in the blood for the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patient , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once attended 120 mg at the last three measurements in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
compared to this this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of the 134 patients under placebo .
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
especially in patients with heart difficulties in the pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .

for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C is observed that is greater than the dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate increase .
after intake simple or multi@@ pl@@ ine doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max about 2.8 @-@ 3 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid re@@ medi@@ ation , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and ur@@ ination and for clinical application as not relevant .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in or@@ al doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day do not have an effect on the fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are bre@@ aming ) in women after men@@ opause , in which a risk consists of a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before food , drink , or night@@ ly other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vit@@ amin@@ ating supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid an irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the ear@@ liest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and the published literature . &quot;
&quot; the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , to reflect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mir@@ rors . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients had been treated with low vitamin D in patients with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also put data in front of which the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose is exactly the dosage that is needed for the prevention of a bone loss .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ i@@ asis like abdom@@ inal pain ) , const@@ ip@@ ation ( ul@@ cers ) , ul@@ tra@@ p ( ul@@ cers ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ ous abdom@@ en ) , ul@@ cer@@ ous abdom@@ en ( bu@@ ck@@ le ) and su@@ res . &quot;
patients with mental hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , Vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients may not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low cal@@ ci@@ ph@@ emia ) or in patients who can not stand up at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission defe@@ ated the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the inclusion of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shape , white up broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on the one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or adjustment of pharmac@@ euticals ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vit@@ amin@@ ating supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following hin@@ ts are precisely to follow in order to decrease the risk of es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed for the tablet of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the ear@@ liest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. p@@ ept@@ al ul@@ cus , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , can be given only in particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ es@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sions , were rarely followed by es@@ oph@@ age@@ al stri@@ c@@ tures , were reported in patients suffering from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required a rotation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore indicate attention to any signs and symptoms that should point out to any signs and symptoms that should be advised on possible es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain when swal@@ low or retro@@ spective sor@@ eness or re @-@ burn the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be raised in patients suffering the medicine correctly and / or , after the appearance of symptoms that point to a es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all doses will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was established , rarely ( after launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis rose by the pine , usually associated with a dentistry and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported by cancer patients whose therap@@ ist com@@ ime with intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ months . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to give advice , whether the retri@@ ev@@ ing of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy for patients who dimin@@ ishes a ki@@ j@@ aw surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treatment doctor is relevant for the treatment plan in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be dependent on taking a dose of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned for the designated week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases that affect the minerals ( like vitamin @-@ D lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm@@ us ) should be treated before the treatment of treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium @-@ supplements , ant@@ acids , and some or@@ al drugs may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients must wait after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific inter@@ activity studies were not conducted , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies have been taken together with a variety of usually prescribed drugs without a clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended to apply for the use of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable to women during pregnancy .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly dam@@ aging effects in terms of pregnancy that can realize embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and fr@@ act@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the cargo structure ( FIT : n = 6.@@ 459 ) .
in the phase III studies the middle ages of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day in proportion to placebo after 3 years 8.8 % at the spine to 5.@@ 9 % at the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ al and 7.8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spinal column and mer@@ chandi@@ sers continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
fit consi@@ sted of two pl@@ az@@ ed controlled studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg twice daily over 2 years and afterwards 10 mg once more than 1 or 2 years ) was taken :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at the appearance of at least a new spinal cord increases by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.1 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption to a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average loss of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in women to pay for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night@@ ly fasting and two hours before recording of a stand@@ ar@@ ed breakfast .
the bio@@ availability participated in accordance with around 6.3 % and 0.39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at has taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed breakfast .

&quot; 9 distribution studies have occurred to rats , that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily distributed to intraven@@ ous G@@ abe from 1 mg / kg temporarily in Wei@@ cht@@ eil@@ ing , but then swi@@ ft@@ ly distributed in the bones or with the urine . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with intraven@@ ous G@@ abe , a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at about 50 % of radio@@ active marked substance within 72 hours with the urine break and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the strings . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous , a single dose of 10 mg was the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic clear@@ ance is not 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not taken over the sour or bas@@ al transportation system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not accepted that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; although there is no clinical data about it , nevertheless , the ren@@ al Eli@@ mination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the animal are also trying in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is given adult patients administ@@ ered to prevent a kidney or liver transp@@ lan@@ ts , to prevent a rep@@ ulsion of the tran@@ spl@@ ant organs to prevent the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been deploy@@ ed in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously carried out studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney splant@@ ation whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f has been compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; primary indic@@ t@@ ator of the effectiveness was the number of patients , in which the tran@@ splant@@ ation was rep@@ elled after treatment of a year ( by example , how often a ren@@ dered organs tran@@ spl@@ ant or a resu@@ mption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more recent studies have been carried out at 119 patients with kidney gra@@ fting and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant and studied , such as Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft by the body . &quot;

&quot; only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients , this drug should arrange or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to tran@@ splant@@ at@@ oplast@@ y or an increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immune @-@ supp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; switching of the form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of one in the tran@@ splant@@ ation of experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a conversion to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment is to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and intoler@@ ance in the individual case and on blood levels ( see below ) recommendations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks to conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a talent , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and in the tran@@ spl@@ ant patients . &quot;
careful and repet@@ itive controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ talents are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splant@@ ation under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of patients in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow drugs to intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate for the production of an inf@@ usion resolution ) , with a dose of approx . &quot;
the duration of the application The oppression of tran@@ spl@@ ant must be maintained that immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ p must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney oxid@@ ation proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is the Tran@@ splant@@ at@@ ab@@ sto@@ cking The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment may be required later because the pharmac@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after tran@@ splant@@ ation .
dosage recommendations - liver tran@@ splant@@ ation proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is the Tran@@ splant@@ at@@ ab@@ sto@@ cking The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be a tran@@ spl@@ ant of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , according to the entire day @-@ dose . &quot;
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant After a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ si@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once daily has to start treatment with the implant and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant or@@ atory initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is .
heart tran@@ spl@@ ant In adult patients that are re@@ acted on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is an oral initiation of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once daily to take in the morning .
&quot; other tran@@ spl@@ ant if there is no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pan@@ an@@ as@@ - and dar@@ mer@@ ged patients in a or@@ al initi@@ alization of 0.2 mg / kg / day , in a or@@ al initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day and for application . &quot;
dosage customiz@@ ations in special patient groups with reduced liver function for maintenance of bleeding mirror in the desired area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dosage .
patients with reduced kidney function because the ren@@ al function has no effect on the pharmac@@ ogen@@ etics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may assume that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical potenti@@ als of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , is a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um levels ) , a calculation of the creat@@ in@@ incl@@ ance and monitoring of ur@@ inary tract ) . &quot;
switch from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f At the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the fe@@ asts of the full @-@ fl@@ ut The dosage should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and compatibility in the case of coinci@@ dental tac@@ tic tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ in@@ ism checks .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ talent while the first two weeks of tran@@ splant@@ ation followed by peri@@ odi@@ cal controls during pregnancy therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ talent of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled according to Pro@@ gra@@ f at ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous application of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ full blood concentration . ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State is entered . &quot;
the data in clinical studies allow that successful treatment in most cases is possible when the talents in the blood 20 ng / ml can not exceed .
in clinical practice the fe@@ eds of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver tran@@ splant@@ ations usually occurs in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with pu@@ ff@@ ed patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent investigation of liver , kidney , and cardi@@ ac tran@@ spl@@ ant were usually used blood @-@ concentration in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; it has led to serious unwanted events , including tran@@ splant@@ at@@ ab@@ sto@@ l or other side @-@ effects , which can occur in a consequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or over@@ ex@@ position . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; switching of the form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of one in the tran@@ splant@@ ation of experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant rep@@ ulsion , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed phrase Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is the tran@@ splant@@ at@@ y@@ rep@@ ulsion at adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant , and tran@@ spl@@ ant recei@@ vers in inf@@ ancy , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ es in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) is to avoid the cur@@ rants during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , an especially careful monitoring of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood offered because the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in some cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f , a as Cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was recorded in Kammer@@ s- or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; further factors , which increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infection , hydr@@ ation over@@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of risk of risks through appropriate clothing or use of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who use tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for P@@ RES like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and tend@@ ons should show a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ bl@@ ae , ret@@ ardi@@ s , L@@ act@@ osis , is provided in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary Gal@@ act@@ osis , L@@ act@@ ase @-@ lack or gl@@ ucose @-@ g@@ act@@ osis mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as hem@@ mer or indu@@ ction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can increase or decrease the blood @-@ values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or decrease the blood @-@ values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
it is therefore advised to modify the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels at the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A dosage for maintaining simultaneous concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
&quot; a highly pronounced interaction was generated with anti @-@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ id antibiotic er@@ y@@ thromycin and HIV @-@ prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ological studies , that the rise in blood levels is mainly due to the increased original bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal altern@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ volume Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as is used in acute abdom@@ inal actions , the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be known as a CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ lized by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abolic disorders .
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid tra@@ z@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a down and thus can increase hormonal ex@@ position , is especially careful with decisions regarding rec@@ eptive measures . &quot;
the results of animal attempts have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half @-@ period .
the results of a small number of studies on tran@@ spl@@ ant patients provide no indication that among tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants is an increased risk for unwanted events in terms of the course and the outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in the uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended to change harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
there is the risk of re@@ birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ c@@ ali@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ born ) i.e. :
the imp@@ acting profile of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often be found because of the under@@ tak@@ er of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below are the side effects after their incidence in desc@@ ending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( incidence on the basis of available data not in@@ valuable ) . &quot;

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its small water @-@ soluble and the high bond of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plas@@ map@@ rot@@ eine can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ tic . &quot;

Adv@@ antage is used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with Hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII conditional , inn@@ ate blood treatment ) . &quot;
dosage and frequency of the application are directed to whether Adv@@ antage can be applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding when surgical procedures .
patients with Hem@@ ophi@@ lia A is suffering from a factor VIII def@@ ect which causes blood flow problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ antage is similar in the European Union approved drugs called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it will be different , however , so that the medicine does not contain proteins human@@ istic or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients suffering from severe to medium @-@ severe H@@ ash@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main stage , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new bleeding sep@@ ia with &quot; excellent &quot; respectively &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; respectively &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ antage ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , Py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ antage may not be used for patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human straight@@ forward ac@@ tor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ ries or any of the ingredients . &quot;
&quot; March 2004 , the European Commission divided the Company B@@ ax@@ ter AG to provide approval for the transport of Adv@@ antage in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the tri@@ cycle of factor VIII , according to the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of the patient . &quot;
in the following her@@ ber@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity is not meant to drop the given plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ res ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the p@@ ains and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger to the patients is over .
&quot; during the treatment course , controlling the inj@@ ections and the incidence of inj@@ ections is an adequate determination of factor VIII @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ res . &quot;
individual patients can vary in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is to be given in patients with severe ash@@ ed@@ ophi@@ lia A : doses between 20 and 40 can be of factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plas@@ ma activities will not be achieved or if the bleeding with a reasonable dosage is not ruled , a test must be performed in order to im@@ pose a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions have to be inv@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; the adoption of the patient should be directed according to the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutral antibodies against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in treating patients with Hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII and Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plas@@ ma via modi@@ fiable Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position at the biggest is and dependent on genetic and other factors . &quot;

due to the rare occurrence of the Hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women are beyond the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lact@@ ation .
&quot; in the greatest number of patients re@@ lie@@ ve A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which all have previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the subject of delivery available data , the CH@@ MP has the benefit @-@ risk ex@@ termination continues to be considered positi@@ vely , but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is required on the basis of the security process of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes an fil@@ ing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the allowance for 5 years has to request a further extension procedure for 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company adop@@ ts its application on approval for the transport of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; usually , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the cros@@ sover ( tissues that links other structures in the body and is based on it ) . &quot;
this is a type of virus that gene@@ tically modified as it has been a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; in the virus in Adv@@ antage , it is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been changed so that there can no copies of itself and cannot cause infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ antage could have spra@@ yed directly into the tum@@ ors and to allow the cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein once again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is derived from the not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and the killing of cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not right , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study involving a patient with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ tree , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; once the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company to the questions asked , were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP created a day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not adequ@@ ately proven that the injection of Adv@@ antage in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors will take advantage of the patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not adequ@@ ately proven that Adv@@ ry can be established in reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company put not aware of the CH@@ MP if the rel@@ ying consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ sting Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ antage .
&quot; altered active ingredient &quot; means that the tablets are so coll@@ ap@@ sed , that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly is released over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ aze is applied to the treatment of the symptoms of the seas@@ onal rhin@@ itis ( ha@@ yst@@ ro@@ ps caused by an allergy to Pol@@ len inflammation of the nose @-@ passages ) in patients with nas@@ al passages .
&quot; in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ aze is twice daily to be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al passages ( pet@@ ri@@ pped nose ) . &quot;
&quot; a treatment period of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be correct@@ ed on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
the main @-@ effective dimensions were the changes of gravity of the hypo@@ cris@@ p @-@ pl@@ omas which were reported by patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all the ha@@ yst@@ u@@ pf@@ ens@@ y@@ mpt@@ ome , except the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose , patients reported on a decrease of symptoms around 4@@ 0 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in the patient , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al passages has been considered , the patients suffering from the symptoms of the symptoms around 3@@ 7.1 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patient , the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of a@@ in@@ se ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ant@@ y@@ car@@ es ( cardi@@ ac itis ) , harmon@@ ic , mental hyper@@ activity ( ins@@ om@@ itis ) , const@@ ip@@ ation , head@@ aches , fatigue , in@@ summer ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ el@@ essness ) , ins@@ om@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may be used for patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against rep@@ in@@ ep@@ rep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; spray ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension caused ) had or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ um stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission divided the company SP Europe , a permit for the transport of a@@ at@@ se throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is not to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush , break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used for the failure of data for in@@ concei@@ vable and effic@@ acy ( see section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after closing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration on 10 days as long as long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in with time can decrease .
&quot; after decrease the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breath@@ s , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , the medicine is also contra@@ sting in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attributed to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ in , Per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Er@@ got@@ hic , Er@@ got@@ hic , Er@@ got@@ hic or nas@@ al , eph@@ edr@@ ine , eph@@ ants , O@@ xy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ ard etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and the effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient , and the data is not sufficient to speak corresponding recommendations to the dosage . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of a@@ at@@ se were not checked in patients with kidney or liver disorder , and the data is not sufficient to speak corresponding recommendations to the dosage . &quot;
patients must be informed about that treatment in appearance of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ es or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( like head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be reduced . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the following patient groups will be caution : • patients suffering from digital@@ is • patients with hyper@@ tension and patients with hyper@@ tension , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asm in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before performing dermat@@ ological testing since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin actions or to reduce their extent .
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in addition to those y@@ thromycin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , in addition , have been no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plas@@ ma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; with the results of the psychological testing , no significant differences between the patients were treated with disaster @-@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; this is not yet identified for the metabol@@ ites of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , the enzyme has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines could not be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hibit in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one . &quot;
the in@@ concei@@ vable application of the treatment of aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not assured of experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however no increase in frequency of ab@@ normalities compared to the frequency by the normal population .
there is no reproductive studies on animals not always transmitted to man and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ cal properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in should not be used in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be aware of that in very rare cases it can come to a nam@@ e@@ tion that may lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ validation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ ap@@ ses ) and a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ als . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially likely , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , P@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigi@@ d and - Dil@@ at@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of pro@@ visional cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the adhes@@ ion sm@@ ol@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ ins on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells . &quot;
in a single @-@ dose study involving adults Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg every day do not have increased incidence of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in in the recommended Dos@@ age may cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ es or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S @-@ arousal . &quot;
&quot; 248 patients participated in the ages of 12 to 78 years with seas@@ onal rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of a@@ in@@ aze tablets , determines significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of a@@ at@@ se tablets with regard to the ab@@ ell@@ ant effect , determined by the nas@@ al glands , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of a@@ in@@ aze tablets showed in terms of gender , age or eth@@ nic@@ er belonging to patients no significant differences . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness was measured by the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the square , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance at the day ) before and after six@@ ty &apos;s treatment . &quot;
&quot; other studies were submitted to show that the body accum@@ ulated the sy@@ rup , the solution to be taken and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same manner reveals such as the tablets and the application in children are harmless . &quot;
&quot; caused by allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were examined , the two weekly treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average extraction of symptoms ( symptoms ) to 25 to 32 % compared to the patient who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decline of the symptoms with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared with placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be overweight ( allergic ) against dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission shared the Company SP Europe , a permit for the signing of A@@ eri@@ us to the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for all@@ evi@@ ating the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mit@@ ment and persistent rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience of clinical trials for effectiveness when using Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mit@@ ment allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current disease progression and can be termin@@ ated after the end of the symptoms and during their re @-@ occurrence .
in the per@@ sist@@ ing allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to the patient during allergy time a lasting treatment .
clinical relevant interactions were not shown as part of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets were not found in which y@@ thromycin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study was not enhanced in simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the efficient effect of alcohol ( see under section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be aware of that it may occur in very rare cases that may lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently used side effects , reported on the more frequently than placebo , were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 juven@@ ile patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect of head@@ aches , which were treated with 5,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ phase study , where up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( n@@ in@@ ety clinical dose ) have been given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the pro@@ visional cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the adhes@@ ion sm@@ ol@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ ins on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; within a clinical trial with multiple users , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage given up to 20 mg every day has been given over 14 days , was not statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant Car@@ di@@ ovas@@ cul@@ cular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was given over ten days a day was not an extension of the Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in a single case , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected with the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in all@@ evi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , t@@ ear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of symptoms can also be divided into inter@@ mit@@ able allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mit@@ igation allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent rhin@@ itis is defined as appearance of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the total effect of the questionn@@ aires of the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decl@@ ares the rhin@@ itis rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; chronic Idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria has been dep@@ uty for more forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ physi@@ ology , regardless of the ae@@ ti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; as the hist@@ amine s@@ ay@@ ment is an urs@@ ory factor in all urban conditions , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in besides the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria is also found in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; like in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines at chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of the patients who were not re@@ acted to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines . &quot;
an improvement of the itch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with disaster patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the dis@@ ruption of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ology study , in which patients were comparable with the general seas@@ onal rhin@@ itis populations , was reached at 4 % of patients a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no locking points for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , this has not been identified for the metabol@@ ites of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ responsible Enz@@ ym , however , has not been identified , so interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect flu which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which could result in front of a strain of flu , which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new tribe of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus occurs , which can easily spread from man to man because people have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immune system will be able to form quickly antibodies in a contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this tribe . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface @-@ anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ alien ) , and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thereby the scope of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other antiv@@ ir@@ al medicines to treat adults and children over four years , associated with human immun@@ ode@@ ev@@ irus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ ode@@ fic@@ iency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules can be taken as a solution to night@@ ly , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , because the safety of this combination is not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked , what antiv@@ ir@@ al medicines of the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that the virus will appeal to the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily along with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other antiv@@ ir@@ al drugs .
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of apple depends on the body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces HIV @-@ quantity in combination with other antiv@@ ir@@ al medicines that keeps the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; Aids does not cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system can also result in the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was used in combination with other antiv@@ ir@@ al drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , who previously had not been treated with prot@@ ease . &quot;
&quot; that with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was taken at 206 adults , which had previously taken before prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ mer , with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
main indi@@ rect for effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ rep@@ utable concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ mer , after 48 weeks below A@@ gener@@ ase had more patients a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with children dimin@@ ished A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the Vir@@ us@@ load , however , by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
in the study with adults who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier that with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r strengthened medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other Prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ mer :
&quot; in patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after four weeks than in patients who continue their previous prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ ance : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients who may be overweight ( allergic ) against am@@ mun@@ avi@@ r , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a must also not be used in patients to use cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are just as poll@@ u@@ ase and in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health are harmful .
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV consists of patients , the A@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body @-@ fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( de@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ otherap@@ ist syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection which are caused by the immune system immune system ) . &quot;
the committee for human resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years against the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ological amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons , only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission divided the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited , the approval of A@@ gener@@ a in the whole European Union . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ mer ( PI ) . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be administ@@ ered to the pharmac@@ ological booster packs of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral effect and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r as a solution to capture is 14 % lower than by Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to be taken on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ n@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be applied without the ampli@@ fying additi@@ ve of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booklet ) must be applied to higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ dou@@ gh@@ r / kg of body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ dou@@ gh@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ology , effectiveness and safety of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease @-@ per@@ ation were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for applying for children under 4 years , due to the failure of data for in@@ concei@@ vable and effic@@ acy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ological data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
simultaneous application is intended to be done in patients with easy or moderate liver treatment with caution when patients with severe liver disease is it contra@@ dic@@ tory ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals which represent a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements which contain cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ mun@@ avi@@ r during the ing@@ est@@ ion of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and may be treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous antiv@@ ir@@ al treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C please read the relevant information on this medicine .
&quot; patients with existing limited liver function , including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis , demonstrate an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ oc@@ as@@ or other gl@@ ucose concentr@@ ates , which is not recommended to CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , unless it weighs the potential benefits of treatment of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ idal effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ kt@@ ase inhibit@@ ors and sim@@ vast@@ atin be strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ mp@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standardi@@ zation ) , are available methods for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of decreased plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ds of Am@@ ir@@ ca@@ v ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r can be altered the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ eptive contra@@ di@@ tiv@@ a , however the information is not sufficient to be able to appreciate the nature of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ rop@@ es symptom , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ on the A@@ Gener@@ ase solution to be taken by children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders , associated . &quot;
&quot; with h@@ ub@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ izing reports , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous k@@ ut@@ ans Hä@@ mat@@ ome and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ izing patients can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ omatic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial A@@ ti@@ ology is approved ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune @-@ supp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals which represent a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with pharmac@@ euticals whose ingredients are mainly associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ res with weight@@ y and / or life @-@ threatening effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vibr@@ ational failure and lead to a level of resistance .
&quot; in trying to follow the reduced plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ res by a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often undes@@ ired effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ ians ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ vi@@ als of Am@@ ir@@ ca@@ i can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already involved in cur@@ rants , the am@@ ylo@@ id mirror and if possible , to review the Vir@@ us@@ last and to implement the cur@@ rants . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ ir@@ ca@@ vi@@ r ( see also E@@ fav@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ dou@@ gh@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies the doses of 600 mg of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily which demonstrate the effectiveness and in@@ concei@@ vable of this treatment protocol .
52 % less ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min &apos;s values of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r in plas@@ ma , which were reached in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage for simultaneous adoption of Am@@ ir@@ ca@@ i and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ concei@@ vable of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ological study for applying A@@ gener@@ a in combination with th@@ under@@ os@@ in , but is advised due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ asis will be apart at least one hour ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in addition to the gift of E@@ zi@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required . &quot;
the treatment with emit@@ ters in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ mer would be low .
the effect of Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ in to other Prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ mer and existing limited data can be susp@@ ect that Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r possibly lowers .
&quot; if this drug should be used at the same time , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ res . &quot;
&quot; when these drugs are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
simultaneous addition of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in plas@@ mas@@ on@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in around 193 % and thus a rise in ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in connected side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
Phar@@ mo@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ a combined with er@@ y@@ thromycin were not conducted but could be the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ous of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plas@@ ma at 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ law ) to the value of 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines to be listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or In@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ a , potentially lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions which are connected to these drugs when they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other Prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ mer , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , which are known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ b@@ olog@@ ne@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ds of Am@@ dou@@ gh@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um @-@ concentr@@ ations of calcium can@@ al@@ ines like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , nic@@ di@@ pin , nic@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pine , N@@ ins@@ di@@
&quot; simultaneous ing@@ est@@ ion with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase considerably , and enhance PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection related effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , tend@@ ons and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) during the end@@ ogen@@ ous Kort@@ is@@ ol ( 90 % bonus interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase will not be advised with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these gl@@ ucose ok@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treating the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , the altern@@ ating altern@@ ation of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is strongly dependent on the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ res in simultaneous adoption of A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; since plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ red increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ se , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended by am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the plas@@ ma @-@ concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased at the simultaneous gift of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while on the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ ic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ ic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors to a possible increase in plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ res from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ rop@@ es symptom , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the per se low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the Am@@ olog@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is to be able to adjust if Am@@ nest@@ ing is at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous addition of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , together with A@@ gener@@ a , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ) is recommended for the possibility of a atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ co@@ er@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not predic@@ table , so alternative methods are recommended for conception . &quot;
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended in simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; this drug may only be applied during pregnancy , only after careful dis@@ appearance of possible utility for the mother as opposed to possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in the milk l@@ active rats were proved to be am@@ big@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known as Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r at humans into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a re@@ production study of pregnant rats has been administ@@ ered by the income in the uter@@ us to the end of the st@@ agn@@ ant Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r during the down@@ time a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the seed .
the further development of descendants including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r to the mother .
the infin@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ a was examined in adults and with children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
&quot; most associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment associated effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early on and rarely led to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; for many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the atro@@ city . &quot;
&quot; most of the parts listed below are of two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors do not have treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were deploy@@ ed by the examination as in connection with the study @-@ media , and with more than 1 % of the patients were performed , as well as under the treatment of up laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body @-@ fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ er@@ ous and fa@@ ç@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ y of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ k@@ aler tissue . &quot;

HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ izing patients can be achieved at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ omatic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a ( 100 mg twice daily ) , some kind and incidence of side effects ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 3 and 4 ) were similar to patients who were treated with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequent . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if required , are necessary suppor@@ tive policies . &quot;

&quot; the antiv@@ ir@@ al activity of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro , against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B has been studied both in ak@@ age and chronic , ho@@ blast cells ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in periph@@ eral bleeding . &quot;
the 50 % in@@ corporation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ nest@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M on acute cells and amounts to the µ@@ M at chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the im@@ itation of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication for humans is not yet defined .
for the treatment of anti @-@ retro@@ spective patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were reported as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .
&quot; at sixteen of 434 , the 700@@ mg coll@@ on@@ avi@@ r have been received twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 732 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical pre@@ dictions see up to 48 mg , with 14 isol@@ ate genetic . &quot;

a prototype @-@ based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be applied to the estim@@ ation of activity of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ a@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / L / M / F / F / F , I@@ 86@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a stolen phenomen@@ al resistance with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a decreased lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of a vibr@@ ational response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation pattern can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ations to analyze the results of Resistance tests . &quot;
a phenomen@@ al @-@ based analyses of Clinical @-@ based analyses can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies to distribute diagnostic tests tests have been clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance testing .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity against am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r associated patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistant against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r , and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ r yet remains in general . &quot;
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ ers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resist@@ ors , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ ulator ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , o@@ und@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ca@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pu@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ izing @-@ resistant insulation ; the conservation of these activity seems to be dependent upon the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early @-@ time break@@ down of a vers@@ ag@@ ious therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open trial ( NR@@ TI@@ s twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side ( standard of care , so@@ c ) with a PI , predomin@@ antly with hum@@ ili@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a hundred and six@@ ty @-@ six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with weight@@ ed virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI , and at least one NR@@ TI@@ s were included in the division @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ discrimination of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the N@@ c @-@ PI ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plas@@ ma ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plas@@ ma ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plas@@ ma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ basement thresh@@ old of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution became taken at night@@ time and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg of three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with the NR@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks the patients had been included in the study included a plas@@ ma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the starting point .
19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered with the treatment optim@@ isation in accordance with PI @-@ treated children who are considered to be considered to be the benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
5@@ 08 % increases for C@@ max at 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ dou@@ gh@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the minimum concentration of the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) is in@@ affected by the nutritional intake , although the simultaneous nutritional intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent volume of volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ attached penetration of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plas@@ ma , with the amount of un@@ bund@@ ling am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r that remains the active share probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; during the absolute concentration of un@@ stopp@@ able am@@ big@@ avi@@ r remains , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active invent@@ ories during the pre @-@ concentration concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State above the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 will be in@@ ductive or in@@ hib@@ itions or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be given to caution at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg of three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r exposure as with adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r is made up of 14 % less bi@@ over@@ bearing than out of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al disorder is likely to be low to the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatments schem@@ es lead to Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ res comparable to those who are achieved in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous adoption of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for ch@@ anc@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity with Am@@ ber ra@@ viol@@ r on mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ atoms at doses ( cap ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ dou@@ gh@@ r , escap@@ ed . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas have not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear .
&quot; however , these findings from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application , however little hin@@ ts for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical tests , the bacterial reverse Mut@@ ation@@ st@@ ests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ ly@@ mph@@ oma @-@ test , micro@@ kern@@ els to rats and chromos@@ ome lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , was am@@ pl@@ ess neither mut@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored in clinical daily life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; previously , there has been no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients with no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase still after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in juven@@ ating which were treated from an age of 4 days , they showed a high mort@@ ality with the control of Am@@ ir@@ ca@@ i @-@ treated animals as well . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plas@@ ma position , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage when people lay , however , have observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and low skel@@ etal changes that indicate an del@@ ayed development . &quot;
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be applied without the ampli@@ fying additi@@ ve of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booklet ) must be applied to higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ dou@@ gh@@ r / kg of body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ dou@@ gh@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is intended to be done in patients with weak or lighter liver , with caution in patients with severe liver functioning , it is contra@@ sting ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standardi@@ zation ) , are available methods for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 27 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an elevated risk to a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vibr@@ ational failure and lead to a level of resistance .
5@@ 08 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ dou@@ gh@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min &apos;s values of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r in plas@@ ma , which were reached in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage for simultaneous adoption of Am@@ ir@@ ca@@ i and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ concei@@ vable of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with emit@@ ters in combination with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ mer would be low .
&quot; when these drugs are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; in simultaneous addition of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , together with A@@ gener@@ a , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ) is recommended for the possibility of a atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ co@@ er@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous creation of orth@@ o @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .

the 50 % in@@ corporation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ nest@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ F in acute cells and amounts to the µ@@ F in chronic cells ( 1 µ@@ F = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pu@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ur@@ izing @-@ resistant insulation ; the conservation of these activity seems to be dependent upon the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children who are considered to be considered by &quot; un@@ bund@@ les &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ stopp@@ able am@@ big@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active invent@@ ories during the pre @-@ concentration concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State above the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;

&quot; also , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a ren@@ al disorder is likely to be low to the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for ch@@ anc@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity with Am@@ ber ra@@ viol@@ r on mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ atoms at doses ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( arm@@ or ) of exposure to people after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas have not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear .
&quot; however , there are little hin@@ ts for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings as well as from the therapeutic application . however , little hin@@ ts for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genom@@ ics tests , the bacterial reverse Mut@@ ation@@ st@@ ests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ ly@@ mph@@ oma @-@ test , micro@@ kern@@ els to rats and chromos@@ ome lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , was am@@ pl@@ ess neither mut@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in juven@@ ating which were treated from an age of 4 days , they showed a high mort@@ ality with the control of Am@@ ir@@ ca@@ i @-@ treated animals as well . &quot;

the benefits of having Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to be taken neither with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r as a solution to capture is 14 % lower than by Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to be taken on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .

&quot; in addition , there is no dosage for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to be taken and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided in this combination with these patients . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment is not necessary for am@@ pl@@ ess , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is to be taken in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a tox@@ in reaction as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ on , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is to be taken at risk of inf@@ ants and children under 4 years of pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous adoption can lead to a competent inhibit@@ ing of the met@@ abolic medications and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening effects such as cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .

&quot; the cream is covered before bed@@ time th@@ inner to the affected skin areas , so that they left enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with War@@ zen in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; primary indic@@ t@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients treated with complete waste @-@ healing . • Al@@ dara was also treated to 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies , during which the patients were treated for six weeks or during the placebo , either daily or five times a week . &quot;

if the follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the untreated les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient was w@@ asted the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therap@@ ist plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream is adjustable in a thin layer and put into the cli@@ pped , with incl@@ ined skin region until the cream is complete . &quot;

&quot; local skin actions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decre@@ ases in general during therapy or reactions , after compl@@ eting the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary because of the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin actions , a treatment can be made from several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of therapy can be judged after the re@@ generation of treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , should be considered at super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al Bas@@ har al @-@ cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ ring and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not lie clinical experience , so the application is not recommended in previously untreated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial point out that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower chance of response to the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ose on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses to anatom@@ ical jobs outside the face and the sc@@ alp .
&quot; the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ent Ker@@ at@@ ose on the fore@@ arms and hands support the effectiveness of this application , so this application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin actions often occur , but these reactions usually take action over the course of therapy to intensity , or after putting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local routes actions can cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 acts as les@@ ions are a lower total healing rate referred to as patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mic@@ quim@@ od should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ te , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic battery , in a related 25 c@@ m2 major treatment are@@ als on the un@@ ha@@ iry sc@@ alp or in the face . &quot;
the year @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show patients with clinical acceptance after one or two treatment times a re@@ zi@@ di@@ v@@ rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indicator of vo@@ id@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles Bas@@ har in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients usually do not appear and were therefore not studied . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara cream has been studied in four random@@ ized , dou@@ bling @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , Plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od could not be shown in these studies with the doses ( 3x / Week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w ) .
a minimal system of the 5 % of the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentration in Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed and concrete 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12,@@ 5 mg , 1 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the clear@@ ed half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ @-@ hour half @-@ day after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study , which points to a prolonged re@@ tention of the drug in the skin . &quot;
data for systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od to top@@ ical application was low to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable to those with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al b@@ ail@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the edges , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG to significantly reduced weight @-@ weight and increased weight @-@ weight ; one also had four months a long run study to the der@@ mal application y@@ ielded with the mouse no similar effects . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ e@@ ability in moder@@ ator for three days a week in@@ duced no tum@@ ors in the application place .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od has only a small systemic absorption of human skin and is not mut@@ ed , is a risk to people due to systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice that was treated with the effective cream in the past and in larger numbers than in the control group with minimal U@@ VR .
&quot; it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice side effects that are not specified in this usage information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was examined , however it was also measured its effectiveness ( by using its effect regarding the reduction of the ag @-@ concentr@@ ations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; for children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ ag @-@ Konzentr@@ ationen in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver on the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , rash , rash , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , Hit@@ zeg@@ e@@ emp@@ l , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion of inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fever and sh@@ aken fro@@ st . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who are possibly highly sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; the European medicines ( E@@ MEA ) will update every year every new information that may be known , check and update this summary required . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is received patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission shared the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. , acqu@@ itted approval of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ kind α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cellular cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Eier@@ dence of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is a long @-@ term treatment therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ebox I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase lack ) indic@@ ating the non @-@ neurological manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient contributes to this , every 15 minutes in single disp@@ atch on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients cannot be recommended dosage schedule .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined and for these patients may not be recommended dosage schedule .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any related inci@@ dents which occurs during inf@@ usion or by the end of the inf@@ usion ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be monitored and monitored inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment in the re@@ distribution facilities for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected to virtually all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase usually within 3 months from treatment course . &quot;
&quot; patients , the antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; since little experience is due to resu@@ ming the treatment after a longer break , has to be careful due to the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after a break of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minim@@ ize the potential appearance inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of a slight or moderate @-@ severe inf@@ usion reaction should treat the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate aimed at half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
&quot; in case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be stopped inf@@ usion to consider symptoms of decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be cont@@ empl@@ ated . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be received with a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in the inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the predic@@ ted reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; animal experimental studies have not let into direct or indi@@ rect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to new@@ born , who were exposed to the mat@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to satisfy the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the effects of clinical trials were largely arranged as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were detected at 53 % of patients in phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( treatment period up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of age ( treatment period up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug actions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the period of 5 years or older with a total of 45 patients aged by up to 4 years ; are common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditioned participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history occurred in addition severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asm , breathing st@@ agn@@ es and facial hair ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children undes@@ irable medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during an Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with a predomin@@ antly severe form @-@ form and treatment of treatment up to 12 months , were reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous 100 e / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it came from 3 months after the treatment of treatment of a Ser@@ o@@ Conver@@ sion , whereby in the age of 5 years , with a weight@@ y delay of most often within a month to a Ser@@ o@@ Conver@@ sion ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) were reported by 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say si@@ ver@@ able antibodies , among which there has never been to Ser@@ o@@ konver@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; patients with ab@@ stain@@ ed up to low anti@@ body levels , a sturdy reduction of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti@@ body tit@@ ers was a variable reduction of G@@ ag in the Har@@ n . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alised inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to inter@@ f@@ ere the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be linked to the incidence of unwanted drugs - even though the incidence of unwanted drugs typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
&quot; the reason for the enzyme therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ate , and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzymes . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is swi@@ ft@@ ly removed from the circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , dou@@ bl@@ in@@ den , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled Phase 3 @-@ Study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study which were referred to the entire disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - housing test .
all patients have subsequently been recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study which they received for more than 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks therapy with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients compared to the placebo group and the ability to improve in the following table .
&quot; in an open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as well as from the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant over this period and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further propor@@ tional to the height of growing children .
the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ izer before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear@@ ance of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) found that remained constant up to the study .
&quot; with regard to the heter@@ ogen@@ eous path@@ ogen , which was taken into account for five patients ( 58 % ) , the clin@@ ically significant changes for five patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study carried out in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ology of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined for 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the middle flow form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 over the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
&quot; for several patients there was a size of size ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) , and all 4 patients with the middle flow form referred to a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients were limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
in a phase 4 study studies were carried out investigations into pharmac@@ odynam@@ ic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dos@@ de@@ schem@@ ata on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute case .
&quot; intraven@@ ous 100 e / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks in patients who are difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , an acceptable alternative , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ schem@@ es is equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate each new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ological profile of patients aged 5 years was similar to older and less strongly affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in were treated with an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared with 9,@@ 3 months at the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in patients who previously received an chemotherapy was the average survival of the A@@ lim@@ ta 8,3 months , compared with 7,@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies , patients , in which cancer is not caused by the record cell cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer life@@ times when it comes to compar@@ ative media . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission shared the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. &quot;
each penetration bottle must be raised with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of sodium @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the through@@ put bottle and with 0.@@ 9 % of sodium inj@@ ector ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml . ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ zin@@ om except for over@@ riding pl@@ atten@@ el@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - and metastatic non @-@ cell bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ zin@@ om except for excessive pl@@ atten@@ tiv@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of the body ( KO@@ F ) is given as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of ten minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ zin@@ om according to pre @-@ approved chemotherapy is the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F ranges from intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment life cycle .
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin actions , the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ G@@ abe as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid , and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy sessions as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage as well as after each third loading cycle .
&quot; in patients , the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created in front of any gift of a complete blood image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a t@@ rom@@ ol@@ zy@@ ten@@ ance . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate @-@ ase ( AP ) , Asp@@ art@@ at @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ check will be taking place under the re@@ medi@@ ation of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood stream or the maximum non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity of the prec@@ eding therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 to apply for ALI@@ M@@ TA as Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ inum . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute of Common toxic Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ hä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grad 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient needs the value prior to treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be can@@ cel@@ ed when in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ mic tox@@ icity or non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the presence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 Yahweh or in comparison to patients aged 65 years has an elevated out@@ going ris@@ ky .
ALI@@ AL@@ Y is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to not sufficient data for in@@ concei@@ vable and effectiveness .
clinical trials were necessary for patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with the liver functioning of the top B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bis limit and / or tran@@ sam@@ ic values of &gt; 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper border ( with de@@ - essential of liver metastatic disease ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper border ( in the presence of liver metastatic disease ) were not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored and monitored with regard to the expertise and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately has a value of ≥ 15 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing has a value of &gt; 100 000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dose of dosage for further cycles is based on the Nazis of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ic , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ance and maximum non @-@ domestic tox@@ icity , as it was observed in the previous treatment cycles - see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ports tox@@ icity such as Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was observed if a pre @-@ treatment was taking place with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; therefore all patients need to be dependent on patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ etic lact@@ ation measure to reduce tox@@ icity tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with easier to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous loss of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ logist@@ ical therapy ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and mind@@ set TE@@ NS 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which treatment is provided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re , the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds have to avoid the therapy for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , appropriate risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including deh@@ ydr@@ ation , pre@@ valent hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation , accumulation in trans@@ cellular space is a dra@@ inage of Erg@@ onom@@ ic in front of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ar@@ ine , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this active ingredient is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ tiv@@ eness ( except Yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contamin@@ ated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ ill@@ age , the reproductive ability is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised against the treatment - G@@ inn to get advice on the semen activation . &quot;
patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) can result in high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ logist@@ ic@@ acid ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re exp@@ ulsion with the result of a multip@@ ly occurrence of side effects .
&quot; therefore , be careful when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage . &quot;
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy period of therapy and mind@@ set 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; since there is no data regarding the intervention potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
&quot; the great in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of the straight@@ ening status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between or@@ al anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ) , if the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in Schw@@ ang@@ eren , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ alog@@ abolic disorders are expected to be severe mat@@ def@@ ects in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily , and after careful dis@@ appearance of the benefici@@ aries for the mother and risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an irre@@ ver@@ sible damage is caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised against the course starting point to get advice regarding the Sper@@ mak@@ on@@ ser@@ vie@@ to . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients in the treatment of treatment ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statist@@ ically significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and Dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the application of the Lun@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ a- tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two lines poor are characterized by enhancing the lung parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in @-@ arm and a susp@@ ect of the lung in the course of the ch@@ ecker in the control .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ized , open phase III trial with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous patients ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 283 ) and from 7,@@ 9 months in with doc@@ et@@ axel patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three major studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chem@@ otherap@@ ies received , which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and v@@ om@@ iting are 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and v@@ om@@ iting are shown 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 by 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission divided the company at Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the signing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is in@@ ad@@ or@@ ned : for prevention of acute nausea and v@@ om@@ iting with strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy due to cancer treatment and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is indu@@ ces by a strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ eous chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a prior to the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ nesses , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y or@@ ip@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection @-@ mes@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , be careful from the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with the Q@@ t- interval or which tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi is meant to be used in the days after chemotherapy not to prevent nausea and v@@ om@@ iting for the treatment of nausea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;

in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events like in the other dos@@ ages ; there were no dosage active relationships .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies conducted , but due to the large part of distribution is a di@@ aly@@ sis , but probably not effective therapy with an al@@ oh@@ an over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized twin @-@ blind@@ ness studies were given a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate em@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 2 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was given by day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;

the results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy , in@@ duced nausea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the appropriate effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron poss@@ esses the ability to block the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization of the ic@@ onic channels and to extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
the aim of the survey conducted by 221 healthy volunteers an assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2,25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption By intraven@@ ous G@@ abe follows on a initi@@ als of the plas@@ ma @-@ concentration a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plas@@ ma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the same time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose area of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tional .
intraven@@ ous G@@ abe of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average rate of 11 Ho@@ den@@ os@@ yn@@ ge@@ o @-@ plas@@ mas@@ on@@ ation between day 1 and day 5 cans was charged by the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plas@@ ma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations that he reached a daily basis for once daily intraven@@ ous G@@ abe from 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron after 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the setup of 0.75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which are compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron about less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in accordance with CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron for about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ in@@ jek@@ tion at Ges@@ unds , the overall body @-@ clear@@ ance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver , the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination of elim@@ ination and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , but a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies have been observed only according to Ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient on the maximum human@@ ic exposure , which indicates a small relevance to clinical use . &quot;
10 From clinical studies have hin@@ ts that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ enk@@ ins that are involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can extend the shar@@ eholder period .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was im@@ pris@@ oned in about the 30@@ f@@ uss of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every day over two years , led to an increased incidence of Leb@@ ert@@ um@@ ors , end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ines Neop@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , r@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and Hau@@ tt@@ um@@ ors at rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not complete , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi determines when people used to be unique application , the relevance of these results will be evaluated for people . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee for Human@@ ist@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) had a negative expertise in which the approval of the approval of hep@@ atitis C is intended to treat the treatment of hep@@ atitis C 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ector solution .
&quot; this means that Alph@@ eon is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ t@@ onal effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference material &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long analog ) hep@@ atitis C ( a viral infection disease ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the hep@@ atic tissue damage , moreover , the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ ms Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood stream . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon put data prior to the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the medication , mode , safety and effic@@ acy in hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference rate of 455 patients .
&quot; in the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatments , as well as 6 months after the treatment of treatment were referred to the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have been reported that data on the stability of the active ingredients and of the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial . &quot;
after setting up the treatment with al@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ated the disease in more patients once more than with the reference rate ; also Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
&quot; apart from that , the test results in the study was fail@@ ing to examine the issue that medication is immune to immune to the body ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drugs ) , not sufficiently valid@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cru@@ st@@ acking skin @-@ infection ) and small in@@ infected lazy ( cr@@ ack or cutting ) , shut@@ down and se@@ perate wo@@ unds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ lip @-@ sten@@ te St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this type of infections may not affect .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not talking about two to three days of treatment , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by block@@ ing the bacterial re@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hibit the growth of bacteria .
&quot; the main course of the effectiveness was achieved in all five studies of the proportion of patients , their infection after the end of the treatment was sealed . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.7 % ) of 71 patients taking placebo on the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ ins , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ iel were similar to response : if the results of both studies were gathered together in Hau@@ tw@@ os , about 90 % of the patients of both groups on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies it has been found that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused by the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ess ( failed cav@@ ity in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or thought by MR@@ SA is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the order .
&quot; the committee for human resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go can be seen in the short @-@ time treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections towards the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small Laz@@ ations , con@@ di@@ ced or se@@ ated wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission divided the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the whole European Union . &quot;
patients in which there are no improvement in which within two to three days should not be examined once again and considered an altern@@ ativ@@ es@@ otherapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ bil@@ isation , or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be , the treatment should be interrupted carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogens or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary open wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin used in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ icillin resist@@ ent St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected body .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds at the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations , which were reached with people after top@@ ical use on the skin or infected superf@@ icial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous or@@ bit of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin CO@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients need dosage adjustment not required , if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ produc@@ tion@@ sto@@ x@@ icity according to or@@ aler intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the birth and the fat / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should be applied only during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ating and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin gene is prefer@@ able .
&quot; when deci@@ ding if the breastfeeding continued / ends , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued to termin@@ ate , is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ants and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which have been used by Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation at the appointment , which is about 1 % of the patient . &quot;

the Wir@@ km@@ ek@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a particular binding point of the 50s of the bacterial re@@ bos@@ oms that differ from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ating anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bind@@ ing of the bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bond branch and the Pep@@ ti@@ zia transfer@@ as@@ ement center .
&quot; by binding on this bonds , Pl@@ euro@@ at@@ til@@ ine inhibit@@ ing the pep@@ ti@@ dyl@@ transfer , block@@ ing partial P @-@ bond interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; if the local pre@@ valence of Resistance in the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infectious forms , a consultation must be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate was sensitive or resistant to meth@@ icillin . &quot;

&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wo@@ unds , individual plas@@ ma ro@@ ben were won . &quot;
the sam@@ pling took place on days 3 or 4 at the adult patients in front of the medication and for the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .

&quot; if a r@@ acket is desired against hep@@ atitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hep@@ atitis A@@ - or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vaccines have a functioning of the immune system ( the natural decay of the body ) &quot; as it can be opposed to a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as that since 1996 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given within the framework of three doses existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults includes identical ingredients , some of the data that use the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main course of the effectiveness was the share of the vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection , a protective an@@ em@@ bodi@@ ment concentration . &quot;
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine has been compared with a sixteen @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection on the development of protective an@@ em@@ bodi@@ ment operations against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had been similar to an eagle - and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( ob@@ serves as 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ aches , appetite , p@@ ains at the inj@@ ector , redness , mat@@ ing ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not respond to patients who may possibly re@@ tender ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not to be used . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ Un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a r@@ acket is desired for hep@@ atitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines or combined with a combination of combination . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis , anti @-@ hep@@ atitis , anti @-@ hep@@ atitis , anti @-@ hep@@ atitis , anti @-@ hep@@ atitis - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines . &quot;
&quot; it is not completely assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent people have addressed to a hep@@ atitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as they may also need any more det@@ ectable antibodies to be protected by the immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
3 As with all injection of inj@@ uries should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine due to the medical treatment and monitoring are always immediately available .
&quot; if a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is necessary , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended using the combined hep@@ atitis B , the 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis B @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface surface . &quot;
&quot; with ha@@ unting patients and individuals with distur@@ b@@ ances of the immune system , after the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ il@@ isation under circumstances is not worth an adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ body , so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required . &quot;
as an intra@@ oc@@ ular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal it could lead to a sub@@ optimal vacc@@ ination should be avoided this inj@@ ections should be avoided .
&quot; however , the Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected as the ambi@@ ance of sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting , since it may occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular addition to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix had been given in the second life year in the form of a separated inj@@ uries , tet@@ racycl@@ ine , in@@ activated Poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ en@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mas@@ quer@@ ading @-@ vaccine , was the immune response to all Anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immun@@ def@@ ects must be assumed that there is no sufficient immune response .
&quot; in a clinical trial , which was carried out with 3 vacc@@ ination of these form@@ ulation in adults , was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gastro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency that has been observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot;
20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations took place at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix had been compared to the combination of the 3 @-@ doses combinations .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mattress on a Calcul@@ ation basis per vacc@@ d@@ osis Ambi@@ rix but not on a comp@@ amount basis per person .
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the prob@@ es after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combinations . &quot;
&quot; after the whole vaccine @-@ cycle reported 66,@@ 4 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix had given rise above pain , compared with 6@@ 3.6 % in the prob@@ es that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combinations . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mattress was comparable to high ( i.e. about the total vacc@@ ination at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who got Ambi@@ rix compared with 36,@@ 2 % in the prob@@ es that received the 3 @-@ doses combined ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence were low and comparable , which was observed after administration of the combination of combined with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study at 1- or 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ination , the appearance of loc@@ alization and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis B @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g @-@ combined hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination has been reported on vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix ( at the injection station ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the share of vacc@@ inations , which reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination of 360 E@@ LI@@ SA@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis B @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g @-@ combined hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , which were conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years were the Ser@@ o@@ Conver@@ sion@@ sr@@ aten for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99.9 % a month after the first dose , and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ converter rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4,2 % a month after the first dose , and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was carried out at 12@@ - until , including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the default combination with three doses . &quot;
&quot; with the 28@@ 9 persons , whose immun@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity was worth@@ less ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose mim@@ ic it significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune answers that have been achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1- or 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ inations took either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ active hep@@ atitis B @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g @-@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in people who were at the time of pri@@ st@@ ism between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; in this study , immun@@ ode@@ reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination of hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g @-@ combined hep@@ atitis B surface surface in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial with 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
&quot; when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix had made up a combined di@@ ph@@ ther@@ mic , tet@@ racycl@@ ine , in@@ activated poly@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ en@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ king @-@ m@@ ist @-@ vaccine @-@ vaccine , was the immune response to all Anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of the present wor@@ ding in adults , showed for the current form@@ ulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ors and Ser@@ o@@ Conver@@ sion@@ sr@@ ences as well as for earlier form@@ ulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ ur@@ ination by sight @-@ on foreign banks and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; in accordance with Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC @-@ changed version , the state @-@ based character will be carried out by a state laboratory or any of the authorized laboratory . &quot;

&quot; hep@@ atitis A virus is commonly transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as bathing in through dra@@ ined waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( laughter ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ inations , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against an infection with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus , even though the complete vacc@@ ination has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you are infected with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus due to your child before the administration of both vaccines or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick ) a vaccine may not prevent a vaccine .
&quot; a protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those after a hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can be seen through it@@ chy r@@ ashes , respiratory or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have played an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • if you have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the intended adoption of the second vacc@@ ination ) . &quot;
at a possible risk of an infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
&quot; instead , he will recommend you with your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis A@@ - / hep@@ atitis B vaccine with a decreased amount of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased amount of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine protection against the vacc@@ ination .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from persons who suffer from severe blood@@ stream disorders , suffer from the skin and not in the muscle . • if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your own physical de@@ bit , or if you / your child has under@@ gone a ha@@ unting . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immun@@ ologist &apos;s response can not be sufficient , so a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to the vaccine is . &quot;
&quot; 21 sag@@ as your doctor if you are taking / your child further medicines ( including those that you have been vacc@@ inated , or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / has been given or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given or that in the near future is planned . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated with separate places and as possible as different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix are at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is nonetheless enough . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix Schw@@ ang@@ eren or breastfeeding women will not be administ@@ ered but it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inated both against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B . &quot;
important information about particular other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
it is very common ( more than 1 case per 10 ver@@ im@@ per cans ) : • P@@ ains or complaints at the classification or redness • mat@@ ernity • App@@ et@@ ability • head@@ aches • App@@ et@@ it@@ defic@@ iency

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data that has become known since issu@@ ance of the first author@@ ization for the entry , the CH@@ MP believe that the benefit @-@ risk @-@ ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix had only been present in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data is limited to this medicine due to the low patient position . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme or with hyper@@ op@@ ic enzyme inhibit@@ ing ( brain result as a result of high ammon@@ i@@ ac concentr@@ ations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ium is - split to several individual doses to meals - swal@@ lowed which are mixed by food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach of leading tube ) .
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Ammon@@ aps cannot be compared to any other treatment or with placebo ( a head@@ line , i.e. without medication ) . &quot;
&quot; Ammon@@ ia can also lead to appeal loss , a down@@ ward pur@@ age in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , head@@ ache , hydr@@ ation , nausea , nausea , nausea , nausea , rash , nausea , v@@ om@@ iting , or weight gain . &quot;
the committee for human resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Ammon@@ aps in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ureth@@ ral cycle to high Ammon@@ i@@ ac levels .
ammon@@ ium was allowed under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval was limited information on this drug .
the use is in all patients indi@@ ces in which a complete enzyme already mani@@ f@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 life @-@ days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ing form ( in@@ complete enzyme ) , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life , then an indicator of the application if in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is an hyper@@ a@@ em@@ ic enzyme . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with gor@@ illa disorders AM@@ MONA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and for the growth and development of the daily protein up@@ take of the patient . &quot;
&quot; after recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of weight over 20 kg and with adol@@ esc@@ ents and adults . &quot;
patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ thes@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with an argin@@ ine cc@@ ini defic@@ iency need to be Argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered patients with gor@@ illa disorders , as a risk for the emergence of o@@ est@@ oph@@ age@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets are not right away in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as with sodium and o@@ de@@ mb@@ ination of clinical trials only with caution . &quot;
&quot; as met@@ abolic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at on the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore controversi@@ al ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ians G@@ abe from phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 to 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a stolen loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a del@@ ayed ag@@ eing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain @-@ growth .
&quot; it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is taken into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the lact@@ ation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS joined 56 % of patients at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events had gone out that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ kt@@ ischen patient who developed a met@@ abolic enzyme , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ creat@@ itis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old inf@@ ant with a different single d@@ osis of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate dra@@ in which in a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ iti@@ ful neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound called acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine con@@ jug@@ ated by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen @-@ atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for every gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival nu@@ ances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ gn@@ osis of the early manifest form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious and the disease himself led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or their stu@@ d @-@ free an@@ alogue within the first lifetime of death .
&quot; by Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the uti@@ lization of aging paths of nit@@ rogen ( sodium diet ) , protein @-@ reduced fare and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rates of post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) diagnostic diseases on 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients , whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and that was already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ op@@ ic enzyme was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time for many intellectual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ing form of the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ o@@ zy@@ g@@ ots form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase @-@ man@@ ure ) , which were treated with a hyper@@ a@@ em@@ ic enzyme and after that permanently with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the super @-@ rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological defic@@ its are also very rever@@ sible and in some patients may occur a further deteri@@ oration of the neurological conditions .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ox@@ idi@@ zed , which is built in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with Glut@@ amine , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his metabol@@ ites in plas@@ ma and urine were obtained by 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in wet healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to individual adjustments as well as repet@@ itive gifts of or@@ al doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined for cancer patients after intraven@@ ous G@@ abe from Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were found 15 minutes after the intake of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ureth@@ ane cir@@ cuits or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ os@@ opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) next morning after night@@ ly fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plas@@ ma .
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three singles ) in plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ res on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
&quot; the medication is removed within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses treated with toxic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after the administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken oral ( inf@@ ants and children , which can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with pe@@ eling ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ achs or a rhin@@ oc@@ son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; after recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ born babies , inf@@ ants and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of weight over 20 kg and with adol@@ esc@@ ents and adults . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood stream to the heart ) , for example when un@@ ab@@ ili@@ ated Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ osau@@ r ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value with electro@@ kar@@ ogra@@ m or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; will angi@@ ox applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ ots in patients who apply to a PCI , a higher dose will be administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; roughly 14 000 patients participated in the main study involving the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in all@@ some gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combinations of hep@@ at@@ ine ( a different anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arteries to prevent a lock ) , and they received additional medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI , in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who were subjected to a PCI , angi@@ ox was equally effective in relation to all indicators just as effective as hep@@ atitis , except for severe bleeding when it was considerably more effective than hep@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other pi@@ ud@@ ine or any of the ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as in people with strong hyper@@ tension , or severe kidney problems , or a heart infection . &quot;
the committee for human resources ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that angi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and a PCI is a decent replacement for hep@@ atitis .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission shared the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the author@@ isation of angi@@ ox in the whole European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever ) at a emergency @-@ handle or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ alization of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt from 0.1 mg / kg by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out in another sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and inf@@ usion to the duration of the intervention on 1,75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after PCI it is possible after clinical requirements again the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg must be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended Dos@@ age of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ als intraven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a hier@@ archy of immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened under 225 seconds , a second bolt should be made from 0.3 mg / kg / weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ed and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed and administ@@ ered the bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion is properly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate @-@ severe kidney functioning ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated to a PCI ( if with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; is the ACT @-@ value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.3 mg / kg to be administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ Study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , included in the ACT value 5 minutes after gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment on average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ tic patients is angi@@ ox contra@@ inde@@ xed ( see under section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of intraven@@ ous lig@@ ar@@ ine or 8 hours after termination of sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue of low @-@ molecular nuclear @-@ ar@@ ine .
• well @-@ known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itivity to the active ingredients or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood risk . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible hyper@@ tension . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitor during treatment and signs of blood pressure especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is given in combination with another Anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if PCI @-@ patients appear in case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most of the bleeding may occur in patients suffering from a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients , war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ uses should be considered to ensure that the value after putting the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ uses should be achieved before the treatment of existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the mechanisms of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ ar@@ ine , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ ne@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these drugs increase the blood of blood . &quot;
the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ aggreg@@ ate numbers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in each case regularly control .
&quot; the animal experimental studies are inadequate in terms of health , embryonic / fet@@ al development , the delivery or the Post@@ nat@@ al development in@@ sufficient ( see under section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ fr@@ active Hep@@ ar@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the with Hep@@ ar@@ ine @-@ treated compar@@ isons , it came more common in women as well as in patients with more than 65 years more likely to undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and heavy bleeding came significantly less frequently than in groups with hep@@ atitis plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ os@@ ru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ inhibit@@ or ( see chart 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y heavy blood pressure was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ation , retro@@ sp@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ oc@@ ular blood pressure , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter of ≥ 5 cm / dl with famous bleeding point , re@@ mit due to a blood pressure , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;

the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who subjected to a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the with Hep@@ ar@@ ine @-@ treated compar@@ isons , it came more common in women as well as in patients with more than 65 years more likely to undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients . &quot;

&quot; the bond@@ age of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , in turn , the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly folds , thereby re@@ generate the function of the active centre of th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , adol@@ esc@@ ents and children from six years with diabetes , which require a treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ ted ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the thig@@ h or the upper @-@ arm or as inf@@ usion with a ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to control the gl@@ ucose pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin is not effective .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very low of human@@ ic ulin and the change means that it works faster and a shorter lead time has a short @-@ term human@@ ic ulin .
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in the application in combination with a long@@ efficient ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body is not able to produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin not be used effectively , Ap@@ id@@ ra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main course of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the gly@@ cos@@ mopolit@@ an hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.05 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % in ulin @-@ l@@ is@@ pro .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was reduced to 50 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.20 % in human@@ ly Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be used in patients who may be overweight ( allergic ) against ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may have to be adapted if it is possible to work together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glu@@ cos@@ ms .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission divided the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ av@@ ent@@ is Germany GmbH for approval from Ap@@ id@@ ra throughout the European Union . &quot;
Ap@@ id@@ ra is referred to as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections either in the area of the abdom@@ inal ceiling of the tor@@ ches or to use sub@@ t@@ ut@@ an through continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the abdom@@ en .
&quot; due to the decreased gl@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ inst@@ able changes , the ins@@ ulin requires in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active volume , the mark ( herds ) , of ins@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ del@@ ayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturer method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or the break@@ up of a treatment , particularly in patients with a ins@@ ular diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ acid@@ osis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ int@@ yp or a ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage necessary .
the time of the occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the drug profile of the type of ins@@ ulin and can therefore change from the treatment of treatment schem@@ es .
