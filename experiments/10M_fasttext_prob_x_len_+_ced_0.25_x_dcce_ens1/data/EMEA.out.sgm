<seg id="5">"B. wirres thinking and vocations, hallucinations (hearing, or conceptions of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • Bipolar disorder, in which the patients manic episodes (periods can be normal) with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe bacteria episodes, and to the prevention of Manic episodes in patients who addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection-resolution will be applied to rapid control of gestural unrest or behavioral disorders when the orale intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be taken at nightly or the melting tablets in patients are used to make the swallow of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines simultaneously, which are just as Abilify, should be adapted to the dose of Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably appears especially as a "partial aggression" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in common dimensions than the neurotransmitters works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine can play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, wearing Aripiprazol to normalise the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent re-emergence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies about up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution has been carried out in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from gested unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in a further study, Abilify was killed over twelve weeks at 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo, compared to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injector solution was suffered from a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from gested unrest (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo for a period of two hours compared to a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients were based on the basis of a standard therapy for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who talked to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body absorbs the melt-coated tablets and the solution to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution shown patients who received the Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying to the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify in four of the five short-time studies are more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented also more effective up to 74 weeks as placebo for the re-occurrence manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms dotted unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale interference (uncontrollable), pertinence (soaking), irritation (constipation), stimulation and exhaustion, restlessness, insummer (insomnia) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee for human resources (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episode in patients who were predominantly manic episodes in which the manic episodes associated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="26">"also, the committee also came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of gestural unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission shared the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the signing of Abilify across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of Bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a locking dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness at doses on a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients with 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initiation group should be considered, if clinical factors this justify it (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 Induster is set out of combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicide behaviour belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased addiction to Aripiprazol in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be applied with caution in patients with renowned cardiovascular disease (myocardinarine or ischaemic disease, conditions which apply to hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia) or hypertension (including accelerated and maligne form)."</seg>

<seg id="48">"due to the primary effects of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, be careful when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines such as seperation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, with this effect as clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy subjects increased a high-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) the AUC by Aripiprazol around 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to expect other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be similar dosage reduction."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites can result in common use with high-effective inhibitors by CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration by Aripiprazol, compared to CYP2D6 extensiven metabolic disorders."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of ketoconazol or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits of potential risks to patients."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore should have similar dosage reduction."</seg>

<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY can be reckoned with a moderate increase in the Aripimatzol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol a day do not have significant effect on the metabolites of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextromethmorphan / 3-Methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C9 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should get out to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for security in humans and due to which in the reproductive studies, this drug should not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk to the fetus."</seg>
